"During the Texas ice storm, my wife and I lost everything.","We lived in an apartment, we were prepared for the electricity to go out and the water to be cut off. We packed a small go bag just in case with some food in it. 

I was laying on the floor, trying to game plan life.
Lost my job due to the pandemic, my mom only has so much time left (cancer), and struggling with depression. I heard my wife speak up in concern; there was the sound of water rushing through our walls. I then looked up to the ceiling and saw water pouring from the light fixtures, the bottom of the floor, the carpets swelling.
My wife began having a panic attack, I told her to ""grab the kids and go to the car"". I grab the go bag and tried to save anything I could, it wasn't very much at all. (We had just gotten married, so we had wedding gifts) just some food and medicine really. 

The fire sprinkler system bursted and flooded our apartment in 3 minutes. And just like that 10 years of hard work, buying items to chase a temporary happiness, All the things I couldn't like go of. 
Were just gone. 

When insurance paid, My wife and I made the decision to instead of buying new things (other than the essentials), we should truly invest in ourselves.
I just finished trade school, and we now have a savings to put toward our future. I never realized how much the things I owned truly owned me. We lost everything but we really were blessed with a fresh start.",minimalism,1617299083.0
Something growing up poor taught me that I didn’t realise until I was an adult,"A common side effect of growing up poor is growing up in a cluttered house because nothing was ever thrown away. Every single item of clothing I’ve ever owned has been handed down/donated, things are repaired over and over instead of replaced and anything that that could possibly be used one day is kept “just in case”. Until I was an adult I thought that only actual literal *rubbish* was thrown away. This made decluttering hard, because I was trying too hard to repair/repurpose/donate/sell everything. Bags of clothes would sit in my car for months, broken items would stay in my house with the intention of fixing to either sell or donate, but of course no one would probably want it anyway. I was getting so frustrated and putting myself under so much pressure until I realised... if something is at the end of its useful life to me, and is not worth selling or donating, I can thank it for it’s service and just... throw it away.

The Dark Side of Minimalism,"Have been on this sub for a while and I just have to get something off my chest. I apologize if this offends any of you.

I love living a minimalist lifestyle. Fewer experiences feel more liberating than when you’re relinquishing yourself of items that are of no use or significance.

If there’s one issue I have about this sub-culture, it’s the people. I don’t know if I’m out of the loop or something, but there are some of you who are really fuckin angry. Multiple posts complaining about receiving gifts, jokes at their expense for being minimalist, comments on wearing the same thing everyday, etc. Is this really a cause for concern for you?

Did someone give you a gift that you didn’t want? Donate it.

Did someone make a joke about you being minimalist or for wearing the same thing everyday? Say “thanks for noticing” and get over it.

I don’t understand the anger that so many people have towards non-minimalists. This is a new thing to a lot of people. They may not understand what we do and that’s fine. They may or may not change. You’re not oppressed. Stop acting like you’re constantly being disrespected. 

Don’t tell me to be calm. I AM CALM!",minimalism,1629156211.0
Wear your “Best Outfit” when clothes shopping,"I'm on a low-buy year, but I do occasionally have to purchase or replace clothing items. One trick I've been using is to wear a really great or favorite outfit when I go shopping. 

This allows me to easily compare how the new clothing item looks, feels and fits. If it's not up to the standard of my favorite outfit, it's easy to say no. 

I did this recently when I needed to replace a dress that was my go-to nice/more formal outfit. I wore it to the store, and basically it became a game...  Dress vs. Dress! Find a new dress that can beat the old one! Ask yourself, would you be willing to leave behind the old clothing item and only take the new one home? 

It really helps me get into the right mindset when shopping. Plus, it can help if you have a tendency to just buy for the sake of novelty and then have a closet full of clothes you never wear. This trick is helping me avoid falling back into those bad habits.",minimalism,1653743866.0
You guys put so much thought into what’s minimalist and what’s not that it ends up deceiving the purpose of minimalism,I’m always seeing posts about “is this minimalist” or “do I have too many [blank]” and stuff like that but that’s actively going against the point of minimalism IMO. Owning what YOU feel is enough to reduce spending and stress is what this is about but when you’re asking opinions of others and actively worrying if you’re fitting the lifestyle is counterproductive. My idea of what’s enough is going to differ from yours and that’s ok.,minimalism,1611456289.0
"Why is everyone in US cities obsessed with goals and grind? There is nothing wrong with your goal being to play video games, or live off a home-farm.","Title. It seems to me everyone around me aged 25+ is so obsessed with just giving more of their time to a corporation or only caring about what their income is. I work in retail management and I sometimes tell people I don't know if I even want to move up, I want time to be able to play the new Metroid game on the switch. Replay pokemon games. Go on a random trip to a car show 4 hours away.

My goal in life is NOT give a company 40 years of service until i die. Even my parents all they do is work, get home to sit on the couch to watch netflix....and they tell me how I need to be more ambitious at work.

I'm ambitious at life! I've traveled across the world to asia, europe, north america. I've worked in Hong Kong with a totally different culture and met people I will never meet in the US. 

I live minimally so that any full-time minimum wage job would still pay enough for me to live in NY. No need to stress about climbing the ladder.

At this point the only use I see in climbing any ladder is to be able to save more so I can quit working even sooner.

But Im the one that lacks ambition because it isn't to devote my life to a company that doesn't care for me and only have free time once I'm too old to do anything.

No thanks. Minimalism has opened my eyes to what I really need. It isn't a house with 3 extra rooms I don't need. It isn't an expensive car that just came out that will lose 50% of its value in the first 3 years and works just as well as a good condition car that costs less than 20k.

Edit: I'm not saying that hobbies can't be physically demanding. But when we do hobbies it is out of desire not necessity so we can do it when we want to.

Edit edit: thank you all for so many responses I can't keep up. So many of you are giving great feedback. Many of you enjoy your jobs and that is awesome! I do hope that we can get to a point where people can do what they want without disrespect even if it doesn't matchup exactly with what the norm is. For now I'm just saving and investing a good chunk of my income. Hopefully someday to have a good financial buffer.",minimalism,1627447220.0
I made $100 selling my belongings at a yard sale. It wasn’t worth it.,"I began decluttering as a first step towards minimalism. But I got a little greedy thinking I could make some money off of selling my things in a neighborhood yard sale. And also feel less guilty about acquiring all this stuff. I spent the whole evening in a mad rush beforehand gathering, pricing and preparing. The next day was 5 hours of haggling with strangers over prices. The money was just not worth the irritation. And seeing all the stuff that would probably end up in a landfill was a little depressing tbh. I could have spent that time playing with my son, hanging with friends, choosing self care or really just anything else that didn’t put focus on “things”. Our time is so limited on this planet that it was at least a valuable lesson in my step towards minimalism.",minimalism,1643664254.0
Important Realization for Young People Starting to Live Alone - your parents no longer have a say in what you own.,"I recently moved out and my parents did everything they could to make my transition as smooth as possible, including providing me with a large amount of stuff from their house. I initially started bringing back things I didn't need but that was met with hostility, as my parents who want the best for me kept pushing that I keep everything just in case. 
It took a solid 6 months before I stumbled on an important truth: your parents (or anyone) no longer have a say in what you own or what your living quarters look like. That means they are unlikely to notice when you get rid of:
- clothes they got you but that you don't like
- furniture they might have given you
- excessive items, especially in the bathroom and kitchen.
Not sure how helpful this is, but it was like a weight removed off my shoulders, especially considering their disapproval of minimalism.
Hope this can be helpful for someone in a smiliar situation!

"Yes, unfriending ""friends"" on social media is counted as de-cluttering","I posted a few days ago about how I de-cluttered my room by getting rid of all the unnecessary things that I didn't even know was there, and it gave me a sense of freedom. Not because I have more space to put in new stuff, but because I was rid of all the unnecessary things I was holding on to. So I figured, why stop with just things?

I read about digital minimalism some time ago, and it turns out, you could be just as cluttered online as you are with your surroundings. So I thought maybe I should de-clutter my social media as well.

Just a bit of background, I have deleted a lot of my social media accounts (Twitter, instagram, snapchat), I kept reddit, because reddit is awesome, and Youtube, because it's like my TV. I also kept facebook but only because my school gives important announcements there instead of our institutional emails for some reason, I don't really use it as much.

So in order to make my social media use intentional, I starting purging my facebook since last year, deleting all my posts up until 2009, making all my photos private, removing my personal info (such as hometown, school, favorite movies, sports, music), and my last agenda, unfriending ""friends"".

This was tougher than I thought. I had about 1,600+ friends and I never really thought about why I kept adding random people back then. Anyway it was a tedious process, but I managed to cut down all my friends from 1,600+ to just 647, which is still a lot, but considering how many people I had back then, this is big. I kept those that I know personally, and I have talked with at some point in my life, but for sure I will start unfriending those I haven't talked to in like over a year. 

Having that many people who can publicly view your personal life, or maybe talk to you really gave me anxiety and somewhat also put some pressure on me. I didn't know many of these people but here they are lurking around ready to stalk or judge me remotely (which is why I deleted my posts). And it's just liberating to be rid of all these people who probably don't even know I exist, so I just put them in my digital trash bag and got rid of them.

So like when I de-cluttered my room, de-cluttering my digital presence also gave me a sense of freedom. Knowing that I didn't actually lose anything, but instead I gained more peace for myself. And now I'm just left with myself and the people who matter the most to me. And I guess that's what counts, right?",minimalism,1617020405.0

We paid off our house!,"Long before I'd met my husband, he bought a very reasonably-priced house in his early 20s. He's inherently a minimalist. I've adapted my lifestyle (pretty easily) to become minimalist over the past few years, thanks to living with him. By being minimal, we've saved lots of money on things we don't need and paid off our house in our early 30s! I feel like I can't share this excitement with most of our friends, so just wanted to share with you all how we've seen this lifestyle work out for us!

Edit: because a few people have commented on this - we did tell immediate family, and they were excited for us! We haven't told friends because many of them are in really tough places financially and we don't want to rub it in their faces.

JOMO = Joy of Missing Out,"I've been watching a lot of Simple Happy Zen on youtube lately and she talks about a concept opposite of FOMO (fear of missing out) which is JOMO (joy of missing out)!

I just thought this was brilliant when I first heard it and it's reframed a lot of the ways I look at things, such as:

* Shopping: you might experience FOMO if you pass up the opportunity to buy something, but what about the joy of having one less thing in your home, and having space instead?
* Tasks: The ""slow living"" approach to life might reduce the number of tasks you do in a day as you approach them more intentionally and mindfully. Even sitting around quietly and enjoying doing ""nothing"" instead of trying to be 100% productive all the time can bring a lot of joy... that's the joy of missing out.
* Events: If something's happening socially and you simply don't want/need to attend, don't worry about what you're missing... enjoy the mental peace and clarity that can come with staying at home instead.
* Information: If you decrease time spent reading news or watching videos or TV, then you'll be taking in less information. But what is that info really doing for you? If you could devote more quality energy to one show at a time, reading a book, talking directly to friends etc, you can experience the benefits of focusing on one thing instead of many.

Space (physical, mental, and emotional) is often more joyful than objects or events that might otherwise fill it.",minimalism,1626201351.0

My family was amazing with minimalist Christmas gifts,"My non-minimalist family rocked minimalist Christmas gifts this year. Since all their ideas are outside of the usual advice about gift certificates, experiences, and food, I figured I'd share them as inspiration.

**My aunt** **made me a very detailed family tree**. She researched both her side of the family and my mom's side. It goes back to the 1600s and must have taken her an eternity to put together (she's retired and said it was her lockdown project). She also brought a lot of supporting documents with her to my parents' house, including my great-grandma's diary from WWI-era Germany. This project inspired my dad to get out the old family photographs he had, and we were able to add a lot of detail, like what professions people had, and match photos to names.

**My dad** **paid for a tent I'd already bought.** In September, he heard me gushing about this amazing backpacking tent I'd just bought myself and said ""Can I get you that as a Christmas present?"" To put it under the tree for Christmas morning, he made a little tent out of paper, and wrapped that in a box with a check for what the tent cost.

Technically, the tent is from both of my parents, but my mom is the kind of person who really likes to give physical presents. She also got me a beautiful basket from a local artist that I love and some coasters that I don't. The best part about her gift is that she volunteered, ""If you don't think this stuff matches your decor, I won't be offended if you leave it here."" Thanks for the basket, and enjoy your new coasters, mom!

For stocking stuffers, ""Santa"" (= mom) gave me useful consumables, including **hand sanitizer** and **a COVID test.**

Bonus win: **My dad asked for a photo scanner for Christmas.** My parents are getting up there in age, and my mom has 35 photo albums. She didn't want to leave me thousands of family photos to sort through while grieving. In the days after Christmas, my dad had everybody go through all the albums and put a sticker next to photos they want digital copies of. He's going to scan the photos we actually care about and put them in the cloud. Then, my mom's going to put her 100 favorite prints into one album and toss the rest.

I feel so lucky that my family actually listens to me about not wanting lots of stuff, and so impressed with their creativity in giving me such awesome and meaningful gifts.",minimalism,1641129567.0

Had our We Don't Need All this Stuff moving sale yesterday and... valuable life lesson learned.,"Over the last 15-20 years, hubs and I fell into the trap of the Modern American Dream.  Bigger houses, more crap to fill them.  Over the last 10 years, we've gone from a 3600 sq foot home 'in town' to a 2800 sq ft home we built (across the road) on 32 acres.

It was crushing us.  I didn't want to part with all the stuff, and he had his own 'stuff' he didn't want to throw away/give away/ donate.  It was consuming our free time to keep it all clean, displayed, dusted, polished, the yard and flower beds and pool maintained and looking spotless.  We were losing ourselves under the weight of it all.

It felt right to put the house and land on the market 18 months ago.  It sold at the very end of the 6 month realtor contract.  We built a much smaller, more modest home on our land across the road, and three weekends ago, we moved in.  We vowed to keep only what we desperately loved and needed, and to sell/donate/give away/throw away what was left.

After parting out heirlooms to family and taking home what we wanted, then paring THAT down, and opening up our storage unit yesterday, we were left with a literal stock trailer of... stuff.

Goodwill 30 miles away was full up - they couldn't take anymore stuff.

Goodwill 60 miles away picked through it all, took the cream, left the rest.  We have 3/4 of a stock trailer to try to dispose of either by selling on FBMP or sending to a landfill.

Here is my point:  We were both pretty quiet on the drive home.  Hubs and I were considering the vast amount of absolute crap we'd accumulated in the last 20 years.  Not just our own crap, but stuff left behind by both sets of our grandparents that we thought we couldn't part with, but now realize we don't need, and no one wants.

Our lesson, now that we're trying to keep only the things we need and will use, is that we are living in an era of unprecedented availability of cheap goods we think we need to fill a space and are tempted to accumulate.  Some of it, for us, is the influence of our Great Depression era grandparents' and their tendency to never throw anything away, some of it is the influence of the modern world around us.

Either way, we learned our lesson.  We don't want our kids to have to try to figure out what to do with our own stuff 20, or 30 years down the road.  We don't want to try to keep and store and clean and maintain 'shit we'll never use' anymore.  We don't want a bunch of useless crap to display and keep dusted.

We're done.  We're over it.

We may not be going to a hard core minimalist style of living as I know some people here strive to achieve, but it's a helluva big step for us to go from clutter to *functional and easy to clean*.

I hope we never fall into that trap, ever again.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have a livestock trailer full of crap to try to figure out what to do with....

ETA: Judging from just how. much. crap. both Goodwills already had - we're not alone in trying to pare down the sheer volume of 'stuff'.  As a secondary thought I wonder just how many other people have figured out they don't need it all, and are trying to get it out of their lives?",minimalism,1680443692.0
"I live in a grandma style house. Yes, I'm a minimalist.","Edit: I had no idea this post would blow up. Today was my grandmother's funeral, and as I'm checking the following afternoon, my family is going through all the old drawers of items and pictures. It's pretty cool. Thank you all SO much for your kindness in this thread. 

&#x200B;

This post was inspired by another post a few days ago called,[""why is minimalism so white?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/nv4fuj/why_is_minimalism_so_white_and_where_can_i_find/)

I played house swap with my grandmother when I graduated college. She passed away last week, but for the last three years I've been living at her house, while she moved in with my parents. I grew my business here, had relationships here, lived a life near a major city. This has been home.

But the carpets are pink. There is flower pot patterned wallpaper in the kitchen. The stove is from the 60s (brown, and VERY cool I might add). This is not a minimalists house, yet I am a minimalist.

Over the years, I've decluttered this place. Removing junk - junk I was allowed to remove because it was nothing but junk. I threw out 13 trash bags of complete garbage from this house. I took all the photos covering the surfaces and put them neatly in a closet i did not use.

This house because pristine. When my parents would come visit, my dad who grew up here was astonished and said, ""I never knew how big this place was with all the shit that was everywhere.""

I was in a relationship with a girl who would really mock the fact that I was living here. She was pretty judgey, but made it known she did not like spending time here. It made me super self conscious about it, and embarrassed to talk about it. It is a privilege to be where I am.

After that relationship ended, I met another girl, and as always when I tell knew people I kinda prepare for cringe... this person said to me, ""Pink carpets!? That should be more popular. That's such a vibe.""

I felt like I could really breathe and be myself having been accepted by this. The purpose of this post was to say, you can be a minimalist, and not have ikea furniture. I have pink carpets, but every surface of this 3br house is completely cleared. Minus two photo books (One I shot, one my friend shot), one surface with my plants, and another surface with my knife rack. Every other surface is completely clean, and I can fit all my worldly possessions in the trunk of my sedan. I'm proud of where I spent three years, and wanted to share.",minimalism,1623636749.0

Minimalism allowed me to save my cat's life,"My cat recently got very sick - one minute he was fine, we were playing, and all was okay. An hour later he was hiding in the closet, and had vomited far more liquid than I knew he could have in his body: leading to me rushing him to the ER. He is okay now, he is resting at home, and I have never been more grateful for anything in my life. On a smaller note, I am also grateful to minimalism - I don't know if I could've helped him otherwise.

1) I took a work-from-home job for a small paycut in the interest of minimalizing my worklife, so I was here when he got sick. At my prior job I wouldn't have been home for another 8 hours - I don't think he could've lasted another 8 hours.

2) We own very little excess, and the excess is hidden behind closed doors where he cannot get to them. Not having this excess made it easy to rule out injesting any poisonous objects, plastic, or sharp objects: leading to the vet knowing what to look for.

3) I'm fairly anti-consumption. Because of this I repair what I can, and buy as little as I can - taking stuff back when I slip up. This leads to thousands of dollars saved over the last couple years which I kept in my saving account. These savings were enough to pay for his sudden several thousand dollar surgery.

4) I have little value attached to what excess I have in my home, and so while he was having surgery and recovering at the hospital I pulled it all out, and listed it on various selling apps. This will help me begin to rebuild my savings. The items belonging to my fantasy self? Gone. The items belonging to my past self but have no relevance to me now? Gone. Random decor that is ""ok"" but not great? Gone. The old laptop I keep ""just in case"" my current, new one dies? Gone.
5. I see money as a tool now, not something with inherent value. There was no question about whether or not I'd pay to help my boy- I had the savings, I have a stable income, why wouldn't I? There is no pain from the money gone, because money is just a tool. There is just gratitude that I had the right tools to bring my boy home.

How many of you use Minimalism as a sort of ‘opting out’ of a severely sick society?,"  I’m a 29 year old male who works in a factory. It’s a union gig, pays decent, I’m single, no kids, no wife, no home, just a little mini studio apartment that provides for all my needs. I get by. 
  I started practicing minimalism almost before I even knew what it was exactly (though from one minimalist to another, the definition and how it’s applied will vary) by simply reading more books on philosophy and questioning life more deeply in my early 20s.
  At some point, I just kind of realized there is almost nothing truly needed that money get you outside of food, shelter, a vehicle, and some of the basics of modern life like internet, phone, etc.
  I realized that money (to me) is useful only in such that it gives one freedom to do what they want when they want, essentially to not be a slave. Over the years I have just completely opted out of buying much of anything except for the necessities (food is my guilty splurge I guess). 
  I realized the probability of me being rich isn’t very high, but I can feel rich if my expenses are extremely low, or so low to the point where it isn’t effecting my quality of life too much.
  I wear plain fitted black t shirts that I buy by the dozen, they look great and can be worn casually or in the gym. I have like 1 good paid of sneakers and a pair of boots, and a few pairs of slim fitted black jeans. Basically just rotate through these.
  I wonder how many people found minimalism and the lifestyle of simplicity as a way to healthily cope with the current climate of the modern world?
  I recently read a book on people who live to be 100 and what their lifestyles are like in Japan vs USA, and they are VERY simplistic, very true to our roots as a species. Tight communities, not overeating, daily movement and time in nature, not overworked or over stressed by work. To me, looking at our ancestors as traveling bands of hunter gatherers I ask myself what more do I really need materially, or that money can buy, if for millions of years our ancestors lived out happy fulfilling lifes in one form or another without almost owning a thing, unless they could carry it.
  I’m really trying to cultivate that lifestyle and mindset of gratitude without comparing my way of living to the average modern man because I believe it is our natural way of living. Unfortunately it does feel isolating and I do feel the pressure to do and be more though I don’t believe that this is natural but rather a cultural conditioning to keep consuming and pursuing endless growth despite its futility.
  I have a bed, a hot shower, a roof over my head in a safe area, I can control the temperature - materially, what else does one require? I don’t want to keep “upgrading” my lifestyle while chasing more money which inevitably leads to more stress and not much more happiness, though, like I said, I do feel isolated at times..",minimalism,1665938676.0
I’m over buying gifts to be thrown away or donated.,"Update - I am done with my shopping and this is a few things I did for loved ones. 

- Universal Yum subscription with a paper map for friends with middle age kids. For 6 months they will get snacks from different regions and they can find it on the map as they try them.

- 3 month subscription to Atlas Coffee. They will receive 3 bags of coffee sustainably grown with info from the farm they received it from.

-6 month subscription to Harry’s Razors. They will get two shipments of their preferred razors and shaving cream in that time.

- I set up 7 college funds total that will automatically have $10 put in a month. Each child gets a card at Christmas letting them know they had $120 put into their accounts with the statement of how it grew. It was very scary reaching out to a few close friends who didn’t have college funds set up, but it was loved by everyone and they helped me with the information to legally set it up in their child’s name. 

-Air B&B rental for my in-laws to take a trip with us (within 2 hours of their house so it’s not a chore or they have to pay for flights/etc). We will spend the day hiking some paths and wrote out a card detailing the trip. 


——————————————————————

I decided I’m done. 

I always come home a few weeks before Holidays and we do “Fakes-giving & Early Christmas” 

I made a visit to my sister with my 3 amazing nieces. We have a large family that gifts kids during the holidays -  the kids have everything they can need or want toys and clothing wise - and it’s all so overwhelming. The kids don’t even play with most of it - it’s just piled up everywhere. 

My other sister is begging my family to stop bringing her “family heirlooms” - and they just won’t. I finally got her to admit that it stresses her out and we put anything she didn’t want in a bin and took a picture to offer the other family members. 

My extended family throws nothing away and “collects” everything - beanie babies, DVDs, lighters, cards, spoons… everything. I can only imagine how different their retirements would be if they put that money into investing. 

Gifting in America has become insane. So I’m changing my ways. 

What I did to change: 
- I made college funds for each of my nieces, they get a monthly amount put in that is “gifted” all at once at birthdays and Christmas. Breaks up the expense as well! 

- Took my sister to the store and told her she could fill the cart with household items and groceries for her and her husbands Christmas present. Laundry soap, paper towel, toilet paper, groceries, etc. She loved it! 

-Got my family to agree to a Christmas trip to see each other instead of exchanging gifts! Memories over plastic!

- Nephews go to Disney yearly with their parents so we get gift cards to offset the cost of their tickets or use for a meal/character dinings. 

I really hope this catches on to other family members!

Multiple days of clearing out my grandparents apartment has given me renewed belief in the value of minimising.,"
I don’t know what I wanted to discuss with this post, I think I just needed a place to record my jumble of thoughts from an emotional week.  

My sole remaining grandparent (late 90s) has gone into the kind of care you don’t come home from. Two aunts, an uncle, my mother and myself just spent days upon days sorting and clearing out their two bedroom apartment. 

It’d been clear for sometime that they had more stuff than they could manage, but they wouldn’t allow anyone to even start helping. 

A few things stand out: 

24 big black trash bags of un-donateable clothes. Stained, worn, torn, mouldy, or all of the above. 

Enough Tupperware/plastic containers to service a family of 8. They lived alone and barely cooked. 

6 whisks and 4-5 of multiple other utensils. 

Shoes. So many shoes. I lost count after 50. Many stored in places that were beyond their reach and some I know they haven’t worn since before retirement 30 years previous. Maybe 4 pairs were able to be donated. 

Piles of broken items waiting to be fixed/mended/repurposed. They never got around to any of it - why would they when they already had multiple others of the same thing? But if anyone tried tossing the unusable items it was as if you’d suggested stealing the Crown Jewels. 

It was both sad and frustrating at the same time. For the first day it was difficult moving around because of boxes and bags. So many originally nice things that were beyond salvation because they’d been forgotten about in the back of a crammed full drawer or cupboard. 

As a result of this experience, I’ve started the new year freshly motivated to continue practicing mindfulness and minimalism with stuff. 

I’ve made good progress in the past but envisaging how many plastic bags would be needed to pack up my place and estimating how much of my stuff would realistically go in the trash… well I’ve still got a long way to go. Time to roll the sleeves up and have at it!

I’ve also instigated a ‘no-buy’ year for 2023 - when something runs/wears out, I’m determined to really look at what I already own and to use alternatives instead of instantly getting something new. 

I’d like to think I’ll be posting a success story on Dec 31st, but at the very least I think it will be one of progress. 

Wishing everyone here all the best for 2023, and thanks to the community as a whole for being a place of support.",minimalism,1672649840.0
"Just sold my car, paid off one credit card, and my phone payment. Feels absolutely amazing.","I used to pay 100 dollars a month for insurance, ~200 for gas, 41 for my iPhone , and had a credit card with over 1000 dollars and today marks the day where all those payments are gone for good.

Smugness here is at an all-time high.,"I've been on the sub a while, and I haven't yet seen many posts bashing non-minimalists. But for the past couple of weeks I've seen several.

Your minimalism is a path to make you happy. It is not a way for you to feel superior to others. Also, let's not pretend that we ""Don't understand"" people who believe that they get joy from owning and buying things. Almost none of us were born minimalists, so at some point we all were that way too.

If part of the point of this is to help you clear your mind and develop a more internal sense of peace, why are you filling your head with judgments and concerning yourself with the decisions of others?",minimalism,1632403179.0

"Minimalism should not be a contest of who has less, but a philosophy of less.","Hi everyone.

I have been on this subreddit for a while and I would like to bring up what minimalism means to me. I have read many posts about how some people have only 2 T-shirts and 5 pairs of socks. As I was reading this while looking into by wardrobe with much more T-shirts and socks I felt guilty for not being minimal enough. Then I realized it is not about ""who can survive on less"" , but rather to feel comfortable. I do laundry every approx. 2 weeks. If I would have less clothes I would need to do it much more often, which would lead to stressful situations and a lot of planning. Then I realized that for me, minimalism is not only about minimizing the number of stuff, but also about minimizing the amount of willpower and time spent on planning. This applies also to dishes: I used to live in a small flat where I had only 4 plates for 2 people. This is lovely, until you realize you can not use the dishwasher because of obvious reasons.......

So I would like to tell you that it is okay to have more stuff if that brings you less stressful situations and less planning for optimization with too little stuff. The threshold for this trade-off is different for everyone (e.g. if you are used to eat lunch at work and dinner outside, you do not need as much dishes as a person who cooks everything everyday). And also to think about the situations if something brokes, how fast do you need to replace it? If it can wait, then no problem to have less of such stuff. But if you will need it immediately and you would be forced to stand up and go to the store now, it might be very inconvinient. In this sense, I want to *minimize time spent about thinking and optimizing situations to survive on the ""expense"" of having a bit more stuff.*

I just wanted to add my point of view and maybe ensure some people who just start to be minimalists, to think what it means for them, before they throw away too much. Don't get me wrong, I do not want to say that having just 2 T-shirts is incorrect, I just want to stress out to adjusting the concept to your specific situation and needs, not just throw everything away because someone did so and is happy, so I have to be happy to. It is also okay to discuss points of view, ideas and give/take advice, just adapt it to yourself (as with everything in life...).

To sum up, I believe that the core idea of minimalism was to *de-clutter your life and make it more simple. Do not add complexity by pushing for the other extreme: of having too little. The idea which we want to optimize should be to minimize complexity, maximize utility and happiness by simplifying things*, whatever that means for you.

Have a lovely day and think for yourself :)",minimalism,1622370595.0
Unpopular opinion: I do NOT hate the minimalists,"After reading about 80 times in this sub that the minimalists suck and the second documentary is also garbage, that Joshua is kind of arrogant, and so much more, I gave it a lot of thought. But I found out, I still like them.

You guys are right about them making and selling themselves as a brand in a way, but that's how you generate reach isn't it? In a perfect society this might not be necessary, but in ours it is. And the more people they reach with minimalism, the better (how ironic). I don't think their marketing is over the top though, for example I didn't even know they sold merch until I read about it in this sub.

I would never have found minimalism without them. 

And if you, as experienced minimalists, think they're repetitive and you're no longer getting value from it, then just stop listening to their podcast, maybe just for a while. But is that a reason to hate them? 

Personally, I don't think it's that bad, because it keeps me on track. I also found the second documentary actually enjoyable to watch, I only got a negative feeling when I read your opinions in this sub.

Sure the hugging without asking is weird, sure in parts they suggest methods that are out of the question for me personally, etc. But we can all think.

I was addicted to shopping. I only identified myself by the things I owned. I wore designer clothes, always had to have the latest iPhone and a TV for thousands of dollars. Even my water had to come from a ""cool"" brand. And much more. All that while having debt.

Normalize doing less: the Anti-New Years Resolution,"Most New Years Resolutions are all about adding things to you plate, buying stuff, and working more; going to the gym, eating better, writing that great American novel...

Even when you are technically removing things from your life (like drinking less), it's constructed in our minds to be more work. All this added effort in our already overwhelmed lives is setting us up for failure.

So if you are going to do a resolution this year: do less.

Let's go back to the Less Drinking example. Yes, it's doing less. But it's written in a way that makes it active. You are thinking of it as working to stop something. Instead maybe try something like, ""I'm done with the partying time in my life"" or ""I'm done going to clubs and wasting money"" 

I know this isn't perfect in every example. But look at the trope about Going to the Gym. Most people will fail within the month, because they are just adding another goddamn thing to do each day. It's also too big and undefinable.

So what then can you take out of your life, that would allow you to have the mental and physical bandwidth to go to a gym? Start there.

Did anyone else arrive at minimalism through environmentalism? And vice versa anti-consumerism?,"Seeing the way we plunder and pollute our planet made me not want to be a part of it and take an active role in stopping it. That led me to having fewer items overall and stopping my pleasure purchasing. Stopping impulse buying led me to view consumerism and capitalism (in the Western sense) as something quite unwise and arguably delusional. Not being driven to buy material goods has led me to not really seeing the futility in working for high net worth. Not being driven to work long hours for lots of money has led me into FIRE (financial independence retire early). 

All of this, where I’ve ended up, is so far away from the society I was raised in and what I was taught to value. And what I was taught “success” is. Most people I meet can’t understand that I’m not driven by money. I know that money wouldn’t make me happier because I’m already financially stable and I wouldn’t feel good about myself just buying more things and contributing to the destruction of our planet.

Watching people pretend to be rich is so embarassing,"So much of consumerism is just people pretending to be richer than they are. It's sad that they feel pressured to, and that's its own topic, but at the same time watching someone spend their entire covid relief cheque on a Gucci purse just gives me such strong secondhand embarrassment. There are ENTIRE BRANDS that seem to be dedicated to this.

Take Guess for example - purses with big fat logos telling everyone that you own a Guess bag, stores that make you feel the way you *imagine you'd feel* if you were richer than you actually are for a brief moment. Staff wearing suits, treating you like gold, walking around the counter to grace you with your bag after purchase. Ohh la la. I don't think I've ever seen a single wealthy (or even slightly above average income) person walk around with The Big G, and yet every single person ever who has proudly strutted around with a Guess bag seemed to genuinely believe that they've fooled everyone else into thinking their last name is Gates. I have nothing personally against these people but I just cringe so hard when I see someone with a t-shirt that looks like Gap but says ""Gucci"" in really worn-out print, or carrying a purse that probably cost them more than the car they're driving it around in.

Minimalists aren't immune to this - for example there's a subset of people that almost seem to use minimalism as an excuse to buy every. single. apple. product. They mention ""my apple watch"" and display their macbooks on pictures as though it's the key to being minimalist yet also letting people know that they can afford a top of the line macbook with all the bells and whistles. Again, there's nothing wrong with anyone owning a macbook - I actually think apple products have some nice under-the-hood features that nobody else has - but watching people buy it because they think it will get them the same effect as wearing Gucci with the suave subtly of ""rejecting consumerism"" is just too much.

"Instead of immediately buying online, add the item to a list that you review end of the month to reduce impulsive purchases","Between autofill, free shipping, PayPal, one-step checkout, and more friction reducing services, it’s easier and faster than ever to purchase items online. You don’t even have to pull out your credit card or type in your name and address. Keep in mind that websites are designed by a team of coders, data scientists, designers, and psychologists to entice you to fulfill the transaction immediately. This leads to a lot of unnecessary purchases that clutter your home, reduce your bank account, and add minimal value to your life.

Instead of purchasing an item you want, create a wishlist on your phone of items you think you need or want. You can add anything to it: clothing, household items, etc. When you feel the desire to acquire the item, add it to the list rather than the shopping cart.

At the end of each month, you’re allowed to buy any and everything review your list: no restrictions whatsoever.

What you’ll likely find is that most items in the list are no longer desirable, thus reducing clutter and unnecessary spending. This has been extremely helpful in both my minimalism journey and building up greater discipline around consumption.",minimalism,1670486331.0
How going blind turned me into a minimalist - the obstical is the way,"Hey guys!  I have a sorta weird journey I’d like to share.  

I learned in middle school that I was slowly going to go blind.  At the time I didn’t quite comprehend how that would change my life.   All I knew is my work life would be short.  

I started trying to make as much money as possible. I was terrified!  Felt like an impossible challenge.  

At age 23 as my eyes got worse  i sold my car and I started car pooling into work.  What a huge cost savings!  

I turned my license in at 26 (wasn’t really using it anyway)

As I lost more vision it got harder to play golf, play video games, mow the yard, clean a big house, ride a bike, etc.  all things I no longer need to buy.  Meanwhile I was still working saving as much as I could.  

Eventually I had to get the white cane, and I started running into more things... things I didn’t need.  The potted indoor tree, bulky entertainment stand, stuff in the garage I never used.  So I got rid of it!  

Then the day came... I needed to retire. My eyes had gotten to the point I couldn’t work.  I was way beyond legally blind.  I was 33

After a month I realized I lived in a high cost of living area for no reason, so I moved to an area that costs 1/2 as much bought a house and never looked back.  

I share my story because I feel like the luckiest person.  Going blind forced me to make so many hard decisions that many would think was crazy but ultimately open so many doors of opportunity like retiring early.  

I’m not a perfect minimalist but I can say it has changed my life!

Don't Let Reddit Kill 3rd Party Apps! /r/minimalism will be going dark from 12th June,"**What's going on?**

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app permanently inaccessible to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from Apollo to Reddit is Fun to Narwhal to BaconReader.

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface .

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

**What's the plan?**

On June 12th, many subreddits will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because we love Reddit, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.

The two-day blackout isn't the goal, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.

**What can you do?**

1. Complain. Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a support request: comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as this one, leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.
2. Spread the word. Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at /r/ModCoord.
3. Boycott and spread the word...to Reddit's competition! Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite non-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!
4. Don't be a jerk. As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.

Minimalism taught me to be picky with what clothes I buy and never before have I received more compliments for my style.,"Title. I have made it my goal to only buy an item when I am absolutely sure that I will enjoy wearing it. I'm reminding myself to be picky - only clothes from comfortable, season appropriate materials that fit me well and are compatible with the rest of my wardrobe are considered.

I admit, the regular endorphins from making a new purchase are gone, because I return items more frequently now. Instead, I feel empowered because I know that ""good enough"" won't make me happy in the long run. Every item that I choose feels extra special.

"After 20 years as a minimalist, I’m shifting to an essentialism.","I’ve loved being a minimalist. It’s been especially helpful being an expat for the past 10 years. 

I got married this year and just started a year-long global backpacking journey with my wife. 

My wife is not a minimalist. As we started preparing for our trip, I found communicating minimalism somewhat difficult. 

As we packed, I started asking my wife, “is this essential?” I found that this question opened and personalized minimalist concepts, which also made it easier to understand. 

At times, I’ve found minimalism to be challenging for others to accept as it can come across as extreme and some can feel judged. However, as I consider what’s essential to each individual, I’ve found a gentle way to move others in a direction that accepts and appreciates their individual needs and preferences. 

I want to encourage more people to lighten the loads in their lives. I believe this slight label change can open even more conversations while providing a super simple framework to follow.

On the bizarre way I’ve seen people relate to minimalism around the sub,"It’s a minority of the people here to be sure, but is anybody else perplexed by questions of “if I do or have X, can I still be **a minimalist**”, or “does (common human value) matter to minimalists”? Or the guy asking “is minimalism a life value” when the central issue is that he doesn’t support his wife and appears to fiercely and maybe even selfishly segment what are “his” duties at home?

I just want to remind people that minimalism isn’t a religion, or a club, or an identity. If being *”A Minimalist” (as opposed to just “trying to be minimalist”, or “taking a minimalist approach”) is helpful to you, then sure, consider yourself A Minimalist.

But in the end, minimalism is just a tool that helps *you*. There aren’t any rules, nobody’s going to take away your minimalist card because you have a plushy collection you earnestly enjoy, or have more shoes than the average person.

Minimalism is just asking do you need those things, or would you be happier and more more contented if you had the space instead? What are you holding onto just because of feelings of emotional obligation that you might not have recognised before? Are you spending responsibly on your hobbies/interests, or are you bringing yourself to struggle? Is forever upgrading your shit filling (or failing to fill) a void in your life? Does the stuff in your home, bag, work desk fill a purpose or spark joy, or does it only contribute clutter to your mental space as well as your physical space?

Minimalism is about a more mindful, more fulfilled you, or else what’s the point in it? I know for a lot of us trying to be minimalist ties with anti-consumption, which might also be linked to saving money or lessening our environmental impacts by buying less. Even still, minimalism is just a tool to help you consider these things.

I don’t make this post to shade anyone (except maybe *dressing-up-my-relationship-issues-as-“arent-I-a-good-minimalist”* guy…I side-eye you, dude) but if you get hung up about doing minimalism “the right way” or hitting a certain “standard” of minimalism, then you’ve already defeated the purpose because minimalism has just become another source of junk and worry in your life.

Decide Once,"SO was reading a book recently called The Lazy Genius and one of the principles is called Decide Once.

They are my very favorite.  I now know that I don't buy anything other type of PJs.  When I catch myself mindlessly browsing at Target I can tell myself.  ""I've already decided I wear Hello Mello pajamas"" and there is no need to shop further.  Another examples is scrubs I have one specific type and brand I wear and when I ruined one by spilling bleach on it I knew exactly what to do.  Ordered another identical pair online because I've already decided one scrubs that work for me.  You get the idea....same for hand soap.  My days i spend at home always involve a long shirt with leggings...add a cardigan if it's cold. No pause about what to wear because I've decided. I've also decided I LOVE candles that bring my joy.  Anytime people ask for gift ideas I always say candles.  No pause or having to think through gift ideas and I always say candles.  This may sound boring to some but it really brings order to my life and is really the essence of minimalism for me",minimalism,1617141832.0
I think minimalism is going to get really popular and capitalism is going to have to adjust for it.,"Long read, but you might like it!

Tiny homes, container homes, van dwelling, off-gridding, homesteading, minimalism, over-landing, seasonal work, etc.

All of these things are getting more and more popular, communities for these sorts of things are growing a lot more than past years.

I think Covid really opened people’s eyes to how callous and indifferent capitalism really is to the world and the workers who keep it afloat.

Companies don’t care about you. If you quit your job you would be replaced quickly.

Couple that fact with the idea of “What exactly are you working for?”

To have a roof under your head, food to eat, money to pay for bills, debt, spouse, children, etc?

Why exactly does that require 40-60+ hour work weeks for a lot of people?


A lot of it has to do with consumerism and the idea that there is never enough. You’re not meant to live within your means and maintain your lifestyle, you’re meant to grow your lifestyle, gain more and more.

And that leads to entrapment.

Despite what your income is: 20k, 50k, 80k, 100k, 500k, 1000k a year.

The system is designed to entrap you.

Majority of people buy houses on 15-30 year fixed mortgage rates.

That is 15-30 YEARS of your time, energy, and money paying that off.

Can you comprehend that? 

That means by the time you buy your first house in say your late 20s you would already be close to if not middle-aged by the time you pay it off.

It’s all about entrapment,

What can society do to make you consistently abide and profit the system?

It can push the narrative of marrying and having kids which equates to a life long commitment of providing for that family which in turn equates to profiting the system. 
(No offense to those that have kids, but this is true.)

It can push things like the “college standard”, which funnels people into debt and jobs that require specific skill sets, but almost all profit big companies like tech, healthcare industry, and business.

Making “big money”, but entrapping workers and almost making it mandatory to live certain lifestyles because you have a certain profession. Think doctor or lawyer and nice cars and houses.

But another key component to this is the fact that trade or vocational schooling is severely undermined and thought of as “shop class” people careers.

But in reality provide hands on training and education at an immensely cheaper price than college with guaranteed work upon completion.

I’ve also noticed that practical skills like building a house, fixing plumbing, fixing your car, etc, are not often enough valued in the education system, especially colleges.

And I believe there is a reason for that.

This is all subjective of course, but hear me out.

I’ve worked in a few trades for the majority of my life, and the one thing I’ve noticed about any expensive place I’ve worked at, whether it be some wealthy family or business man’s 5 star rental on the coast, they all shared the same thing.

They have no practical skills. All their time and work is dedicated to their college learned skillset. They will have 5 different contractors working on their house doing 5 different things. Fixing leaks, adding a bedroom, cutting their lawn, etc.

I think colleges and the education system does this on purpose, because it keeps people less independent and less inclined to not follow the system.

If they just pay for services instead of doing it themselves, that keeps money flowing, that keeps them within the system.

Schools don’t teach kids how to manage money properly, do their taxes, how loans work, etc.

People learn that when they’re out on their own and a lot of the time they get cheated with a high interest rate loan or something where they didn’t know better, but that’s what society wants.

The second a person learns how to build their own house, fix their own car, manage money wisely, be self motivated, etc they become extremely dangerous to the system. That’s exactly why I think entrepreneurship is heavily frowned upon and thought of as a unobtainable dream.

If everyone was like that the system of capitalism would not work.

But now we dive into the big game changer.

Minimalism.

Now more and more people are realizing that you can play along with the system’s rules and still manage to break free from entrapment.

By eliminating things like expensive houses, cars, eating habits, spending habits, etc…

You greatly minimize the time it takes to reach the level of financial independence.

People work and live in vans saving enough money to just travel for a year and go back to work when necessary.

People live at home with their parents and save bundles upon bundles of money until they can move out and buy some off grid cabin or tiny home completely paid off.

People hop from state to state or country to country doing seasonal work for free housing and experience.

Now more than ever we are seeing people combat the system, and it’s only getting bigger and bigger every day.

A lot of it has to do with people realizing that consumerism really isn’t a healthy standard of living and they would rather live modestly to enrich themselves in experiences and things they want to do.

Another part of it is people have no choice and have to do these things because everything is so expensive right now.

Regardless I hope people understand that in the end minimalism is going to change the world.

People and companies can talk about global warming and going green and all of that as much as they want, but the real problem is at the heart of capitalism.

We consume and waste far more than we need to, couple that with the world population increasing dramatically everyday and that’s why the world is the way it is.

The less people want and the less they spend leads to deflation.

Which leads to companies polluting less, manufacturing and wasting less, and ultimately restructuring their outlook on marketing and profit.

I think this all is coming sooner than we may think.

I think when people realize that being rich and owning more and more just leads to more entrapment, they’re going to value financial independence and their own desires a lot more.

Minimalism will change the world, whether we choose to or capitalism leads us so far down that it’s coming whether people like it or not.",minimalism,1630190483.0
Tip: put stuff away,"In addition to getting rid of stuff, a practice I'm developing and enjoying is to put stuff away. 

Started with clothes - they don't get tossed on the bed or the back of a chair, they go in the closet. Shoes don't get left by the door, they go into the closet. Earbuds don't go on the bedside table, they go in the drawer.

Now applying it to everything else. Every thing has a place (if not then make one, or get rid of it). So put it in its place.",minimalism,1613511375.0

Anyone else benefited from a year in quarantine?,"*Edit: OF COURSE there are many tragedies surrounding this virus and everything else going on in the world today. I have suffered too. This post is about one tiny positive thing that is happening.*

Just want to celebrate a little... I just found out that my job is going to stay almost completely remote post-COVID. I've been hanging on to a lot of my work clothes this past year, in anticipation (and dread) of probably going back to work someday. I've loved working from home but didn't want to get too attached. Now I think I'm ready to clear out half my closet! I can fully embrace the WFH lifestyle (which I think is more forgiving of wearing the same couple shirts over and over).

"""You Live In a Tiny Apartment.""","recently I needed a cable from IT to do remote work. When they asked how long I said ""My apartment is about as big as this room."" (The office we were in) and the person said ""You live in a tiny apartment."" 

I've been mulling that comment over and over in my head. Yes, I do live in a tiny apartment. And its wonderful. And it saves me hundreds of dollars each month. And I don't feel compelled to fill it with stuff. And it is quick to clean. And I can save huge percentage of my income for things that matter to me more than having two bathrooms. And the location is more convenient for someone who uses public transit than the suburbs. 

I feel as a minimalist we will sometimes get this ridicule. But it's important to remember that most people are on autopilot. Buying into the myth that more is better without realizing it's not always true. It's hard to go against the crowd  sometimes but it's vital to live a life true to your values.

Edit: thank you for your supportive comments. I see now I was a little too quick to assume ridicule. I just felt defensive. I appreciate your help correcting my mindset. I really do love my small apartment and it works for me, not that it works for everyone. I don't feel that I'm superior to anyone! I'm just different than the cultural narrative that is currently the norm and going with or against the group is always a source of conflict. I'm sure smarter people than I have articulated this point better.",minimalism,1622304006.0
Minimalism isn’t about having less,"Just heard a quote by TK Coleman you all might enjoy.

“Minimalism isn’t about having less. It’s about having a balanced relationship between more and less. Having less of the things that hold you back  and  weigh you down and having more of the things that create space for possibility and joy.”

With all of the “how many is too many” posts or “can I own X and still be a minimalist” I thought this was fitting. At the end of the day someone will own less than you or think you own too much but we have to remember we are doing this for US. No rules but your rules",minimalism,1664378370.0
Why is minimalism so white?

Is there any place i can find less blank white minimalism? Something either more colorful or like any other aesthetic besides ""i live in a white box""?

[Spoiler] Netflix’s Less is Now - The Minimalists,"I’ve just finished watching the second edition of Ryan and Joshua’s adventure (let’s put Ryan First for once, just to pretend he is not accessory to the immense ego of Joshua). 

I didn’t like it. I’m not the one to bash, as I loved the first one and it has been so important for my journey. But I didn’t like this second shot one bit. 

First of all, why? If we are on a journey to keep only what ADDS VALUE, why coming out with a second documentary repeating the same sentences over and over again? Well, unless it is to add value to their bank accounts...

By now we knew their personal stories and we knew about the consumer market and the benefit of minimalism just by watching the first documentary, so why another one? 
LESS IS MORE, let’s start applying the concept by not duplicating!

Matt D’Avella direction is good as it was on the first occasion, with shots along the lines of modern documentaries although I personally didn’t like the music in most sequences.

The settings are as fake as it gets, ranging from a generic house to declutter to, and it’s worse, a studio decorated with mass-consumer-minimalistic-IKEA-like forniture.

The worst part for me was the overacting, especially from Joshua; it was awkward at times feeling like I was watching an audition for a high school play. 

I appreciate the effort and the theme is certainly important to me, but if there is nothing new to say maybe it would be better to say nothing at all. 
Or is this documentary another example of the readily-available consumerism?

Moving houses really is really enlightening in seeing how much stuff one has,"Me and my partner are moving to a different apartment, and as we're actively trying to downsize our possessions, we decided to go through everything we own and let go of everything we don't use. A while ago, we decided to go through the kitchen cupboards. We deliberately let the dishes pile up before this - as those things would obviously be things that we regularly use - and simply emptied out the entire cupboards.

 We established rules before starting to go through the things - everything that hadn't been used once since our last move had to go. Things that have only been used once are spared if either of us can name the exact time, place or situation *when* we will need them. And if there's a spare of something we already *do* use, we'll pick whichever one is in better condition, used more, or simply prettier, and donate the one that we like less.

 And let me tell you, our cupboards are *empty*. Why in the world would *two* people need *four* frying pans? Why were we still using the broken cutting board when we have three whole ones?

Do they hold on to stuff longer because they have the space?   Also, how many legs do these people have to require 20 pairs of jeans?   Are they centipedes?

My mom took us on a shopping spree and I walked away with nothing,"I 31F have two sisters. They and my mom came to visit over Christmas and wanted to go to two specific stores that were having sales. I had fun driving them there and showing them the city. 

At each store, my mom said she would buy us anything we wanted, no limit. My sisters went insane. One of them got three pairs of shoes. They had to have spent close to a grand between the two of them. 

I walked away with literally nothing. My mom kept asking if I saw anything I wanted, kept pointing things out I might like, and I kept saying no thank you. 

The thing is, I wasn’t even being super disciplined about it. I truly did not want anything. I would have felt worse buying something and going home to put it in my closet than to just walk out empty handed. I feel like minimalism is really becoming easy for me. The thought of coming home with the amount of stuff my sisters got makes me nauseous. And the fact someone offers to get me anything I want for free and I can happily say no makes me feel like a successful minimalist.

EDIT: I made a well-thought-out Christmas list and my mom bought everything on it. She was thrilled to give, I was thrilled to receive. High dollar items. This shopping spree was an impulsive decision, once we got to the store and realized there was a big sale. My family is such a sucker for sales. They buy stuff they don’t need, because it’s on sale or a really good deal. We had a stackable discount at one store that got us like 75% off. I promise I let my mom buy me things, I just didn’t want to take part in the impulsive stockpiling.

Why do some of you act like getting gifts is a crime against you?,"For real, some of you act like you’re constantly barraged with gifts; living out your own personal story of Sisyphus. Seems to be a spike in ""how do I deal with gifts"" posts. Being minimalist doesn’t mean you’re minimal about solutions. 

1. Sell it. Maybe on Facebook Marketplace (they have a “don’t let friends see” option). Or Ebay. 

2. Re-gift it. Congrats, now you don’t have to shop. Or now you have emergency gifts you can dip into. Or maybe there’s someone you know that could actually use it. Join your local Facebook ""buy nothing"" group.

3. Curb it. Write ""free"" and let it magically disappear in front of your house. This is closest step to the final option. IMO, best of all worlds. Someone gets to use it and it's the least effort. No posting on Facebook or letting it sit in your home waiting to be re-gifted.

4. The nuclear option: throw it away. I get it, options 1 and 2 (and 3 if you're paraplegic) can be exhausting and not worth the effort. I don't like killing sea turtles anymore than you but it can either be trash in your home or be trash in the landfill.

So what if you keep getting gifts you don’t want? Maybe your parents or friends keep giving you physical items? Well, as an adult, you can…

3. Tell them *exactly* what you want. It might take time to get it into their heads but keep telling them exactly what you want. One story: a couple told their parents to stop giving them physical gifts and give them the gift of babysitting. In other words, the grandparents would babysit their grandkids as a gift.

4. And if you keep getting physical gifts you don’t want (like you’re a vegan getting beef jerky all the time), just smile and accept it and use one the 4 solutions. I'm sure someone would happily scoop up free beef jerky on your local ""buy nothing"" group.

Some of you seem to be letting yourself fight this uphill battle which is not minimalist, I hope you realize. Humans like to give. It's in our nature. You can no more stop getting gifts than you can stop the weather.

And frankly, it's not only the physical gift but the emotional one, too. Someone took the effort to give you something because they care. Oh, the humanity.",minimalism,1685454931.0
DAE feel this sub is becoming a repetitive sub for self validation ?,"
Lately this sub feels like it’s been expanding in the
‘What should I do? /  is this minimalist? / is it ok to get rid of x ? 

Only you know what’s appropriate to yourself 

Be it 6 coats or 2 coats, if you need it or it’s used then keep it 

After practicing minimising for myself and my family It’s easy to fall into the trap of toxicity.

Someone who works from home in a 2 climate area, will require something completely different to someone who commutes and lives in 4 season area with micro climates when one day and the next can be completely different 

Someone might find joy in jackets, video games, books, art. It’s ok to keep that which brings you joy 

An objective view on minimalism is a breeding ground for toxicity. The minimalists are great for pointing people in the right direction, but comparing yourself to them in an effort to be more minimalist is not the way to go. 

Their business is selling people the idea of minimalism. It’s how they make their money.

Coming back on topic, if you feel like getting rid of if then you can put it away for a specified period of time and check back in future 

The worst case scenario for most items is that you can buy them again easily, quickly or find alternatives. 

Self motivation and self regulation is the only way to go 

There’s no right or wrong.

Perhaps a minimalist lifestyle and a minimalist subreddit is required,  

if that’s ok and would still be minimalist 😉

I hate cleaning but I desperately need things to be clean. Minimalism is the only answer.,"I used to be a shopping addict.

I always felt like I was ""that one perfect thing"" away from being normal. A good person. My perfect self.

But then I discovered minimalism a few years ago, and it truly changed my life. Maybe even saved my life. I recognize that, while I'm not a naturally clean person, I have to have things clean to be mentally stable. If my environment is messy, I slide into the worst version of myself in almost every aspect of my life: my health, my finances, my productivity, my habits, and my effectiveness at work and in my relationships. It all stems from my environment. 

But I don't like cleaning. I don't like scrubbing floors, and washing endless dishes, and dust, and always picking up clutter. So much clutter! 

The only solution, at least, for me, is minimalism. It's having as little as possible in order to live comfortably and not one item more. It's not keeping around a bunch of aspirational clothing and crafting supplies and junk that reflects who I *wish* to be, and not who I actually am. It's infinitely easier to keep a sparse house clean than it is to constantly be shuffling, jumbling, and managing endless piles and piles of *stuff.*

Been practising minimalism for 5 years and I’m regretting some of the things I did,"I regret throwing my vinyl records. I collected a lot of it pre-minimalism. But after reading about minimalism and reflecting on it, I made the decision to de clutter and sold everything away. It was a liberating experience. Along with other acts of minimalism, my life has been amazing since I made the change 5 years ago. I’ve stopped caring about what other people think, what the world wants me to be, and just fully focused on what matters to me. However, i don’t feel joy in some of the activities that i used to enjoy doing and I’m starting to understand what ‘value’ truly means for me. 

You see when I made the decision to sell all my vinyl records, the rationale was that listening to Spotify holds more ‘value’. It’s cheaper, I can listen to it anytime, anywhere and almost anything that I want. My vinyl records however was taking up too much space, some were collecting dust and I was spending too much money and effort into it. Once I cleared it all up, I have more space in my room, I stop thinking about which next record to buy and that gave me more attention to put into my work as a software engineer. 

All was good until this year, I realised that my relationship with music has changed. To me they all sound the same and the act of listening to music was ‘boring’. But how could this be? I had access to millions of music as compared to the 50 vinyl records I used to own, and I can listen to it anywhere and whenever I want. I should be happy, right? And that’s where the problem lies. Overabundance. In quantity and accessibility. In my attempt to make a more ‘minimalist’ choice, it backfired. I started listening to songs that I previously would never have chosen to listen too, simply because I’m bored and Spotify is recommending me to. 

I tried limiting my use of Spotify, and allowing myself
to only listen to music on a specific time block when I’m at home. But the experience isn’t the same, I hate having to use more willpower and attention to stop myself from listening to music during the day when it’s is easily accessible to me, be it Spotify or YouTube. 

And so with this I realised that minimalism is not just about throwing stuff away, it’s really about the value of your attention and where you’re putting it into. It’s possible to have a messy, uncluttered space as long as it gives you the value to fully focus on a particular activity that you enjoy.",minimalism,1632760412.0
[Venting] I hate when people try to pass the emotional burden of items onto me,"Honestly I really need to vent here... I just hate when they’re insistent on you accepting something you don’t need and make you feel bad when you say no because you have enough stuff and you don’t want their stuff that they themselves don’t want. I loosely follow minimalism buy I still have way too much stuff. I’ve inspired people around me to also declutter their things and thats great. I also know they’re just offering things out of love especially because my grandmother thinks since Im a student living on my own that Im out here sleeping on the floor and sitting on milk crates. 

But currently my grandmother is trying to convince me to take her ancient treadmill that I don’t have any space for (I live in a tiny town house with three roommates) and don’t need because I have a free membership to the gym through school. Not to mention I don’t think my roommates would appreciate me plopping a treadmill in the middle of the living room that would also be loud and annoying as hell for them. I love my grandmother but man if I say I don’t want it just let it be, if I took everything she offered me I would be driving an hour away to take carloads of stuff once a week! It’s literally almost everyday she’s trying to sell these donations like she’s a car salesman or something, it’s honestly starting to drive me crazy. She makes me feel like I’ve let her down somehow when I say I don’t need something and it’s mentally exhausting.

Edit: before you comment just take it and throw it out for the 78th time, just don’t. If you care I commented below why thats not an option and if you don’t care enough to read it please explain to me how I’m supposed to transport a treadmill in my little 2 door car its not as simple as taking it and tossing it",minimalism,1611094277.0
I think this subredsit is toxic.,"I do understand not wanting to own things that you do not need and even see the benefit one can get from that in many areas like mental health, finances, and time spent maintaining the things you own. 

However, I think some people here are taking it to a literal extreme and going beyond minimalism for the sake of the person into minimalism that compromises your own comfort. 

You can still be minimalistic:
1. If you possess tools that you definitely need for your necessary activities (like a desktop computer taking space at home). 
2. If you have some small and tasteful objects for decoration at home.
3. If you have stylish clothes. Just don't have an excessive amount of clothes. 
4. If you have objects that you get fun out of. (like a vamera for a hobby photographer).",minimalism,1679332564.0
Minimalism made me realise I dislike my tattoos.,"Now, hear me out. How did that happen, you may ask? 
When I first got into minimalism, I never even considered my tattoos as something that I would once regret getting. In fact, I never thought that would happen. Lately, however, I began to realise one thing. As I’m spending almost no time on Instagram or other social media beside Reddit , my desire for getting more tattoos is dwindling. I couldn’t find anything worth getting inked on my body anymore. I wasn’t getting any more input from outside and all my ideas seemed bland and unimportant. That made me question ... why was I getting tattoos in the first place ? 
You must know, by now I have two shoulder pieces connecting into a chest piece , a patchwork sleeve and a few pieces on my legs. I used to pride myself in calling myself a tattoo collector and getting new pieces on a whim. I would use these pieces to signal my interests to other people. 
Now, I’m starting to think I don’t want to do that anymore. I don’t feel the need to signal my belonging to a certain group to anyone anymore. It’s the same thing as wearing band merch or brand signs , only on a much more permanent scale. Or with fashion and style. My sheer interest in certain topics validated my belonging into those spaces. I don’t need ink on my skin to do that for me. 

My main issue now is that I wasn’t „done“ with what I had in mind. My arm still has gaps that’d need filling for me to be happy with the whole concept, the existing tattoos are good but not perfectly to my liking and my chest piece is unsymmetrical. It just feels very cluttered to me. 

Getting laser removal is not an option due to the darkness and amount of pieces. The only sensible option for me is to, at one point, cover it all up with large scale blackwork. I still really like tattoos so that isn’t an issue for me, but I do wish I hadn’t started getting them in the first place. 

On the one hand, it’s very freeing to break free from that persona that I so meticulously crafted for myself over all those years, but on the other hand it’s also scary. These pieces of art aren’t books or T-shirt’s that I can just toss out. 

I’m just writing this down to get it off my chest but I’d love to hear your thoughts.",minimalism,1616846030.0
The Minimalists unsubscribing people from email list,"Yesterday on Instagram The Minimalists had this lengthy post about unsubscribing anyone that had not opened emails from them in the past month.  Basically saying since you haven’t opened the email they were not adding value so they automatically unsubscribed.  Seems like they are doing this so you will open their emails.  Their first documentary is what got me into minimalism but now I can barely stand to listen to them.   😂 Not sure if anyone else saw this but was  wondering other people’s thoughts on this?  I had unfollowed them on Facebook and quit listening to the podcast, finally unfollowed on Instagram.",minimalism,1612795495.0
I don't need to own something to like it.,"I am decluttering in advance of moving, and I am repeating this mantra to myself. I liked reading Harry Potter as a child. I haven't touched the books in years.
  
I like dogs. I do not need every scrap of dog-patterned fabric or every kitchen magnet shaped like a dog to remember that I like dogs. 
  
I am trying to approach this as a ""what can I not possibly bear to part with"", as opposed to ""what do I dislike enough to get rid of"".
  
Do you a mantras or saying to keep a clear mind while evaluating your belongings? Something that cuts through the mud? It's hard to do this without getting bogged down.",minimalism,1666706887.0
You are not a failure as a minimalist if,"You have more than three shirts

You have a knickknack (or more than one knickknack!)

Your rooms aren’t empty

You enjoy colors

Your stuff doesn’t fit into a backpack


Sometimes I beat myself up because I still have non-essential belongings. It helps to remind myself that true minimalism isn’t the same as adhering to a minimalist aesthetic and that my minimalism is mine and that’s ok.",minimalism,1615404078.0
I finally deleted all my social media accounts as well as apps including Netflix.," I have struggled with my mental health for a long time and being on social media was not helping at all. I used to run a small art account with more than 10 K followers. In the beginning I used to create art as a hobby but then the pressure from people to constantly create content arose. It made me feel suffocating cos I started this account as an escape from my busy work life. However a few months later I started feeling as if this account was no different from a boring job. Also the constant updates from friends and families travelling around the world didn’t make it easy. It was not that I was jealous , It was just that I felt my life was not exciting enough. In the beginning I deleted facebook around six months ago, then I disappeared from Instagram almost two months back along with twitter as well as tumblr. I still use reddit but just to read interesting questions. I don’t follow people here neither I chat with anyone. This decision has been very peaceful for me overall. Firstly I am not frustrated with my own life constantly and secondly I am sleeping well. I have also started reading books plus started trading as well as investing. Everything in my life is finally back on track both mentally and financially. Now am earning twice more than before. I am having amazing time with my husband too. Plus the mystery regarding my personal life is kind of getting rid of my haters who were constantly poking their noses in my business before. I have also deleted netflix cos I don’t want to waste anymore money on it cos binge watching was not helping at all. I am never going back to social media again.


PS FOR PEOPLE WHO COMMENTING THAT REDDIT IS A SOCIAL MEDIA ! Its a social media if you use like one but for me its a source of knowledge! i dont even follow people here neither do I have any followers ! I rarely reply to comments except to people commenting in this post because surprisingly enough some are not supportive of other’s progress and many are trying to negate my progress by sarcastically pointing out that reddit ia a social
Media ! Reddit has many faces and fyi most of my karma are even not from my own comments but from people sharing their stories in some of my questions. I have may be asked at best only 8 to 10 questions in a year. SO NO I HAVE NOT LEFT REDDIT ! I LEARN THINGS HERE WITHOUT FEELING THE NEED TO COMPARE MYSELF WITH PEOPLE AND FEELING THE WORST ABOUT MYSELF LIKE OTHER APPS AND  IF THAT DOESNOT JUSTIFY PROGRESS THAN SOME OF YOU ARE JUST PURE EVIL IN BRINGING OTHERS DOWN",minimalism,1647961658.0
The more money I make the less I spend on things,"So I recently had a chat to a friend about how now that I'm older and my career is not bad i.e. make more money the less I'm spending on things. 

I remember when I was younger and obv making less money, I'll splurge on designer clothes, branded name things etc. But after 2 weeks I'd be poor af waiting for the next pay cycle.

I live in a cheap ass studio cos I'm just one person so I think having a bigger place seems excessive. When I was living in a 2 bedder joint I realised I never really used a lot of the space. I no longer buy expensive clothes or branded stuff, the clothes I do buy is usually from Uniqlo.

Most of my spending would be in travel and maybe the odd gadget like new phones or tech stuff but it's rare and only once in a blue moon.

I guess I find it funny cos now I can buy what I wanted before when I was younger but it no longer interests me. I get more excitement living without like having less things and see how I can get survive with the bare minimum.

Does anyone else feel the same?",minimalism,1625579272.0
"The trap of ""I'll just give it away if I don't like it"".","I've always considered myself pretty minimalistic. I had insecure housing as a teenager/young adult and being able to carry the essentials in a backpack made me feel a lot more secure (anyone else?). 

I started dating (and eventually moved in with) a man who- compared to me- is almost a hoarder. To be fair, he comes from a family of immigrants who store EVERYTHING until it can be sold/bartered/whatever, no matter how small.

He always ""needed"" more and more things. More clothes. Electronics. Household goods (can't do dishes without *special* dish gloves, can we??). And of course, over the years, I started to give in. I hated having clutter everywhere and feeling like he needed to fill every square foot of space with *something*. We had to live in LA for his career and I hated that whenever we had to move we had to find a bigger place to accomodate all of his things. I thought of it as paying beachfront rent for a storage unit- a huge waste. But eventually I started to think, ""oh well, if we don't use it then I can always give it away."" It was easier than fighting with him about it. 

We broke up recently he moved out of the apartment a few days before I did. So I told him to take what he wants and leave what he doesn't and I'll take care of donating it. 

Holy shit you guys. Not only did he pack up almost the entire apartment *because it was all his crap* but even *after* moving out I swear there was a metric ton of stupid stuff for me to donate. And you think when you're buying stuff that *someone* will want your stupid crap later but guess what! They usually don't. I had to make several trips to drop off clothes at the homeless shelter, canned goods at the food bank, and books at the library. The rest was thrown out. Just because you paid $100 for an ipod in 2007 doesn't mean anyone gives a shit about it now. 

When he came over and saw the little pile of things I had, he said ""I feel so bad that you have so little, it's like you don't have a life anywhere."" Tf?!? I'm so happy lol. I had a few GREAT pieces of furniture that I dropped off at my mom's for the time being and now it's just a few things and my bed in our old apartment. For the first time the windows aren't obstructed by anything and the sun streams in in the morning and I LOVE it. 

Anyway, just thought I'd share.",minimalism,1625861001.0

Imagine all of your things in a second hand store.,"I was out last night with my son at Goodwill looking for a teapot. We were browsing around the books and random junk and it hit me. When I die, if I have a lot of things left, like my books that are worth money that I keep to sell someday, they’ll probably just wind up here. And if someone doesn’t find those things, they’ll just wind up in a landfill. It hit me that I need to be even more careful about what I bring into the house, and also I should start selling the things that are worth money and save it for experiences. I have collected so many books over the years but now I’m almost 40 and I really would rather be out doing things and living and not reading books.  

Just an observation. Thrift stores are such an eye opener, if you feel like shopping just go look around at all the random junk that people prized at one time.",minimalism,1645456767.0
"Does anyone else disagree with the idea of ""a few quality pieces"" for clothing?","Maybe I just watch too many minimalism YouTubers but it seems like they all say this. They say instead of buying a shirt from Walmart that ""falls apart after five washes"", they'll happily pay $100 for a shirt that supposedly lasts years and years. This seems like such an exaggeration to me. I've got clothes I bought from Old Navy in 2007 that are still in good shape.  Sometimes it just depends on how you care for things and sometimes it's just luck. I've got a couple winter coats that are higher quality than a Walmart brand but got them secondhand from Swap.com for less than $10 each. I never have and likely never will spend more than maybe $20 on clothes and have never had a quality issue like the YouTubers claim. 


Obviously everyone is different and this includes everyone's version of minimalism.  I'm just asking to see if anyone else here relates.",minimalism,1677690883.0
Smartphone is best minimalist tool ever made,"Really, think about it. You have only ONE 6 inch brick. Inside the brick could be:

Your notes
Your grocery list 
Scientific calculator

Powerful translator
Document scanner 
Email client
Alarm clock
Calendar with important events
Camera
Communication 
Order pizza though nice UI website/app with tracking
Streaming music or Netflix

5 years ago, i used my laptop daily. I couldn't imagine not having my laptop for a week. Phone for me was nice gadget, but nothing special. It wasn't smooth, battery life was horrible in every cheaper phone than flagships, internal memory and SD cards was expensive as fuck (and most phones didn't supported bigger SDs than 64 GB), websites wasn't really optimalised for smartphones, cameras with Minecraft quality in everything except flagships, shitty displays. I used phone only for Google authenticator, alarm and Facebook messenger. Android was just fancy Symbian without buttons. 

Now i don't even start my laptop for weeks if i don't need to. I am on dopamine detox till Christmas, so i don't even play games right now. Only thing i do on laptop are homeworks, studying and playing games. I even watch Netflix on phone because displays are great and its portable. It doesn't matter if i am in bed or in a train. Either way, its comfortable. If you add true wireless headphones, you reached maximum comfort. You don't even need to have powerbank, battery life is far better than was 5 years ago. 

Its silly in year 2022 discard smartphones in name of minimalism. Do social media disturb you? Uninstall them and use them only on browser or don't use them at all. Do notifications make you crazy? Turn them off or make them silent. Smartphones (at least the android ones) are manageable. With good management using smartphone have no downsides. Just imagine your desk: no paper calendar, no laptop, no mouse, no cables, not more than one notebook, only few most important sticky notes... Everything in your 6 inch brick.
