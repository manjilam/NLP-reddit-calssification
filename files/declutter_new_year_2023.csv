"I found my white whale, finally! A simple routine to keep my house clean and clutter-free.","A few weeks ago, I asked for your input on decluttering my whole life. I Konmaried a lot, and decluttered, and did a 30-day challenge. I still have a lot of stuff to declutter and organize but I made some significant improvement. 

The thing is, I've always been pretty good at big projects. I handled moving 2 apartments in our house, I re-did the entire back porch, painted the staircase, reorganized the rooms to WFM. What I am not so good at, is keep the place uncluttered and clean, without having to do a major cleaning day on weekends. My husband is actually the one to most of the house care. It was creating friction and I had to do something. 

So I said to myself, fudge it, let's just try something. Anything. No more searching for the perfect routine or a magic formula that would keep the place looking like a magazine. I just need to do something. 

So I started to full and start the dishwasher every evening before bed. Since the countertops were now empty, I quickly wiped them, and wiped the counters in the half-bath. The first day, it took me at least 15 minutes, the second days, 10 minutes. Now,it takes barely 5 minutes. 

In the morning, I empty the dishwasher while waiting for my coffee. It takes 3 minutes, since it's a half-load. It's way less daunting than an overflowing 3 days of dishes and silverware full load! Then I pick-up the clutter and wipe the counters in the up-stair bathroom while doing my skincare routine. That's another 3 minutes. Finally, I do a 5 minutes tidy up of the main floor. Anything that's out of place, I put back in its place. 

The first day, it made very little difference. There was still winter coats, hats and gloves on the dining room table, and craft stuff on the couch, shoes everywhere and books on the floor. On the second day, the couch was empty and the mudroom was clear. On the third day, the mail was in its place, the flyers in the recycle bin, and there was nothing on the floor! 

On the fifth day, I had to go to the basement to find enough stuff and clutter to finish my five minutes of tidying. It was glorious to think that my living room, kitchen, dining room, half bath and mudroom were clean enough that I HAD NOTHING TO TIDY. Not a thing. That is exactly when it clicked for me. That was it. I could do 3 things in the morning and 3 things in the evening, barely 10 to 15 minutes each time and keep a decent and organize house. 

Is it as clean as my mother's house? Nope. The baseboard are dusty, there is dog hair on the furniture and I keep losing the remote. But it's way better. I can open the door without being embarrassed. I can have someone over without going into panic mode.  It's very motivating. It's easy to keep going. It's, most of all, working for me.",declutter,1612205300.0
"I barely wore one pair of shoes for ten years because they were ""so nice I don't want to ruin them"". I wore them and they literally began disintegrating beneath my feet. Use your ""nice things"" NOW.","Don't keep your nice shoes and clothes in the closet for ""one day"" or on the premise that ""I don't want to ruin them"". I kept a cute leather pair of Dansko Mary Janes in my closet for literally ten years and when I finally wore them for the 2nd or 3rd time, they were DISINTEGRATING beneath my feet. I first noticed they were tracking rocks into the house from the gravel driveway. I was like ??? I tried to pick them out to not ruin the hardwood at my boyfriend's house. But the shoes were like, disintegrating, pulling the rocks out also pulled apart the base of the shoe. I tried scratching the bottoms of the shoes on the pavement to get the rocks out, and black rubber crap from the shoes was coming off! These are shoes that are traditionally very hardy-nurses often wear them. But because they (were purchased gently used have no idea how old) sat in my closet for ten years, I guess they disintegrated?


I went to lunch with my dad later that day, just walking on an everyday sidewalk and noticed the bottoms of my shoes were CRUMBLING on the floor of his car???


I threw the shoes away. What use is it to store ""nice things"" if they literally disintegrate or go down in usability due to neglect and age???

Wear the 'nice' things now!!

Wearing my ""less nice"" stuff to ""save"" my nice stuff also created clutter!! I decluttered all my ratty old sweatshirts and coats so that I would be forced to ACTUALLY WEAR my nice coats and sweaters! Not have them keep sitting in the closet.",declutter,1668884868.0
Decluttering revealed why my cat is fat.,"I love my cats and want them to be healthy and live as long as possible. After a year of really trying, one of them is finally slimming down!

However, the other has continued to gain weight.

The chonky gal has had a bit of an obsession with the garage, and I've kind of leaned into that, because it makes the little goblin feel like she's gotten away with something less nefarious than usual.

The garage has long been a clutter-catcher as my  household has ballooned and shrunk from 1 adult to 5 adults and back down over the last 9 years. It has been my major focus the last couple months, and I've decluttered truckloads of stuff.

A friend who moved out about 5 years ago used to save tons of bacon grease. In my decluttering frenzy, I threw away all the bacon grease, save for one jar, which happened to be one of my favorite little jars that she commandeered.

It was this jar of 5 year old (or older) bacon grease, that I saw my fat little cat dip her paw in, pull out, and lick 5 year old bacon grease from her fluffily little chonky paw.

THIS HOOLIGAN has been hanging out in the garage to get hits of 5 YEAR OLD BACON GREASE.

I calculated out how much she's been eating, and she's within the realm of not-going-to-die-immediately, but at least decluttering revealed her secret cracktivities.",declutter,1684974028.0

The sticker method is a game changer when it comes to decluttering. Hands down it has changed my life. Here's how it works.,"I heard this tip ages ago from Alton Brown on one of his cooking shows.  I thought it was genius and it has stuck with me for years.  Just wanted to share as I get ready to do another round of sticker-ing in January!

* Put (easy-peel) stickers on items at the beginning of the year/quarter/your birthday/some eventful date.
* Remove stickers on items when you use it during the year/quarter/time period you specified.
* When you get to the end of the year/time-specified, for items that still have stickers, realize you haven't use that item in a year and get rid of it or at least think hard about if you really want to keep it around another year since it's not adding value to your life.

Alton Brown does this with his kitchenwares.  He stickers lots of his kitchen items at the beginning of the year.  He even told this story on the show about how, mid-year, he'll see ""that purple sticker still on my beloved mixer"" and he'll force himself to find something to bake just so he can use the mixer and justify keeping it.  (His rule is that if the item still has a sticker at the end of the year, it goes.)

You can also write the month/date on the sticker to remind yourself when you attached it. (Too much work for me, I just write down the date and a specific color in my planner.)

When I do use an item and take the sticker off, I find I receive great satisfaction and joy from this act.

I don't sticker my entire house, but I do sticker certain categories of items that seem to get out of hand.  It's the stuff you don't use every day.  Electronics. Office supplies.  Holiday decor.  Ribbon/wrapping paper.  Shoes.  Coats.  The top of my closet.  The back of the cleaning supplies closet.  That cabinet above the refrigerator that is hard to reach.

One year I'll use purple stickers, the next year I'll use yellow stickers.  One year I don't think about coats.  The next year I'll think, ""Are the coats getting out of hand? Let's sticker them and find out.""

If I start to sticker items in January and an item already has two stickers?  That thing hasn't been used in 2 years!  My brain is rational in these moments: ""It's okay to let this go u/telladifferentstory.  Let someone else find joy in this item and use it for its intended purpose.  Let the item have joy and the new owner have joy.""

Even better, I sticker things in January and then notice in October that 60% of the stickers in my closet are still up.  All of the sudden my eyes are wide open.  👀 I end up going on a massive decluttering spree and getting rid of a bunch of stuff as I just realized I don't even touch a majority of my closet.  Seeing colored stickers all over your closet in October is a wake up call.

Final note, the stickers don't have to be big.  Even just a ""mini dot"" sticker put on the center of the hanger (under the hook) or on the sizing tag of a coat will work.",declutter,1610237224.0
the fastest way i convinced myself to declutter clothes i held on to but never wore,"a couple weeks ago, i challenged myself to wear or make outfits using the clothes i had either never worn or very rarely wore, instead of my usual go-to clothes or favourite pieces. these were all regular, every day casual clothes, not clothes for special occasions (it's probably fine to only wear that suit or fancy dress once a year).

i had pieces i thrifted/bought years ago and had never left the house wearing. i could never figure out why i had all these 'nice' or 'useful' pieces that fit but were collecting dust. we all have that one piece we immediately take off after trying it on when we're getting ready, but put back because of its 'potential'. so when i was getting dressed, i challenged myself to put on that shirt i always overlooked or never chose to wear and committed to wearing it for the day.

wearing these items was *the* only way to really figure out why i wasn't wearing them. it's a fantasy-self piece (what only the idealised hypothetical version of me would wear), the colour doesn't match my skin tone, it's itchy, it doesn't go with anything in my closet, it doesn't flatter me, it's tight in weird areas, it's not really my style anymore etc etc.

i would be so relieved to take the shirt off at the end of the day because i felt like crap the entire time i was wearing it, and would even feel kinda embarrassed walking around in public wearing certain pieces because they clearly weren't for me. i felt such clarity about these items that i never would have felt if i had've kept sticking to wearing my go-to clothes.

i threw that shirt straight into a box for donation, as well as every other piece i challenged myself to wear by the end of that week.

hopefully this inspires some of you to do something similar! you don't have to be super serious with this approach, i laughed at myself so many times throughout this process because although those items didn't serve a purpose in my wardrobe, they served as a reminder that we are more than our attachment to *things*. that one pair of pants that you haven't chosen to wear in over a year even though they still fit? choose to wear it today or tomorrow over your favourite pair. you'll either realise you should wear them more or realise why you haven't been wearing them.",declutter,1680773437.0
"idk who needs to hear this but if you are holding on to clothes that you’ll “get tailored one day” or fixed for years, the invisible chains have broken and you are now free to donate them!","If you still can’t let go just yet, put a sticky note on the article of clothing with what needs to be tailored/fixed by X date. Hold yourself accountable and if you don’t get it done by that date, donate it. 

A few more things to keep in mind:

It has been sitting so long that you may not even like the style/colour/cut/fabric anymore. Or it may have even degraded from improper storage. 

You are more likely to go out and buy something that reflects your current style. Your past self may have liked it and thought it was beautiful, but do YOU right now, in this moment feel it reflects your current style?

You obviously don’t like it THAT much if it has been the absolutely last thing on your to do list since forever 

You probably don’t need it and wear something else anyways

Sometimes we hold on to clothing because we like the colour or pattern, but not how it looks ON us. Unless it is displayed as art or something, take a picture of it then donate 

If you feel guilty about it, that’s your sign to donate it. Stop letting an inanimate object weigh you down with negative emotions",declutter,1613076088.0
"I got the greatest compliment, and the one who said it doesn't even know I heard it!","Last week, some of our friends visited our house for the first time.

"This is not going to be a popular post, but ...","I know today's view on decluttering and always include donation, especially for things  you can't sell.But as someone who ran/volunteered at used clothing and homeware drives for the less fortunate for ten plus years, I'm going to say please don't give us garbage. I'm specifically thinking of old, ratty clothes, cheap kitchen gadgets, and opened toiletries. No one wants them and we end up having to PAY OUT OF POCKET to get them taken away. It ends up COSTING us.

The condition of the majority of the clothes we got was horrendous! If it's pilling and the fabric is worn thin, do not donate it. We got leggings with holes in the crotch and tops with armpit stains. It has gotten much worse in recent years as the ""declutter"" trend has grown.

I know people are trying their best, and that can opener still works, but it's garbage and it ends up in a landfill anyway. Why? Because a new can opener is a dollar at the dollar store, and we just got two dozen in today. And your clothes? It ends up in a mountain of garbage in Ghana.

Please understand that we didn't resell what we received, we simply processed them before they went to an organization that provided for those suffering from addiction. So we weren't even looking for ""nice"" things to resell, just decent enough to give away. If you honestly believe that what you are donating is decent, then donate away. But please remember that many of the people donating leggings with holes in the crotch also thought they were ""decent.""

This is a big issue we face. it's especially bad before the holiday season. It clogs up the system.

And for those donating useful items, the people who get them are truly grateful. A few years, we collected used dresses and gowns right before prom so that girls from less fortunate families could go to prom. We also provided baby items to teenage moms, and that was received very well.

I'm only one person and this is my personal experience, but I don't doubt that others who volunteer their time have similar experiences depending on where they live.

"My ""dollar a day"" rule of thumb for getting rid of unwanted gifts","I notice this time of year that a lot of people seem unsure what to do with gifts they received that they don't want or can't use. It feels rude to get rid of them too soon, but burdensome to keep them too long. I thought it might be helpful to share my rule of thumb:

Look up or estimate the dollar value of any gift you don't want, and keep it one day for each dollar it cost the giver. Put it out on display where you can see or use it daily, and each time you do, take that as an opportunity to reflect on the person who gave it to you. Once the prescribed time is up, sell or donate it without guilt.

So a $5 greeting card can sit on the mantle for 5 days, a $25 shirt can get hung up on the closet doorknob for 25 days, and so on. I find the inconvenience to me is minor and temporary, and it honors the gift giver enough that their money wasn't wasted in a way that shoving it in a closet or keeping and resenting it indefinitely doesn't.",declutter,1640623050.0
Pantry is done! It took a week.,"It required two trips to IKEA, but the pantry is done.  Lots of purging and organization of party stuff.

Small tip for those who have trouble letting go of clothes,"I have way too many clothes. My problem is that I have a lot of clothes with “potential”. These are clothes that fit and are in good condition. So I have a hard time letting go despite never having worn some of these items or they haven’t been worn in a very long time.  Various reasons that I don’t wear them is because I don’t feel good in them, maybe due to the color, shape, style, etc. Yet I continue to hold on “just in case”.

Anyways I started going through my clothing and trying each piece on. What REALLY helped was audibly (not just thinking) saying to myself the reasons I didn’t love or care for this item. Just hearing myself say and not only think “This shirt makes me feel sloppy and I hate the way it clings to my chest” made me realize how ridiculous it sounds to hold on to these things.

(Sorry if this is common knowledge, it’s something that I just randomly did yesterday and it helped me get rid of 2 large bags of clothes.) I feel good and I don’t miss any of those clothes at all because I start to remember all the reasons I didn’t like them.

It’s all on its way to the dump and I’m crying,"Swedish death cleanse of a 65 year old mama who kept everything from her kids’ childhood. Stuff was so old the plastic bins were disintegrating.

"My father-in-law was a hoarder because everything was ""useful"". After he passed, 99% of it went into the garbage.","My father-in-law had a battle with dementia and we lost him last year. He had a very nice little house with a fully finished basement, a massive cold room (I mean you could fit 3 couches in this thing), a small kitchen, living room, enclosed porch, 2 bedrooms, and 1 bathroom. Every single room, floor to ceiling, was packed with stuff. He only kept the areas clear that he needed to live in. He also had a 2 story garage/barn that was full of stuff, again, everywhere you looked.

Why? Well, according to my husband, he was always frugal and a saver. Everything had a use. If he saw something on the side of the road, he picked it up. He saved everything. Literally everything.

We knew it was going to be a massive undertaking, and it took 6+ months to clean it out with at least a dozen people helping whenever they had free time. He had a large cabinet in his living room full of stuff. When I cleaned it out, most of it was old peanut butter jars that had been cleaned out and stuffed full of nails, screws, or various plastic bags from the grocery store or other random products. In his attic, we found empty bags of cookies from the 1980s. We found at least 5 sets of dinnerware all neatly wrapped up and put into a box. And so many boxes of clothes that had sat for so long they were matted together. Leather boots that had long since rotted because they were saved for so long. Broken typewriters, broken instruments, broken porch swings, broken TVs and microwaves he would someday ""fix"".

We tried to be mindful when cleaning out his house. We had someone come in and remove anything that could be salvaged for metal. We donated everything we thought was worth donating. We sold items online to be split between his kids.

You know what? 99% of the shit he saved went into a dumpster. A dumpster that cost money for us to have hauled away. We barely earned anything by selling all his stuff we hoped would have value, not nearly enough to cover the cost of throwing away all the junk.

Even worse is the mementos we did find from my husband's childhood. Most of them were donated or thrown away. Why? Well, one, my husband and his sister were appalled by the state of their dad's house and didn't want to follow in his footsteps. Two, so many of those mementos were damaged or rotted away that they had to be thrown into the garbage. Three, they didn't mean shit to my husband or his sister. My FIL kept these things for his kids, and 99% of it went into the garbage. We ended up with 2 items from his entire house - an antique clock, and a little wooden elephant statue.

I hope this inspires some of you today to continue decluttering and avoid saving items you don't use or need. I also highly recommend looking into Swedish Death Cleaning if you are more interested in the idea of ""What happens to all my stuff after I die?""",declutter,1660789473.0
It finally happened. Something I was hanging onto to use at a future date was needed. And it broke instantly.,"I’m sharing this in case you’re saving that one special item that you just *know* will be useful in the future. 

Well, I was hanging on to a plant grow light for when I decided to grow seedlings again. A majority of my plants are a mature size (or as mature as their pots will allow), and they’ve been acclimated to their conditions in my tiny balcony, and said tiny balcony is too small to grow too many new plants. 

I decided to swap out a couple plants and get some new ones in my collection, and lo and behold, even though it had been at least 5 years, it was time to whip out the ol’ grow light! 

Well. It didn’t work. 

Not only did it not work, but it sputtered out with bright flashes of light before finally kicking the bucket. All in about 15 seconds. 

I had been saving this lamp for *just this occasion*…. and it died. I was saving it for so long because 6-7 years ago, this lamp was rather new on the market, and I had spent a pretty penny on it. I knew I was an avid plant enthusiast, so it was *only a matter of time* before I had to use it again. 

So I’m back online looking up new grow lights, and guess what! To my surprise, grow lights have come a LONG way in both usability and affordability. My light required a separate timer to be purchased so you could set the lamp duration, and it required its own stand to attach to. They’re all built in nowadays! And for $20! Stand it up, plug it in, set it, and forget it (until watering day). Incredible. 

I know not everyone is saving their old grow lamp that’s old enough to be a second grader, but I know there’s something you’re hanging on to for *just the right moment.* Well, it’s time to let go of that item. Not only will it not be guaranteed to work (heck, my lamp was in a temperature controlled garage in a plastic bin alone), but by the time you will need it, the new ones on the market will blow it out of the water.",declutter,1658278216.0
How prison penpals helped me become more ruthless with my declutter,"So 2 years ago I got myself some prison penpals. I was going through a phase in life where I felt disconnected from society, imprisoned within my four walls, and dealing with stigma, attached to a chronic illness. I figured, ""Who else could possibly relate to this?"" - which is where this came about.

I have made some great friends and become less judgemental as a person. I have also developed a healthier perspective on life.
Another unintentional benefit has been with my recent decluttering and sorting through my life.

While going through all my stuff recently, the thought occurred to me ""What happened to all their stuff once arrested or sentenced?"" - so I asked both my friends.

They both had the same answer.

All their stuff was gone. They had left what possessions they had in untrustworthy places, with untrustworthy people - such were the lifestyles they had been living prior to incarceration. They had more than likely been sold, stolen or whatever. Those people, places and things were no longer in their lives (in any capacity) and hadn't been for years. 

They just learnt to get on with it, shrug their shoulders. It was out of their control anyway. It was just stuff. They would have to start completely over once released. Virtually the same as someone starting over after a house fire.

The positive progress made and journey they have been on (without any possessions) is proof enough that we don't need most of the shit surrounding us, and the materialistic possessions we hold onto. 

It has certainly helped motivate me to become more ruthless in what I'm willing to get rid of, donate and sell, in my epic task of decluttering!

Just a friendly tip for unwanted jewelry…,"There’s a US based organization called “I Have Wings” which takes costume jewelry and other kinds of jewelry (even mismatched pieces or one earring) and provides them for crafts for the elderly among other things.

I’ve embraced my ‘fantasy self’,"I’ve (49f) become reasonably minimalist in recent years and love watching YouTube videos about how I can declutter and reduce my “inventory”. Anything I keep has to serve a purpose and be something I love and use or appreciate often.

Many videos recommended reducing my wardrobe to only the items I wore and to “let go” of anything I kept for my “fantasy self”. For me my ‘fantasy self’ wore dresses while the ‘real me’ wore tunic tops with jeans, jeggings or smart trousers. I’m a bit top heavy, so longer tunic tops balance me out a bit better even though trousers make me feel a bit frumpy. I also have problems with my (stupidly small) feet so wear trainers/sneakers because shoes are just too uncomfortable.

Anyway, I was going through my small wardrobe/closet and was struggling to part with a couple of dresses I still had. They weren’t party dresses but were really cute and I’d always wanted to be a ‘cute dress’ kind of woman. So I tried one on and was amazed at how comfortable it felt and how flattering it looked. Paired with some pretty sneakers it looked casual but still cute and was everything I wanted it to be but never dared hope for. 

So now I’ve bought another pair of pretty pumps/sneakers that are comfortable but go really well with both dresses and have even bought another dress. I wore a dress to work last week for the first time ever and got so many compliments I was almost embarrassed (I don’t normally like attention but these were from my work friends and they tend to say what they mean). When I got home my husband was “ooh, you look nice” too, which made my day. I’m nearly 50 and it’s been a long time since anyone has commented on anything other than my hair!

So it seems my ‘fantasy self’ has become my real self and I’ll be decluttering my ‘old self’ this weekend!!

I’d encourage anyone in the same rut to just give it a try. Wear that outfit you’ve always wanted to try out. You’ve got nothing to lose and might even find your real self at the back of that wardrobe/closet.

(Edited typo in age)


Another Edit: THANK YOU to the many who responded to this, I honestly didn’t expect more than a couple of people to comment. Certainly not so many positive and encouraging comments. But then we’re pretty good for that on this subreddit. I even had a couple of awards. I’m so so happy to be both wholesome and helpful.

Anyway, I am so happy to have made people smile, encouraged them to embrace their ‘fantasy selves’ - whether that’s wearing certain clothes or it’s accepting themselves as they actually are - or just filled an empty few minutes in an otherwise ordinary day.

Thank you all!",declutter,1662463926.0
Has anyone else had a sudden realization of how much money they have wasted?,I started decluttering a few weeks ago and recently it hit me. All of the things I have bought that I do not use or decided I did not like and kept it on a shelf instead of returning it. I waste money that could be going to better things like savings and debts.

The benefit of unnecessary time on Zillow.,"My husband would like us to theoretically buy a bigger house in about 2 years. Needless to say, he's been on Zillow nonstop, sending me houses we are in no way prepared to buy. I've tried to get him to stop, because it's creating stress for no reason, but eventually learned to just tune it out. And then of course the perfect house in the perfect spot showed up. There was no way we were going to get it, but this inspired a flurry of ""if we could get our house ready to sell ASAP..."" I used every declutter trick I could, I even cleared out the medicine cabinet muttering ""if I can replace it in 20 minutes for less than $20..."" I carried a changing table down a spiral staircase and out the door by myself, I sorted out stuff from all my hard spots, I helped him with his closet and clothes, and all told, we got rid of 2 full curbside bins of recycling, 4 bags of trash, 2 bags of clothing to textile recycling, 4 bags of clothing to the thrift store, 5 bags of stuff to Goodwill, 2 pieces of baby furniture. We saw the house on Saturday and while it was perfect for us, it was also perfect for the 10 other people who put in offers, so, that dream is dashed. But, our house looks great, the kitchen feels nicer to be in, I'm really proud of how hard I worked to get rid of things I was attached to, and I'm in awe at the sheer poundage of \*crap\* we ""needed"" until we needed to decide what was worth storing or packing.",declutter,1677613174.0
Lessons learned from running a garage sale that featured 25+ years of stuff,"This past weekend I helped out at a garage sale that was selling things that had been accumulated for 25+ years. Furniture, clothing, kids stuff, books, housewares etc. You name it, we probably had one or two for sale.

Here is what I learned:

* Don't save things for life events you aren't 100% certain are happening. There were so many baby items, kids toys, cribs, rocking chairs etc. These had been saved for ""our grandchildren"", when there are no grandchildren. Don't keep things for the promise of a life event if you aren't 100% certain it will happen. Beyond the fact that there are no grandchildren, 80% of these baby items were outdated, out of style or potentially hazardous. Unless you know for a fact that your son/daughter has specifically asked to keep their crib for their own kid, get rid of it once you no longer have a baby for that crib. There is no guarantee that you will have the grandchildren, and there is no guarantee that *if* you have grandchildren, that the items will be wanted/in style or even safe.

* Not everything appreciates in value, and saving things because they 'might be worth something someday' is not worth it. We had a couple people asking for comics, and there were two available for sale. Really good condition, saved in plastic packaging, very well preserved. However the price was $5 per comic, based on the fact that when purchased in the 90s they were $2.50, and so they must be worth more by now. No one wanted them until we knocked them down in price. Just because some comics are rare and valuable doesn't mean all of them are. Don't save things for a potential that may never happen. Don't get me started on beanie babies -_-

* No one wants to pay $$$ for used clothing and shoe items. Many of the shoes and clothes were priced in a range that might sell well on ebay/poshmark/mercari, but were unreasonable for garage salers. No one wanted leather boots for $40. For $40 you can buy a new pair of leather boots. If you're looking to sell clothes and shoes at a garage sales, price low. People who want to wear them will buy them and they will be gone and out of your hair which is the goal. People who want to spend $15 on a sweater are more likely to buy that online or at a thrift store than at a garage sale. 

* Get a library card. There were so many books for sale. All of them read, but only once. Unless you are a huge fan of someone or a fandom, want to support the author or collect books, get a library card and enjoy your reading that way. Books take up so much space and are hard to get rid of. They are also never worth their value after the fact. Don't pay $18 for a book and then sell it for $1, get a library card and enjoy your reading for free.

Hope this helps someone who might be saving some things and struggling to get rid of them.",declutter,1688994835.0
You Can't Give This Sh*t Away: On Trying to Sell Your Stuff,"This is a lesson I've learned that I wanted to share after six years of decluttering. I hope this doesn't sound preachy or anything since, as I'm about to illustrate, I'm the slowest learner of them all.

I made the teensy mistake of vastly overestimating how much my used crap was worth. I see so many people doing it - people selling their H&M clothes for $5 less than retail price, people selling their used blenders for over $100, and people selling printers that no longer work for the extremely low price of 40% under retail.

At one point I started looking through my remaining stuff to give away for free what I hadn't been able to sell. It was just cluttering my space and it just wasn't worth it anymore to hold onto stuff for literally years, posting and reposting them just to get $20 for them - I'd rather just skip a few fast food trips.

To my surprise, a lot of the stuff I had been trying to sell, some for a pretty decent amount of money, I LITERALLY COULD NOT GIVE AWAY. Nobody claimed it, for FREE. It's not that nobody in the world wanted it, but unfortunately when you're selling used stuff you have to hope that the right person comes along, and that could take a long time.

So if you have stashes of ""I'll sell that"" items, I'd encourage you to pick just a few you're willing to part with and post them for free, especially lower value stuff, to see how much your stuff is actually worth to the rest of the world. For example, I had things like books, clothes, a heavy duty lock, a makeup bag, posters, collectible coins, etc. that weren't claimed for free, or at least took a while. Take some of your other stuff and slash the price, and see if it even sells. Your blenders, your printer, your sofa. Also consider how much time you're willing to spend trying to sell it - chances are you're paying yourself well under minimum wage to get rid of a lot of stuff. Set a limit and stick to it.

Ultimately you can't sell your way out of buyer's remorse. You're never, ever going to get back the money you spent on that impulse buy, or even half of it. But you can give your old blender to someone who needs it (remember that the person who's taking the time to come get your blender probably isn't rich, and you're helping them by saving them $50 on a new one), and then go out for dinner and have a nightcap in your beautiful, clean space free of physical representations of your financial regrets. It'll hurt for, like, 10 minutes, and then it'll feel great.",declutter,1659847334.0
"My response to the ""What if I need this later?"" question","EDIT: Thank you all so much for the amazing feedback. I made a couple of changes and re-ordered stuff based on feedback.

(This was copied from my [Decluttering Mental Models](http://stewiewrites.com/stewies-decluttering-mental-models/?rd-need-this-later=1))

Many decluttering experts give very simple answers to the question of ""What if I need this later?"" But the honest answer is complicated and depends on the item and your particular situation.

Instead of giving you some simple answer, let me give you ten things to consider:

**Consideration #1: If you need this item in a year, will it occur to you that you already have one?**

Let's say you're debating whether to keep the gravy boat from Grandma Granger.  You've never used it, but you might need it in the future.

It's useful to imagine yourself a year from now hosting Thanksgiving dinner and actually needing that gravy boat. At that time, will you remember that you have this item packed away in some back closet? Will you take the time to pull it out and clean it?

Or will you forget all about it?

(I got this idea from *Decluttering at the Speed of Life!* by Dana K. White.)

**Consideration #2: How much money do you have?**

If you have to re-buy something in a year, will you have enough money to do so?

(Many decluttering experts scoff at this, but a chunk of America is poor.)

**Consideration #3: Do you already have one of these?**

When we declutter, we often discover duplicates and triplicates of various items. How many containers of garlic salt do I really need?  How many copies of *Crucial Conversations* do I need? (I have no idea how I ended up with two copies sitting on my bookcase.)

**Consideration #4: How expensive is this to replace?**

Spatulas cost very little to replace.  KitchenAid mixers cost a lot more.  All things being equal, declutter the inexpensive stuff first.

**Consideration #5: How hard is it to replace this?**

Family heirlooms are irreplaceable. A bread maker may be expensive, but it's easy to find a replacement.

**Consideration #6: How much space does it take?**

Couches take a ton of room. A dozen necklaces from Grandma occupy far less space. All things being equal, get rid of the big stuff first.

**Consideration #7: When is the last time you used this item?**

A good rule of thumb says that if you haven't used something for three months, it'll be another three months before you use it again.  So start decluttering the stuff you haven't used in over a year.

Note: Exceptions to this exist, like with seasonal clothing. Use good judgment.

**Consideration #8: You'll re-buy 5% of what you declutter**

When you declutter and downsize, you'll inevitably get rid of a few things and have to re-buy them later.  Will you be OK with re-purchasing 5% of the things you get rid of? Is it worth having the clutter gone right now?  Is it worth having that space reclaimed right now?

**Consideration #9: How bad is the clutter?**

Does clutter cover every kitchen counter and make it impossible to prepare food? Or are you looking to get rid of few things in a couple of cupboards?

The more clutter you have, the more you need to start getting rid of stuff.

**Consideration #10: Is this part of a hobby?**

I love reading books, buying them, and checking them out from the public library. Books are my hobby. As a result, I keep a lot more books than the average person.

In every other area of my life, I'm more of a minimalist.  I limit my clothes and exercise equipment and regularly use what I have.

So before you get rid of something, consider whether it's part of a current hobby. Be less strict about decluttering stuff for your hobby. And beware of [aspirational identities](/decluttering/reddit=1#tool-5-utility-vs-aspirational-identity) and future hobbies.",declutter,1621803249.0
I've reached the point where I can appreciate beautiful items in stores but not *have* to buy it and just stick it somewhere in my home.,Those days are over.,declutter,1654355915.0
Holy shit I violently decluttered and it feels GREAT,"**EDIT: Well isn't this just the loveliest community on reddit 🥹 Thank you all for the kind words and I wish you all the best in your declutter journeys! We own stuff, stuff doesn't own us!**

I have lived by myself since May 2020 and somehow accumulated an ungodly amount of stuff. I moved from a 2b/2ba (with a roommate) to a 1b/1ba in March 2021.

I have always had hoarding tendencies, and I am a person who can ascribe sentimentality to anything. If I ordered something online that had pretty packaging, you can bet I’d save the box, or the ribbon it was tied in. I was certain I’d use one or both for something in the future. Such pretty ribbon, the possibilities were endless! I'm crafty, so I used it occasionally, but not frequently enough to justify saving it. 

I was convinced that I needed to have multiples of things, in case I lost the current one (common) or just because it was cheaper. Why get one nail clipper for $5 when I could get six for $4?

I made sure to keep boxes and instruction manuals. What if I needed them? I wanted the boxes for when I moved, right?  What if I forgot how to use this cheap electronic good I bought? What if I wanted to see the recipes that came with the Vitamix my mother gave me as a hand-me-down? It’s not like it’s available online, right?

What about the items I bought for projects I wanted to do? I had furniture legs I wanted to spray paint. I still own that spray paint, but I can’t remember what furniture I bought it for. Does that matter? I should keep the paint, right? It’s brand new and unused!

I love clothing, and have a lot of it. Much is comprised of things that fit before covid, but definitely don’t fit now. Even more of it is stuff that I have loved, but doesn’t fit my current aesthetic. Or isn’t my size. This includes shoes. I have a pair of Doc Martens I bought at Goodwill for $40 that I adore the style of, but they just don’t fit. I've owned them for six years, and haven't worn them once. But I can’t get rid of them! They sorta fit, and it was a bargain! Maybe one day I’ll want to wear them?

I have spent so much time organizing. I have bought countless organizers to aid me. I have given tons of money to Bed, Bath, and Beyond, or The Container Store, finding the perfect items that would help me organize my stuff. I would be satisfied when I did a clean, but it never lasted long. Because I was just piling these things on top of each other, still hopeful I was going to use it in the future. I didn’t, because they were buried, stacked on each other, or tucked away, to the point that I forgot what I had and bought new ones to cover.

You may be surprised to hear that my home is neat and tidy. If you came over, you wouldn’t know that I had too much. I don’t like visual clutter. But what that means is that I’ve pushed all the clutter into the unseen spaces — my bedroom closet, my hallway closet, the depths of my kitchen cabinets, underneath my bed. None of these places are fun or easy to investigate. Every time I managed the energy to go through them, I was surprised by what I found there, because it’s made up of things I wanted and needed but have had no ability to find or use because of how densely packed it was.

I’m planning on moving in with my partner of three years later this year and I decided that I need to do the hard things now to save myself suffering later.

I have cleared out six u-haul boxes worth of donateables, and twenty 40-gallon bags of trash and recycling. I have said goodbye to items that I have been desperately clinging onto for 10+ years (stuffed animals that had sentimental value but that I had buried in closets, gifts from friends I couldn’t bear to give away but that I didn’t love and never wanted, extras of things I had bought but recognized that if I was tidy, I wouldn’t need copies of, stuff I promised myself I was going to sell but didn't get around to doing so).

It has felt GREAT. I have had little to no regret of what I’ve let go. I have felt immense pride that I’m finally curating a space that I enjoy. I thought I would be more hesitant, would have more struggles, but honestly none of these feelings are strong or impactful enough for me to change course. Most of what I'm discarding, whether by donation or trash, is stuff I thought I would be desperately attached to that has ended up meaning very little.

Of course I have made choices that are uncomfortable for me. Many. Gifts, memories, items with enduring sentimental value, perfectly good items that I own several of and don't truly need, things I spent good money on but never used or returned. But none of them have bested me, and none of them have been more important to me than feeling clean, happy, efficient, ready for something new. I can feel confident in future purchases because they are things I truly want, rather than things I've collected out of convenience. I can buy a pair of those Doc Martens that actually fit instead of telling myself I own a similar pair, knowing that I will both never use them nor get rid of them.

I can't wait to bring things into my life, and my home, that are specific, wanted, curated, and valued. And to combine what I own and love with that of my partner.

What has been most important for me is:

\- You aren't wasting money by throwing it out. You wasted money by purchasing it. So let it go.

\- Do you love it? Or are you keeping it out of guilt or obligation?

\- Would you think of or remember this item if you hadn't seen it cleaning? Will a picture of it suffice?

\- Is it replaceable, if you're truly worried about it being thrown away?

\- Would another person be able to use and enjoy the item? Would that be better than hiding it away for yourself and not using it?

\- Are you choosing what to throw away? Or are you choosing what you genuinely want to have and keep?

\- Throw away the ribbon. Throw away the box. If you truly need and desire these things, you can buy them individually, less often than you'd think.

\- Watch Hoarders while decluttering. Really.

I hope this helps or inspires someone with their own declutter. Relinquishing control feels amazing, as a person who struggles with OCD. It's possible and it's lovely.",declutter,1688721245.0
Giving beanie babies to trick or treaters?,"I’ve posted recently about my mission to declutter and got great advice so I’m hoping to get your input especially from any parents. Would it be weird to give out beanie babies at Halloween to trick or treaters? They are all in mint condition but I just have so many and I don’t need or want them. I am keeping three but the rest (like 80) I would like to give away. We get 100+ plus kids an hour where I live so I know it can be done. The thing is would parents be weirded out? Would they think it’s a problem regarding germs? Again they are all in great condition with tags attached but I don’t know what other parents would think. I have a son and I wouldn’t be opposed to this but every parent is different. What do you think? 

Also, we do have candy to give out so not just the babies. I’m even considering if I should tie candy to each of them with  Halloween ribbon to make it look more appealing.

UPDATE: Thank you all so much for your thoughts! I bought some cute Halloween ribbon today from Michaels and will be having the babies as an option in a basket. :) Very excited!

POST HALLOWEEN UPDATE!! I gave away all my beanie babies in about an hour! Soooo many kids and parents loved them!! Many parents asked me in excited disbelief if I was seriously giving them away. I loved seeing all the happy faces :)) and surprisingly it didn’t sting or hurt giving them away. Granted, I did keep 3 that were my most favorite.

"My “where my clutter comes from” epiphany just happened..moments ago, and I am speechless.","I have ALWAYS struggled with extreme clutter, and I always blamed in on childhood poverty. That may be true to some degree, but here’s what just happened. I was mindlessly scrolling reddit, and saw a post on a sub I follow, clicked on it, and in the comments someone made such an innocent suggestion to the OP. “You should look at Ridge wallets”…. BOOM. My mind was off. I had to know what made this wallet I never heard of so special that a stranger would offer a recommendation of it to someone on-line. So I looked. I looked at Amazon, at the actual website. I looked at reviews, decided it wouldn’t be for me, so I went back to Amazon to look at other wallets. Why? I have no idea. My wallet is perfectly fine. I didn’t need nor want another wallet before I saw that comment. I started thinking of my other recent purchases. A book I ordered because I listened to a podcast and enjoyed the author’s perspective, though her only book is on a slightly different topic, a little dated, and I have probably over 50 books waiting for me to read them. And the list goes on and on. I’ll be honest, I’m a little ashamed and embarrassed by how suggestible I am. Hopefully this helps me in some way. I’ve done a lot to get rid of a lot lately, hopefully this helps control the inflow.",declutter,1627349577.0
Lesson learned: use items rather than just holding on to them,"I decided to do a bit of organization of my closet today.  To my utter shock and disappointment, as I pulled a handbag off a shelf, the coating on the fabric portion came off in flakes all over my hands.  

I really loved this bag, but it was kind of heavy, and a bit too ""fancy"" for my day-to-day life. Its been in my closet for years. Now its completely useless. I would not even be able to sell this as the top area is disintegrating. Its a complete waste, even though the leather portion, strap, zipper, interior, etc, is in perfect condition.

I should have sold it or donated it years ago. But I liked it and always thought I'd have a day/time to use it.  I never thought it would disintegrate sitting in my closet, but I will take this as a lesson to use what I own when I have it. If I don't use it, its a sign I don't need it. ",declutter,1695076553.0

I had a revelation this weekend,"Like many of you, I get overwhelmed with clutter. A lot of things are stuff I bought years ago---things from childhood, from my 20s, 30s, and 40s (I'm 50 now).

I had a revelation. If I buy something today at age 50, would I expect myself to hang onto it for the next 30 years? Do I want my 80-year-old self to hold onto things I don't use, simply because I bought it 30 years ago? Of course not! Things I buy today are meant to be used now. If I have something worth holding on to, I'll keep---but why would I want my future self to be burdened with things from my younger self?  


I am giving myself the same grace for my past self. Jewelry, stuff I had as a kid and in my younger years---I'm sure my past self wouldn't have expected me to hold onto everything for 30 years! It's ok to let go. 

I will be going through my stuff now with a more critical eye--and I hope this makes it easier for me to let go of crap I truly don't need anymore.",declutter,1612734015.0

Reminder that stuff doesn't last forever.,"I wanted to share something I've been realizing lately. This is what I've told myself in the aftermath:

Let's start with art supplies-markers dry out. Tape becomes stuck to itself. Stickers lose their stickiness. Paint becomes clumpy. Paper gets yellow and brittle. If you're saving something ""just in case,"" and you've been hanging on for years, it's time to let go. 

Same can be said about clothing! Especially nowadays with fast fashion. The elastic in clothes made 5 years ago that I saved for my 2nd child is worn out. Plastic degrades. Ink fades. Humidity might creep into something, ruining it. Screenprinted designs crack on old shirts.

I really wish I had donated this stuff sooner to someone who could have used it and given it a second life rather than let it sit there and become garbage. But you live you learn I guess. Hope this is helpful to those of you working on decluttering.",declutter,1622317662.0
"A list of things you're holding on to that ""might be useful"" but nobody wants: Let's make a list!","* Expired food. Yes, even just a little expired. If you aren't willing to eat it yourself nobody else is willing to either - no, the foodbank doesn't want it either. EDIT: I've been informed that some food banks WILL take expired food! All I've volunteered at haven't though (Ontario) so call your local food bank to confirm, and donate it ASAP!
* Basement-dwelling clothes. The musty smell in them is mold - yes, mold. You don't want to wear mold. I don't want to wear mold. People who rely on charity don't want to wear mold. Toss them - yes, all of them. Yes, even the expensive ones. It's actually better for your health and your home to not have them around.

I've started to treat old purchases like drugs,"So I don't drink or do drugs, but I know these can be expensive habits. I've seen friends spend $50 or $100 on a night of drinking, and non-legal drugs are even pricier. You have to keep buying them too so it's not a one time cost.

The biggest mental roadblock for me is feeling like I wasted money when I get rid of something I barely/never used. By reframing the purchase as, ""what I was *really* buying was the dopamine hit so I did actually get value out of it"", it's weirdly helped me let go of things. 

That $50 board game I played once is my equivalent of buying ~~a gram~~ 3.5 grams of weed, and no one would expect a gram of weed to last forever right? And hell, you're getting a double serotonin hit with the act of decluttering.",declutter,1652291451.0
"Instead of donating everything, I sold all my clutter and made ~$2k","Hey all, I've always had a habit of accumulating a bit of clutter everywhere I settle down. After I moved into my current house and throughout Covid I realized the happiest times in my life were when I could throw everything in a few suitcases and take off. I had some hobbies I needed to be realistic about (sewing/cosplay) and that I was never going to finish all the projects, so I decided to take charge of my space and really clear as much as I can out.   


It also really hurt me to just 'let go' of some of these things I had spent a bit of money on or I had truly loved, but no longer really served me. I kept hearing that donation centers are really overwhelmed and most things won't be used either way. So I wanted to try and get rid of my stuff but also get it into the hands of someone else who would truly use it. It's been about a year since I started this project and I found a lot of resources that helped me get rid of my clutter while also recouping a little money and ensuring the things were being used and I wanted to share some of what I learned!! (And also how much money I made in each category)  


**Books** \- Super easy, low time investment \~$25  
I love Discover Books, its an online used bookstore-type site and when shopping for some gifts I noticed they have a Buyback Program. I gathered up all the books I was looking to rehome and entered all the ISBN's on their site. If they want the book they'll give you an estimate, send you the postage to ship them the books, and all you have to do it box them up and ship it out. I was able to send them quite a few for about $25 and donated the remaining ones!  


**Home Goods/Hobby Stuff/Furniture**, Low-ish time sink, $823  
I found Facebook marketplace works really well for home stuff, I listed larger items/things that generally required pickup and most things would be gone within a few days. I sold cat trees, desks, chairs, dog toys, picture frames, game consoles, a projector and more. This might be a little bit of a sneaky tactic but when I wasn't really sure the value of an item I would list it on FB Marketplace and then on OfferUp but I would make the price on one listing a little higher. Since items moved so fast I would occasionally get an offer on each and just took the higher one.  


**Knick Knacks/Collectibles/Small Electronics**, Medium-Big time sink, \~$1k  
I had a BUNCH of knick knacks and collectibles from trips to Japan and my younger years where I wanted to have figures of EVERYTHING. A lot of these things were still in their packaging!! I just couldn't let them go knowing I had paid for all these blind boxes but they literally sat in a drawer, forgotten for months at a time. I found eBay was the best spot for these items and especially smaller electronics and I even got WAY over asking on some things (listed a Nintendo DS for $100 and received a $350 offer within a few minutes). This was a bit of a decent time-sink in terms of taking photos, listing, replying to questions, shipping, etc. but I did re-home a ton of items and made a decent chunk of change for them!  
Things I sold there: anime magazines, artbooks, anime figures/keychains/toys, old macbook, old digital camera, Nintendo DS, Pokemon cards, old DSLR

&#x200B;

**Clothes**,  big time investment, \~$400-ish?  
Oof this one is a bit of a mess and I still have stuff hanging up in a spare closet waiting to sell but here's what's roughly worked for me??  


Depop/Poshmark - Trendy brands/clothes  
I found that the only things really worth listing on Depop for someone like me are brands that are currently trendy. I found stuff like Adidas, Champion, I.am.Gia, etc. all sell super quickly. And more niche brands go even faster like Omocat. Sometimes I'd sell 3-4 things in a day and then weeks will go by with nothing. But to recoup the cost on some of these things really took the sting out of it.

ThredUp - Mall brands, unbranded clothes  
For mall branded clothes or styles that may not be trendy right now, I found its more worth it to send over to ThredUp in a massive bag rather than hoping I'll offload it on Depop. I had pretty good success with ThredUp and usually all my items would sell, the payouts from ThredUp are pretty meh but even getting $1 back on a pair of leggings I never wear made me feel a bit better. I made about $200 from ThredUp over the last year, anything they don't take from you they will donate.  


Unhoused Shelters/Donate - Bulky clothing items, sneakers, jackets  
I had a few old jackets, puffers and sneakers that I felt would be a pain to try and sell online when someone told me that homeless/unhoused shelters would really appreciate. I separated some of the super bulky items I had like jackets and sneakers and took them over to the shelter drop-off. I wanted to do this last year but with Covid they weren't accepting items at the time. Obv. no money made but I felt these items would be best served donating them here than just dropping them at Goodwill!  


I hope this post is useful to some of you, I feel really inspired reading everyone's posts on this sub and wishing you all luck on your decluttering journey :) <3",declutter,1638228915.0
Spend time with the things you own. You might discover that they've overstayed their welcome.,"A few weeks ago I had a craving to watch some old movies I've had for ages. I thought, it'll be so great to revisit these old faves! It had been 12+ years since I'd watched most of them. Turns out they didn't age quite so well and I realized I'd probably never want to watch them again after that. And if I did, the library or cheap copies on eBay could make it happen. So into the donation box they went!

The DVD-watching exercise expanded to books, clothes, and other crap I've been neglecting for a long time. Turns out I have been keeping around a lot of things simply because I was used to having them, but when it came time to actually use them, they weren't right for me anymore. 

Basically, I've been fighting against the [endowment effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect) by forcing my things to prove to me that they still deserved to be kept. And it's been so eye-opening! Plenty of things have been neglected because I was never going to use them again. Others are still useful and were just being ignored. (No longer! I am using them again!)

It seems so stupidly simple, but as someone who grew up in a hoarding household and has had decluttering struggles of her own, I've been blown away at how effective the tactic of USING MY STUFF has been compared to just evaluating things by sight. (Or touch, for you KonMari fans.)

Pick up something you've neglected and use it. Does it still deserve the space you've been giving it?",declutter,1623270238.0

A trick I discovered that can help you actually get rid of sentimental clothes.,"I'm someone who has emotions attached to certain items of clothing. Whether it's the dress I wore at my college graduation, a blouse I wore when I had my first kiss, or whatever. Or maybe it's just a pair of shoes I wore as a teenager that remind me of walking the halls of my high school with my friends and running around the neighborhood after dark. 

If you have a stash of sentimental clothes, do this --- put them on. 

I was hanging on to a hoodie I wore years ago, at a time I was dating my ex. It was a hoodie I wore to a job that I loved, and I wore it often outside of work. I practically lived in it. 

But when I actually put it on, I hated how it made me feel. It reminded me of my ex and that specific time in my life, and I realized how far I've come and how much my life has changed since then. I am not the same person. And there was no reason to hang on to the hoodie because I would never wear it again.

In fact, I couldn't wait to take it off.

Now this isn't to say you should get rid of all your sentimental clothes, but only if you really don't have the space for them anymore. If you're seriously looking to declutter, try this tip! ",declutter,1702230128.0

"Decluttered my digital photo library from 40,000 photos to roughly 11,000 in the past week. Feeling proud!","Basically my photo collection has been out of control - I’m 29F and was blessed with a digital camera at a young age and just seemed to amass hundreds upon thousands of photos from age 12 and on. This photo-taking trend seemed to stick with me because over the years, I kept amassing thousands of photos every year. I’m talking memes, selfies, blurry photos, duplicates, things I screenshotted and meant to delete, going on family vacations and taking 5,000 photos and never cleaning them up, etc. I’ve had a goal for a very long time of having a nice clean photo library where I could open it up and every image meant something to me. Well, over the past week or so I’ve been pouring my effort into this every night. I compiled all the images off my old laptop onto my current one (so now I can finally recycle/declutter that laptop, woohoo!), and I’ve just worked through every photo individually. I’m by no means finished, but my photo library is much closer to representing me and my happiness now.

Purchased 1 cup to get rid of 30.,"My wife and I started a Starbucks color changing cup collection back in 2018. Well it’s 2022 and we are drowning in color changing cups. Hot cups, cold cups, special holiday cups. I’ve asked her time and time again if we can get rid of some but she is so sentimental it’s near impossible to get rid of shared possessions. Plus these cups aren’t the most sturdy at $3 most last just a few months so she thinks we should keep them until they break. Today I happened upon another color changing cup. It is beautiful, the Starbucks siren swims majestically through the cups light blue background. Another plus is that this cup is made of sturdier materials and made to last. I texted my wife a picture and told her I would buy it but, only if we could get rid of all our other color changing cups. After some back and forth we agreed to getting rid of 30 cups and keep a few of her favorite color changing ones. We now have a total of 4 color changing cups in the house!! Success.

"I started a home business right before covid, and it failed. I donated the wares I was supposed to be selling, and it feels so good.","Backstory: In January of 2020 I started a business designing custom fabric. Fast forward, I've been sitting on a mountain of fabric since around October 2020, when I realised WAY TOO LATE that I wasn't cut out for running a business during a pandemic. Before I started the business, I had a love for sewing (and buying new fabric). The old stock was in my sewing area, and had nowhere else that it could fit, and honestly it felt like it was sucking the joy out of my favourite hobby. It was an immense quantity of fabric (so it was like The God Of Clutter), and it was like a lingering reminder of how much pain that business attempt caused. Debt, anxiety (I spent so much time trying to advertise and network that I'm still burned out on most social media), feelings of failure in general. 

What's more, we live in a rented apartment right now, but we're saving up for a house currently and the prospect of that fabric following me to a new home was like a neverending dread. I kept telling myself I needed to figure out something to do with it, but it was such an enormous quantity that it was a task just to think about. I was sure nobody would even want it, anyways.

Well Monday night I got fed up and posted on my local area facebook group, offering it to anyone who wanted a buttload of fabric for free. It... certainly hurt to give this stock that I'd purchased for a LOT of money away for free, but at this point my sanity was more valuable.

50+ comments and two days later, nearly all of it is GONE. And what's not gone is going to a charity that just needs to organise transport. It's gone to a fashion student who now has enough matching fabric to make a whole clothing line. It's gone to someone's mother in law who just really likes sewing. It's gone to a bunch of different craft groups, charities, and hobbyists. It's GONE.

I feel so free. I can actually continue my decluttering journey now, because the behemoth lumbering around in my loft is gone. And what was causing me so much distress is now sparking joy for a TON of other people. 

So yeah, bit of a weird kind of declutter, but I felt it belonged here because this subreddit really pushed me to want to see it gone. And also, it's such an amazing feeling I had to share.  


(Side note because it's fun if unrelated: because of the debt I am/was in from the business, I had to brush up majorly on my other employable skills to get us out of it... and now I'm in a job that I love that pays money I never could have dreamed of. I'm getting out of debt caused by my business failing BECAUSE that business failed, in a sense. Which is also one of the reasons I gave the fabric away for free. Life's weird as shit.)",declutter,1626275836.0
"After realizing how much more calming my decluttered home felt, I decluttered my classroom.","I’ve spent the last month donating and throwing away literally hundreds of pieces of clothing and items from my home. I have felt this great sense of peace now that my house is decluttered, but when I returned to work I started to feel suffocated by my classroom. 

I had mismatched bins filled to the brim with supplies on every cabinet, tons of old student work and posters all over the walls, outdated books shoved into every space I could fill, etc. I wondered if my students felt overwhelmed by my room and could even focus on what was on the board when there were a million other distractions around my room. 

So I spent this week cleaning, reorganizing, and decluttering. My room looks amazing. I still kept it interesting and colorful, but it’s not so in-your-face now. I was able to make enough room to move the stuff that was stored in plain sight into matching bins inside the cabinets. Now I can just take out the supplies when we need them and put them back when done. Rather than having student work scattered throughout the room, I designated one small bulletin board for it. All the posters and distractions that were around my main board are gone so that when students are taking notes they can (hopefully) better focus on the material. I threw away things I haven’t touched in 10 years. 

Overall I’m so happy I started this decluttering journey. It’s a relief to have calming spaces both at home and at work. I hope my students feel the same.",declutter,1612407039.0

It doesn't matter if it's the easiest or most cost effective - gone is gone.,"I have adopted the above motto for my decluttering goals this year.

As I started cleaning things out this year, I quickly realized I was making pile after pile of things I was fine with getting rid of ... but each pile had a caveat.  So I worked hard but still physically had the piles around me - one needed to go to Goodwill, one needed to wait for heavy trash day, one needed to wait to be taken to Adult kid#1 home, etc.  Final pile was stuff for Adult kid #2 ... who lives across country from me.

I sighed and started the process of boxing the stuff up to hold onto until they visited again (they were just here but I forgot about this stuff).  And then something just snapped a little.

I want this stuff gone.  Keep the cheese, just let me out of the trap.

Went directly to the post office, got a shipping box, and loaded their stuff into it, returned to the post office and shipped it.   Dropped off the partial bag at Goodwill as I went (rather than waiting till it was full to ""not waste a bag"".  Dropped off the stuff at Adult kid #1 home too (even though I hadn't called first or waited till they were home).

I am just too nice sometimes. I try to do things too correctly sometimes.  If I want to make real progress I need to embrace the chaos of taking risks, ""wasting"" resources, and incurring a small amount of additional cost.

(FTR the large trash item I did hold onto but moved outside even though it doesn't look nice.  Will get rid of for free next Wed vs renting a truck to haul to the dump since that would be a big expense.  Still proud of me.)",declutter,1673185727.0

Her teacher this year for first grade puts a lot of emphasis on organization too.

So today I had to pick her up at school.  (She hurt her chin.) After urgent care, a Starbucks (a rare treat) and a nice nap, I find her in her room cleaning.  She gets done and for 7, she did a good job.  She got rid of several things. She pulled out her clothes and organized them by size and handed off a bunch that will go to her little sister. She sorted through her various treasures  (McDonald's toys. Valentines. Various doctor/dentist prizes.... ) (Yes old valentines are garbage to me... but to her they are to be carefully considered.)

When she was done, she looked around and said, ""I needed this.  I feel better.""

Getting rid of all scraps and random pieces I called 'lounge wear',"And investing in two proper pairs of lounge wear/daily wear that are my size, that I can mix and match and wear almost every day comfortably have been a game changer.

I finally cleaned and decluttered my room for the first time in almost 6 years!,"Hello all! 

As the title says, I finally got the motivation and pushed through my anxiety to clean and organize my room after almost 6 years.

I am 23 and have hoarding tendencies just like the rest of my family. 

With most things in my room, I'd have the usual justifications, ""oh this can be useful in a few years if I ever need it!"" 

And ""this outfit/shirt is sooo cute, ill save it for when I finally lose that last 15 pounds!"" (But, those times never came.) 

Or, ""but someone gave this gift to me that I dont really want, but ill keep it cause its the thought that counts!"" (I seriously had old dead dried up roses in my room from my 17th birthday just lying around on one of my dressers.)  

In early December 2020, I was looking around my room at what it had become. I personally hoard things like old boxes, papers, pens, SO many clothes with tags still on it, unused purchases from the dollar store, and old presents / gifts.
 Just the thought of going through everything in my room would absolutely overwhelm me and give me tons of anxiety. 

I used to have the mentality that if I cleaned something, it would HAVE to all be done in one day, or it would all need to be done quickly. Naturally, that's a super overwhelming prospect! 

I told myself that I can break it up into sections- just do one little spot every day. And if that day, i just didn't have the mental energy to do it, then I could take a break from cleaning and try to make a game plan for another spot instead. 

But for some reason in early December, I got the motivation and clarity to start on my room and do a total overhaul. (Though I will admit, I am fortunate where I only have to deal with my one room.) 

I started in one small corner of my room and was able to calmly think about what I'd do with the items in that spot. (For example: old alcohol flavoring, huge yoga mat, old boxes, an unopened/unused bidet, and a suitcase) and I came up with organization ideas for about 5 or 6 items and actually took care of them the next day! 

That continued for the next month! 

In total, I ended up getting rid of 7 bags of clothes, 4 bags of random donate stuff, and probably 5 bags of just trash (paper and boxes). I consigned clothes, sold electronics and random stuff. The rest, I was able to donate or give away. It was an incredibly therapeutic feeling and so freeing! 

My closet was the worst spot in my room. It had blankets, comforters and 9 pillows on about 1/3rd of the closet that took up much room. The rest had clothes, trash, papers and boxes. It took me about a week to tackle and clean the whole thing. I can proudly now say that its actually a closet I can actually use and walk into! The floor before was completely covered. It all went up to my hips at least. 

The closet was a major source of anxiety for me. I actually originally planned to do everything else BUT my closet, it was so bad! But I was on a roll with the rest of my room and mustered up the courage to tackle it and pushed though my anxiety. 

Now, a month later, my room is 99% done, just a few detail spots I'm trying to finish. I also purchased some bookshelves that helped immensely! (I had tons of books and movies that I had stacked along my walls in random places.) 

I'm really sorry, this got a bit longer than I anticipated it to be, and kinda jumps around a lot. If you read the whole thing, thank you so much!

Decluttering my stuff led to decluttering my relationships.,"I did a big declutter a few weeks ago, which obviously feels really good. Cleaned out my closets, reorganized my music gear, gave away a bunch of toiletries and makeup. 

But I also decluttered (unfollowed) over 250 accounts on Instagram the other night. 

There also had been conflict building up with my roommate’s compulsion to take up a lot of space for the past year, and I finally got to set boundaries with her. Let’s just say I am finally able to buy and cook my own food because there is room in the fridge again! 

And I also confronted and forgave a spiritual mentor who was manipulative and hurtful to me after holding quiet resentment for over a year. 

And OH MY GOSH YOU GUYS I feel like a new person. I think that decluttering my physical space made me see the other things (people) in my life that were encroaching on my inner well-being. Actually following through and setting boundaries was hard but absolutely worth it.",declutter,1612979548.0
Finally realized my mom’s voice inside my head is why I was holding on to so much stuff for so long,"There are some items I’ve been carrying around for years: from dorm to apartment to the next apartment to the next to my first rental house and then now I’m finally in my first home.

We bought a fixer upper, and have slowly been transforming it into our own over the last year. This has forced me to confront boxes I’ve moved time after time, but always dreaded unpacking (and some that didn’t get unpacked for a few moves).

I have a bulky, huge white jewelry box that was gifted to me as a teenager. I remember the disappointment I felt when I opened it (mostly because as a teen I wasn’t interested in jewelry) but I remember the excitement in my mother’s voice asking if I liked it. I’m now almost 27 years old and have been lugging it around for over ten years. It doesn’t match anything and it doesn’t have much in it. My expensive jewelry is in a delicate and lovely hand painted jewelry box that was a gift from my husband. Today, it finally clicked “I keep this for my mom, not for me” and I plan to donate it. 

Then, I realized there are a lot of items I’ve carried for years because I always heard my mom gush over it (jewelry box) or talk about how much she liked it (a shirt that doesn’t fit quite right, but is otherwise cute that I make the mistake of forcing myself to wear like once a year and it doesn’t make me feel good/happy because it doesn’t fit right). I would much rather rehome, donate, or gift these items to people that will actually appreciate them rather than carry them around out of guilt.

This is my space and I want to surround it in the things I pick out or enjoy- and for me that means less things. Less clutter. My mom doesn’t live here, so even though the gifts were sweet, it was a gift and not an obligation.

Epiphany about the “silent to-do list”,"So, a lot of people have heard that every item in our home contributes to our “silent to-do list”- “ *oh, I need to clean this, return that, finish that project* “. We also know that statistically, women are more likely to have a lower clutter tolerance than men, experiencing more anxiety when spaces are cluttered than most of our male counterparts. It literally just dawned on me, as I tidied up before bed, that a large part of why women generally have a lower tolerance for clutter is because we’re more likely to be the ones having to deal with the silent to-do list. If someone is doing almost all of the household chores, of course clutter and excess is going to bother them more, because they’re the one that has to actually deal with it. I can’t believe this hasn’t dawned on me until now.

Delete those songs you keep skipping!,"This one is important! We overlook the things that we consume everyday and music can be very hard to let go of. Between my Apple Music and Spotify accounts I have almost 10,000 songs. I love love love music, but where do we draw the line? So after a quick week-long music fast, I started deleting songs left and right. I'm down to 4,818 right now after a week of intense mass decluttering! 

Yes, music can span a long time and some songs we hold dear to us, but how do we make room for the new things? Mind you, this was spur of the moment and pretty dang close to overwhelming, so I'd recommend deleting songs that you don't like or value as you come across them.

I found out I had been hoarding papers in an “out it sight out of mind” state and it felt so good to throw it all in the recycling bin. We also threw out manuals for appliances that we didn’t need. It was about 140 items total so it knocked out those last 4 days.

I also found a recycler in the area that takes textiles. I got rid of 7 pairs of shoes, old blankets, old bath and hand towels, and old clothes; all which were too worn out to successfully donate and I don’t feel any guilt!

Anyone else hate the process required to sell/recycle/dispose of stuff?,"I have no problem with decluttering and determining what items in my life spark joy, but it's the process of selling/donating items that really gets me. Some stuff is easy to sell, but with others I worry that thrift stores get overburdened with clothing, there are no convenient ways to dispose of cosmetic products (like barely-used hair spray, barely used eyeshadow pallet), and as a collector of rocks/minerals, how do you get rid of rocks that don't spark joy? 

I don't have a FaceBook so I can't post to my local ""buy nothing"" group. It's just exhausting going to the thrift store and trying to deal with selling things on Ebay. It really emphasizes the extent to which I've held onto items that don't add value to my life.

You know the deal.

I had this body spray that I absolutely HATED from the moment I bought it. Every time I used it I was grossed out. But I kept using it anyway, convincing myself maybe it wasn't so bad. Finally one day I said you know what, INTO THE GARBAGE FOR YOU. And it was so freeing!

As we head into a new year, consider this your permission to just throw it out. Yes recycling, reusing, and giving away is ideal but you can't suffer with stuff you don't need holding out for the perfect moment to let it go. Let it go right now. Into the trash. Take that shirt you hate that the thrift store doesn't want anyway, cut it up, use it to wipe off your toilet and THROW IT AWAY.

Moving forward, be more thoughtful with your purchases. Ask yourself ""do I really need this?' But for the love of all that's holy, give yourself permission to throw things away every now and then. Decluttering is not about following a perfect template toward liberation from stuff, it's about letting go and giving yourself the lovely, liveable space you deserve. Toss it!

2020 achievements - $4000+ sold and 10 garbage bags.,"Just wanted to share my decluttering success story from 2020.

I had a major decluttering in 2019 before but I continued to declutter in 2020.

With the pandemic, I made a small project out of selling on ebay. And have earned over $4000 dollars getting rid of stuff. I also got rid of an additional 10 garbage bags worth of stuff over the year.

I have been relatively busy as I am an essential worker so this is a result of doing things in my free time; about a hour a week outside of an initial  selling push during the first pandemic lockdown, I continued to post about 1 or 2 items a week.
To be honest I don't feel like I dedicate too much time to this endeavor. 

For those of you who have never sold anything on ebay or online I challenge you to try selling one item.

 The extra cash really helps and you will look at things differently. You will also be surprised at what you own has value I think the big mind set hump you have to get over is doing the leg work of understanding shipping , having shipping tape on hand and printing labels in case you don't have access to a printer. That is why I recommend selling a single item in order to get your brain to learn the different small steps that people gloss over when they say. ""just sell it on ebay""

In 2021 I will look to continue this habit of decluttering. I have sold about $100 dollars so far.",declutter,1610385059.0
I gave up.,"I’m not sure how this will be received here, but I thought I’d share anyway in case anyone is struggling like I was. 

I’ve always had mental health issues and a problem with staying on top of my home, both with actual clutter and cleanliness. I got into minimalism years ago and consider it my saving grace. My home was mostly in order for a long time.

Enter the last few years. After a move to a much smaller house, welcoming our first child and getting PPD while having a husband that works 6 days a week, experiencing chronic fatigue and oh yeah, going through a freaking pandemic I lost control of my home. Again.

I did what I usually do when this happens. I got stuff ready for different donation places based off of need. I stored everything that required special recycling (electronics, plastic bags). I set aside things to ask if certain family members wanted them. Kept a few things to be listed for sale. Etc.

I completed these tasks successfully for a while, but as time went on and my mental/physical health deteriorated things got worse. The to-do list got too long. It didn’t seem to matter how fast I cleaned stuff out, my daughter always needed something new or grew out of something old that would take up the space I had just created. I felt like I was on a hamster wheel not making any noticeable progress, just barely holding the line steady.

Until I wasn’t anymore and things got bad. Too cluttered. Unhygienic. My toddler’s room started to morph into a storage room for all of these waiting to be dealt with items. I couldn’t clean things properly because I couldn’t easily access the areas I needed to.

One day as I once again began to chip away at the pile, something in me snapped and I just.. threw it all away. That is correct. I threw it all in the trash. My mental health had gotten so bad, our home so full that I was struggling to function in it and properly care for my child. So I got rid of it all in one fell swoop.

No charity runs. No special recycling. No saving things for certain people. No social media postings. No sale listings. Everything gone, just like that. 

It’s been a month since then and I still don’t quite know how to feel about what I did. Regardless of whether it was the right thing to do or not, I am now able to easily do the things I need to do to care for myself and my daughter, and because of this my mental health is better than it’s been since I had her nearly 2 years ago. It’s been easier on me physically too. So I ultimately don’t regret taking back control of my home even though I wish it had been under better circumstances.

I’m hesitant to say this but if you’re going through something similar and things are getting dark both in your mind and in your space, I am giving you permission to just chuck it all. To have a clean slate so you can stabilize and remove the impediments to caring for yourself and your family. To not recycle or donate or post every little thing. Your well-being is more important than the stuff. Your home is not a storage facility nor a trash can. It’s alright to let go of doing things the right way, the best way in order to survive. 

Sometimes we have to burn it all down to start anew. Sometimes we don’t have the spoons to do this decluttering thing ‘properly’ and that is okay. I hope to resume my old way of giving things away to proper homes in the future, but in the meantime while that is not possible I must remind myself I still have the power to reclaim my home and so do you.

Hats off to all of you on this journey who are battling mental and physical illnesses. Don’t let the guilt stop you from saving yourself.",declutter,1667234042.0
I hope this doesn't sound too harsh - but I really had a reality check this past week.,"So this is going to be a little long and possibly triggering for folks who have control issues as well as clutter issues. (which is probably many people here - it certainly describes me) And please keep in mind that I also have pack-rat tendencies and I am NOT judging here. I have my own issues. Particularly with vintage cookware and Christmas decorations...and cookbooks....and DVDs.....and art supplies - you get the idea. But I just got a dose of reality and I hope that passing it along might help someone look at their possessions in a different light. It helped me quite a bit.

My husband and I have two sets of aging parents who have been married for 50+ years. Three if you count my childless Aunt and Uncle – they will also be my responsibility when the time comes. These three couples live in three states of clutter. My parents are full on clutterers - border line hoarders, my Aunt and Uncle are all about the facade, and my in-laws live in a house so clean it’s like a museum.

Well my MIL went into memory care last week, and FIL decided to downsize, so it was time to clean out the museum. For those of you who have never helped clean out a relative’s house this is how it goes. (And for those of you who have – it is SO much worse when the relative is ‘helping’.)

Your process starts off as respectful as possible. Items are arranged in piles – to throw, recycle, donate, redistribute. The 25 bottles half full of hand cream hidden in the linen closet is endearing and the bottles are moved to a pile so they can be redistributed or donated if they are still usable. But the days wear on, and the 15 pairs of nail clippers in the bathroom vanity, 30 pairs of headphones in the desk; jackets and purses and tote bags oh my!; old electronics that don’t work, stacks of stereo components, and enough coolers for all the tailgaters in Pittsburgh - start to wear on you and the lines between those neat piles you were making start to blur. All this stuff has to be hauled out of here to go wherever it is going. We have three pickup trucks but a limited number of days to get back to our lives and now the guilt that we all feel when we are going through our own things doubles and triples because now it is someone else’s life we are dealing with.

Finally you get so overwhelmed that nearly everything, including that first pile of hand cream bottles, is shoved into contractor bags and hauled to the dump because there is just. Too. Much.

And that was the MUSEUM. The neatest of the three houses. My in-laws had already done the ‘Swedish Death Cleaning.’

My Aunt and Uncle have undoubtedly done the same thing as my in-laws – hid their messes away in closets and drawers - but in addition they have a 'secret' storage unit, a doll collection that takes up an entire room in the house and every flat surface in every other room PLUS an obsession with QVC jewelry most of which is still in its packaging?!?! Right – never worn. She couldn’t wear it all in her lifetime. And I am their sole heir. Lucky me. W.T.F.

My parents live in a three-decker home with a full basement in an historic neighborhood. That is four floors of Stuff. Yesterday, my husband and I concluded that when the time comes, we are just going to have to park a dumpster in the driveway and throw stuff out the windows. I am NOT kidding. It will be the only way to deal with the 90% stuff vs 10% objects of sentiment/value.

So before I started unpacking the 10 boxes of stuff from the museum to add to my own pile of stuff, (I know! Right? We ALL have our issues. No judgements here.) I started to go through my own things first. I have quite a donation pile already and it’s only been a day. I think what I’m getting at here is that it might help to look at your things as though they are someone else’s things. Try (Gods know it’s hard) to distance yourself from the stuff. Because sooner or later they WILL be someone else’s things. And they will be overwhelmed.

Blessings and good luck.

"Someone shared this article in another subreddit I'm on and I thought you guys would like it!

The author explains how they did some studies about a weird phenomenon they noticed in themselves and others: if they decided *once* early on that something was too nice to use for an occasion, they were even more likely to decide against using it again and again. Things that were not inherently special or valuable took on a specialness that prevented them from ever being enjoyed (e.g. an ordinary bottle of wine started to feel like a wedding toast wine, a Target shirt became viewed as an extra special blouse, etc). 

Eventually some things would get used for an extraordinary occasion, but often enough, they would go unused until they had gone bad, gone out of style, and so on. This ""specialness spiral"" then ends up being a big cause of clutter accumulation.

Old grade school papers and notebooks comprise 80% of my clutter. Bad school memories also make up 80% of my intrusive thoughts and nightmares.,"I was decluttering my room for *""the last time""* today, and I just realized this. It can't be a coincidence... can it?

&#x200B;

I have a nightmare about school memories at least once a week: teacher's face, teacher's name, procrastination, social troubles, the bullying, and more. Yet, at the same time, I struggle to throw away things like old essays and all my notebooks.

* I think they might be useful someday.
* Good or bad, the uniform is still a memory, so we should keep it, cause we should be able to keep memories that I don't agree with.
* The teacher that I was afraid of, and/or hurt me, gave me a good score on that essay, so I should keep it.
* I might need some binders in the future.
* The teacher wrote criticism on that paper for incompletion or tardy submission. It doesn't feel good to look at.
* I was Student of the Month that one time, but my teacher avoided me completely that day. He looked mad at me. Let's keep the award paper anyway.
* Keep the awards. What if I need to show them to someone someday?
* I should keep that discipline paper I got, on the day where a teacher and my parents lectured me for skipping the 2 hr Tues/Thurs/Sat SAT prep after school sessions... and Dad talked about being fed up and loving to move far away from us.
* Why do I not know what I should be proud of enough to display?

&#x200B;

I **hated** school. I discovered old writings where I'd literally describe why life wasn't worth living, at *10-years old*, and how unbearable school experiences were. I never knew ""depression"" was in my vocabulary. I was miserable.

School memories stress me out.

Yet I struggle to get rid of them. Physically.

Life after living with a hoarder: divorce/separation edition.,"Another update post. I know some across this sub have been following my journey. This time, I'm seeking insight and perspective. 

TL,DR: Just left my abusive husband about 4-5 days ago. Among his laundry list of issues was a ***serious*** hoarding problem. Finally ripped the proverbial band-aid off earlier this week and told him I think we should separate. We stayed in separate hotels this week, and I just picked up the keys to my new (rental) condo yesterday. 

Married nine years. Thankfully, no kids. We spent the last 3.5 years in a 2,700+ sq ft house (that HE wanted to buy but barely ended up contributing to either financially or by way or chores/upkeep), and he kept stuff piled floor to ceiling in the two-car garage, the 1,400 sq ft of finished basement area, both utility rooms in the basement, all three guest rooms, and even in the bathroom that was in the basement. 

I spent 3.5+ years asking him to declutter and purge and clean. Zip, nada, zilch. Most of my requests fell on deaf ears. Even in the final ~90 days leading up to the sale of the house, he *still* barely lifted a finger around the house. I did as much as I could on my own, but because I have an autoimmune disease that affects my musculoskeletal system, I had to hire professional junk removal crews (on several occasions) to help with a lot of the heavier lifting. Not only did that cost me thousands of $, but it also easily consumed hundreds of hours of my own time, too. 

Yesterday, I picked up the keys to my new (rental) condo. It's a 1bd/1ba condo and approximately ~1,100 sq ft. Aside from a few items in the fridge, it's completely empty at the moment. I'm staying at a friend's place right now (she's away for her wedding) cat-sitting for the next ~10 days, so at least I've got a bed to sleep in while I wait for my own bed to arrive at my new place. 

My experience living with a hoarder has completely and utterly shifted/altered my relationship with and perspective on the concept of ""stuff"". Whenever someone asks me about furnishing my new place, or when family members make well-intentioned recommendations, I internally panic and feel paralyzed. *No*, my brain thinks. Beyond a bed, one fork, one knife, one spoon, one plate, one cup, and *maybe* one small couch/sofa, I don't want anything. 

I feel like ""minimalist vibe"" is a term that gets thrown around a lot these days, but for me, it has taken on deeper and different meaning. When I see photos of what is coined as a ""minimalist vibe"", I almost feel sick to my stomach. It still feels like too much clutter and stuff. 

Has anyone dealt with this sort of thing? How do I get past this paralyzing feeling within me? 

I also labeled my post with the success stories flare, because aside from my panicked feelings about future decor and furnishings, I consider my situation a win. I got out. I escaped. Although I'm an emotional yo-yo right now, I'm looking forward to slowly rebuilding and regaining my peace and freedom.",declutter,1694869479.0
I just lost 100 pounds!,"I'm an admitted hoarder of paper, so I resolved to unhoard this month. We had a 2-drawer filing cabinet that was so full, closing it was a chore, in addition to a small file box on a top shelf of our laundry room that none of us had opened in a decade at least.

Reminder: “Collecting” may be Shopping Addiction,"Oftentimes, people validate their shopping addictions by calling themselves “collectors.” This gives it legitimacy by making it into a hobby, disguising the true nature of the action. It is an addiction to purchasing a specific type of thing. More problematically, calling yourself a “bag collector”, “shoe collector”, “makeup collector”, “18th century coin collector”, “rare stone collector”, “pen collector,” etc. ties it to the identity and makes it harder to get rid of.

For context, last year I developed a hobby of getting really into perfume. I would read about each perfume, learn the notes, learn about the house it came from. I would even read books about scent. I also purchased and received a lot of perfumes as gifts. However, despite wanting a “iconic scent” I wouldn’t use them up to completion, and would seek the next purchase, despite having lovely perfumes already in my collection. People identified me as a perfume hobbyist/collector. Since reflecting on my relationship with perfume, I now use up each perfume and have developed low-consumption hobbies (drawing, painting, running, lifting weights, organizing my apartment).

Ask yourself: do you really enjoy and use up each item you get, or do you spend more time scoping out the next one? Take your time to enjoy and use each item to completion before purchasing a new one. And finally, try to structure your hobby around actions, not purchases.",declutter,1643642275.0
So grateful for my TaskRabbit Organizer,"Sometimes you need to admit that you need help. I'm getting ready to move from my home of 30 years to take care of my family on another coast. To describe it as stressful doesn't even come close. My friends have been amazing, but sometimes you need to call in a professional. I looked through a bunch of TaskRabbit profiles and found someone who seemed to fit my needs and I liked her unusual picture so much I thought, ""even if today is a bust, at least we'll have something interesting to talk about"".

She came in like a big ball of sunshine. We went through my closets and in a couple of hours had cut my wardrobe  in half. Then, and this is the best part, she hauled away everything that I didn't want (7 big bags). I wasn't left to ponder what to do with everything, it was just gone. She was so nonjudgmental and stayed focused on the task. Whenever I dithered she asked a few pointed questions and got us back to business.

It worked out so well that two days before move day I have her coming back to help me pack. 

The intense sense of relief of letting things go, and knowing that I won't be burdened with them anymore has been incredible. When you stay in a place so long you can begin to be weighed down by stuff. It happens so gradually you don't even notice. Then when you have to suddenly let go and get moving it's overwhelming.

I've also managed to clear out more of my daughter's clothes (sold on Facebook) and decluttered under my bed. We have an ottoman bed which was full of junk and is now full of less junk. 2 bags to donate to charity, 1 book collection (18 books) to sell on eBay.

the only time i've regretted getting rid of something,"...was when i was in a deep depressive state for weeks, and had a sudden burst of energy to \*DECLUTTER!!!!\* my clothes and craft closet. i just kept asking myself, ""does this give me joy"" and donated 1/2 of my closet and almost all my crafts. now i'm in a better place and i miss my puzzles, painting supplies, shirts, dresses. 

dumb hoe, nothing gave you joy back then. 

also the ""decluttering"" may have been a distraction from not wanting to do actual important things at the time, like taking out the garbage or vacuuming.

(definitely not saying that if you have depression you can't declutter, but perhaps think to yourself why you want to declutter something. lazy susan you've kept for 3 years and never found a use for: can go. getting rid of your favorite dress because you hate yourself and how you look in everything but haven't worn anything non-pajama in weeks: perhaps reconsider.)

It's ok to put things in the trash... especially trash,"https://good360.org/blog-posts/avoiding-the-second-disaster-how-not-to-donate-during-a-crisis/

Just wanted to post this here as I know many people on this reddit like to donate used items or assume there is some ""other"" person who will fix their broken items or appreciate their single shoe.  If you don't see a value in it, a complete stranger is unlikely to.  Please don't send objects to support natural disasters or crisis centers.  There are countries in Africa currently deluged with our ""charity"".  Yes there is always a theoretical ""someone who could use this!"" but you don't need to hoard those items until you find that special someone.  It's ok to trash things and move on.

If your upset by trashing an item it would do a greater good to look at the item, and asking how you can reduce your consumption or buy with the plan for repair and longevity when you next purchase an item.  And still put that item in the trash.  If you are feeling generous and have the time, take a pic and put it on a buy nothing group for a week.  If there is no interest, accept the groups vote that it isn't valuable and trash it.  But don't hold onto that object for infinity ""until"" (until you find someone who needs it, until you have time to put it up on a buy nothing group, until I have time to fix it, etc.)",declutter,1680533065.0
"We finally have a spot for the ‘too clean to wash, too dirty to put back in the drawer’ clothes","Like many, my husband and I have struggled to know what to do with clothes that are worn multiple times before washing. For years we have used “the chair” or piled them on top of the dresser. In general we keep our spaces pretty clutter-free, so the piles of semi-clean clothes have always driven me nuts. 

Part of our problem stemmed from us sharing one big dresser since we moved in together. It had big, deep drawers that were stuffed to capacity and difficult to keep organized. We finally decided to get two dressers, one for each of us. While setting them up, my husband had a simple yet truly life changing idea - the top drawer of his dresser would be solely dedicated to the clothes he wears multiple times before washing. I did the same and, my goodness, it is incredible how much of a difference having a designated spot for those clothes has been. I am still breaking the habit of throwing my clothes on the chair or the corner of the bed, but now I catch myself and can tidy up in 5 seconds. 

As a bonus, transferring clothes from our old dresser to the new dressers provided an excellent opportunity to reevaluate and get rid of clothing we don’t use. We both probably decluttered about a third of the clothes we had in our old dresser. 

I keep telling my husband that, after marrying me, this is the best idea he has ever had. I have told pretty much everyone in my life about this, and I just had to share with this lovely community!",declutter,1676554043.0
A Museum likes my stuff!,"So I’ve reached declutter-nirvana today. 

Over 3 decades, my family developed a nice collection of a particular type of very niche object. Although I have stopped expanding the collection since the early 00’s, it’s been kept neatly and in good condition in storage boxes.

Since the collection was no longer “sparking joy” (but I couldn’t bring myself to throw it away) I searched online and actually found one of the only museums in the world specialising monothematically in this nice object.

I contacted them and sent them photos, and they said they wanted them for their collection! Yay! This is the true meaning of “going to a good home”.",declutter,1663981458.0
Your kids are watching...,"I just had a fit of giggles upon finding something my five year old did. 

Slowly over my decluttering/minimalism journey, I've been working on finding good ways that work for my home in terms of organizing what I have kept after decluttering purges. I've found some containers and organizers here and there that I enjoy and my kids see me using them all over the house, including their rooms. 


Y'all, my five year old took an empty egg carton from the inside recycle bin (I take out everything once a week to our recycle dumpster) and 'folded' all the Barbie clothes she could find in the playroom and put them in the egg carton just like those organizers with a bunch of tiny squares that you fold and tuck smaller things like socks or undies in. 

Kids are amazing guys. They're like sponges and they'll pick up on good habits if you practice them too. If you needed any extra motivation, consider this a fun one.

I just “finished” decluttering my whole house and I feel…not that great.,"So over our holiday break I decided to really cut down on our clutter. My husband was off for a week and we gutted nearly every room. It looks beautiful, and functions great, but that’s it.

Expectations vs. reality of inherited books I thought would be treasured by original owners,"When my grandma died several years ago, I inherited some of my mom's childhood books. My mom had me in her 40s and is 74 now.  

There's a hardback chapter book from my mom's childhood in the 1950s that a) is out of print, b) the titular character of the book has my mom's name and even looks like her, c) as a kid, my mom had neatly written her name in the book multiple times, as if quite proud of it. Surely this was a book of treasured significance; getting rid of it would be sacrilege. 

I sent my mom a photo of the book and her cursive inside it. Her response, essentially: ""Oh, that? Struggling to remember it... you should sell it if it's worth anything.""

Similarly, a few years ago I asked my dad (70) if I could take one of his books from his house. I recently got around to reading it. This was essentially our convo: ""Dad, I finished *Papillon*, it's a good book."" ""Yeah, a great book. I really liked it. Where'd you pick it up?"" ""Um.. it's your book. I got it from your house?"" ""I vaguely remember."" (note: my dad is still working and doesn't have memory issues)

Again, that's it. No mystical significance to the item itself; I could've read any copy of it. But if either parent had died before I'd got around to asking about it, I'd have imbued the items they were indifferent to with all sorts of needless meaning. 

Moral of the story: if you're holding on to inherited items out of a sense of guilt or obligation, keep in mind the original owner might not have actually cared much either, nor want you to preserve their stuff like you're a museum or something",declutter,1641185913.0
Confession of when I was a “secret hoarder”,In my room I have a mini closet/attic type of deal. When I was 14-18 I was a bit of a hoarder and shopaholic. I always worked for my money but never saved it. In those 4 years I accumulated so much junk I never used and instead of donating it or throwing it out I would put it in the closet. It was bad to the point where you couldn’t walk in there. In hindsight I was struggling with my mental health. When I was 19 I decided to seek therapy and psychiatric help I got better but the one thing in my life that really bothered me was that closet. Sometimes at night I would wish that part of the house would catch on fire so I wouldn’t have to deal with it. I discovered a Declutter video on YouTube and made it a goal to clean that closet. 1 month and 50 trash bags later it was clean and I felt so proud. 3 years later I’ve managed to keep it clean I only keep my baby crib (eventually will donate once I move out) and a bin of winter/ baby clothes in there. Sorry for the long tangent but thought I’d share my success story.,declutter,1665155754.0

"Good old emergency declutter... if I don’t end up moving, my house will be cleaner and better organized than it ever has. Literally ever.","My partner and I live in a <500 sq ft home on a larger property, next door to a business inside a house that is on the same lot, owned by some old friends of my partner. Two weeks ago, we found out the landlord had an offer and was ready to sell the place out from under us, that he was coming by with a buyer inspection in one week.

Commence panic, the place is a wreck and some of these messes are literally months old. 

Fast forward, we’re not out of the woods yet, but the buyer inspection was canceled due to the business owners in the big house being like, “oh hell no” and making a serious counter offer. If they succeed they will continue to rent us this place until we’re *actually* ready to move.

In the meantime... I think I have cleaned things in single days that I’ve avoided for months. We’ve packed up a lot of extra stuff for now, took some hard inventory, made a big thrift store box, and threw out a lot of things simply because I hoard shit, but was able to critically think “do I seriously want to pack up and move this broken plastic shoebox/5 y/o comforter/misc crap”.

Dear car dealers: I don’t want a “free” t-shirt with your logo,"Two years ago, I bought a used minivan. After I signed the paperwork and got the keys, the salesman said, ""OK last thing: let's get your T-shirts!"" No joke, they had a whole bunch of shelves with T-shirts, silkscreened with the car dealer's logo, in every imaginable size.

I politely declined, and the salesman gave me that fake ""You hurt my feelings"" look which perturbed me. I mean, I had just barely spent thousands of dollars on a minivan, and now you're offended that I won't be a walking billboard for you??? Seriously, I'm happy to buy things that I actually need, like a minivan that won't lose power when the temperature exceeds 100° F, but don't expect me to provide free advertising for you.

Don't try to guilt me into storing clothes that I honestly will never wear. I have enough stuff, and I'm trying to reduce what I have. Don't make things worse.

(And for those of you who say, ""Just accept the shirt and donate it,"" I have some bad news for you. Nobody who shops at Goodwill will buy a silkscreened shirt with a car dealer's logo on it.  So this T-shirt will end up recycled/trashed.)

Decluttering: tried to sell them on ebay but gave up,"Hey I am decluttering my student room, which is full of books, dvds and blurays. I looked it up, an devided them into worth and nothing worth.

But it was so exhausting and after 2 weeks i sold like 5 books, 2 dvds and 4 blurays. I gave up and was about to toss them all out. Then I found out about rebuy (also a German thing) and that you can just pick out everything you want to sell (books, movies, electronics etc.) and they give you a price, which depends on the condition. So I did that, and voila:  they took like 300 pieces, I just had to send them (for free, they pay for shipping) all the stuff and the amount of packages is also no problem. I got like 800€ and got rid of them. I would probably get more if I sold them by myself but it would just take so mich time, and all of the stuff would be just sitting here in my room, waiting to get sold.

Struggling to declutter because of landfill-anxiety? YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT RIDWELL!!!,"**EDIT: PLEASE SCROLL TO THE PART ABOUT RIDWELL IF YOU WISH TO SKIP MY VENT**

I am someone who struggles with intense feelings of responsibility for my possessions and anxiety about contributing to landfill/general sustainability impact of my decluttering decisions.

The argument ""it was destined for landfill as soon as it was created"" does NOT work for me because, by sending something that COULD be recycled to landfill prematurely, you are increasing the demand for more of the virgin material to be produced -- which causes fossil fuel use, water usage, energy consumption, pollution, etc.

Because of this, my house has entered a sort of semi-hoarder state because it is SO DIFFICULT to dispose of things responsibly. I have a huge pile of styrofoam because the nearest drop off for recycling styrofoam is an hour away. I have boxes and boxes and boxes of old clothes because I want to sort them to go to a destination that is likely to use them vs trash them (so I will take the time to bring business-wear to dress for success rather than Goodwill). I have bags of old lightbulbs, batteries, and OMG the mountain of plastic bags in my basement. This doesn't even begin to describe everything I've been holding onto.

The effort associated with researching and then actually responsibly disposing of the various types of trash, plus the sheer volume of it all, causes me to try to optimize my time by taking as few trips as possible. So I spend a bunch of time sorting everything into categories. Then I burn out, or my depression flares for a few weeks, or maybe I have people over and need to quickly shove everything out of sight (ruining my organization scheme). Some way or another the piles sit and I forget my intent with them (I also have ADHD). Then maybe my cats pee on them, or mice shit all over them, so I have to go through the effort of cleaning the items. Then I set them aside and completely forget they exist, only to later have to re-find them and re-categorize/collect them. I feel like I am stuck in a perpetual cycle of organizing and cleaning, and relatively little of my hoard actually makes it out of the house. I've actively tried to de-hoard my home for like 7 years now, and while I've made a lot of progress, there is still a *long* ways to go.

I HATE living like this and I'm very consciously aware that I spend waaaaaaayyyy too much of my precious time on this planet dealing with trash!!! My husband and I have fought a ton about this, but I really struggle to break my moral code even though I know we're drowning and I'm destroying our quality of life.

**EDIT: HERE IS THE PART ABOUT RIDWELL**

Anyways, I just signed up for a service called Ridwell last night and I am LOSING MY FREAKING MIND. They do regular pick ups of hard-to-recycle items like clothing, plastic bags, batteries, lightbulbs, etc, as well as 1 roving category each pick up for other tough decluttering items!!!!!!!!!!! For example, after Halloween they picked up unused Halloween candy. They have an upcoming pick up for medical mobility equipment -- crutches, boots, slings, etc -- I LITERALLY HAVE A HUGE BOX OF MEDICAL MOBILITY EQUIPMENT THAT I HAVE HELD ONTO FOR YEARS because I felt bad throwing the items away, but had NO IDEA what to do with it. I'm so ecstatic!!!

This service is about to CHANGE MY LIFE. Every roving pick up, I can just Konmari that category and leave it on my porch. EVERYTHING that they pick up is reused or recycled. They pick up clothing each time, so they donate all the clothes in good condition and recycle ALL unusable clothes (provided they aren't soiled). I literally have so much guilt over sending fabric to landfill, because I know 99% of it is recyclable but don't know WHERE to recycle it. So I have a huge box of ripped clothes that I intended to mend before donating. Now I can just recycle them!!!!! This is a dream come true.

It's only $12/month for me. If you struggle with sustainability guilt in your decluttering like I do, please check them out and see if they service your area!!!",declutter,1667930669.0

Don't forget as you declutter your physical life to declutter your online life too! It's just as satisfying.,"Go through your subreddits and un-join everything that doesn't bring you joy (or do it one at a time as they show up on your feed). Could be ones you used to need for info or whatever and don't need anymore, could be ones that have too much drama/negativity, could be ones you thought would be cooler when you joined them and aren't actually that interesting. Free up your feed for stuff you actually like! 

Do this on Facebook and Insta and everywhere else, too. Unfollow (or unfriend) people who aren't an important part of your life. Personally, I use this rubric: if I saw this person in a crowded place like a mall or walking between classes at the university or whatever, and if they were more than 50 ft/15 m away from me, would I care enough to call out to them loud enough to say hi? Or would I avert my eyes and pretend I don't see them so I don't have to expend the energy? I unfriend everyone who doesn't pass, even if I used to like them. Humans aren't meant to have to hold onto 3,000 old friends from times past. YMMV, this rubric works for me but you might come up with a different one. Get rid of pages that make you compare yourself to them or that fill you with consumer-related desire. And hell, if you're feeling up to it, delete your profiles altogether! But even if you don't go that far, you can still clean it out. 

Get rid of old notes on your phone, clear out your Google drive, reorganize and merge and clean out your Pinterest boards!

"I declutter by reading others’ lists, here’s my list of 41 things this week (and why)"," I love reading through declutter lists to see if there is anything else I haven’t thought of and skipped over. It’s never out of competition, just that I need inspiration and tend to talk myself into keeping things. For this reason, I added small descriptions to show you how I talk with myself about why I’m keeping something I don’t love/use. 

Note: I was doing a maintenance sweep, not a full purge. 

This is what I decluttered this week:

1. The covers for my knives because they stay snug in their knife block and I have never used a cover, once. 
2. The extra set of measuring cups/spoons I’ve had since college. I don’t even bake enough and barely use them, I have others. I only keep these because it’s a full set
3. The food storage I have that isn’t glass. I never even use them for leftovers anyway. I kept them thinking I would use them to pack my lunch but the glass ones are easily accessible and organized so I have only used those lately. I never cook enough for leftovers.  
4. A cookbook I’ve never opened but was given to me years ago. The recipes are generic and can be found easily on the internet. 
5. Beer coozies I forgot I had, while I was at it found glass screen protectors for my old phone, old batteries, business cards I can google, and knick-knacks I don’t even remember (junk drawer gone!)
6. Pens I hate or were free. I have a whole pack of ones that I love, and I would have forced myself to use the one I hate others first
7. The guest towels that aren’t the right color scheme and because the guests I never have don’t need 8 towels for their one night stay lol. 
8. A few bags I thought I would use for groceries but everything always fits in my massive blue ikea thing 
9. A totebag that is really nice but I kept it even though I don’t even like it
10. Handheld graters because I got a stand up triangle one and haven’t used them since
11. A few fancy dresses that were given to me, aren’t my style, but I kept in case I ever went to multiple black-tie events?!?! (MINDSET: This is my “Fantasy Self” and someone I will never be. And If for some reason I am, she deserves a brand new black-tie dress)
12. A red belt I have never worn but kept it because of “Fantasy Self”
13. A plant with sentimental value that I needed to let go of
14. More Paper files (MINDSET: If I had to manually scan these in for an electronic storage system, would I even bother?)
15. A free tote from a conference (okay… a couple. I thought I would use it at work)
16. Some roaster pans I have never used- not even for thanksgiving or anything
17. Some sink faucets I was given that I didn’t use in my home, and don’t like enough to put in a future home
18. A few picture frames I haven’t bothered to hang (over 1 year) and don’t even really love
19. Some additional jewelry that are for my “Fantasy Self”
20. The baggies and boxes that come with jewelry that I keep in case I need to travel with them, but I have a travel case?!?
21. Fragrances I was given and kept because the bottle looks nice. Smelled them all and they’re actually pretty awful smelling. 
22. Throw pillows that are always on the couch but are scratchy (p.s. I don’t even miss them. I thought I would recover them but I want to make things easier for future-self)
23. Plant pots I don’t like but was keeping for a craft I’ll never do 
24. Unopened carpet cleaner that was leftover from previous owner. We replaced the carpet with other flooring. 
25. Excess Highlighters/ writing utensils I haven’t used since college 
26. Some winter jackets I have held onto but didn’t wear the past two winters
27. Nice winter scarves that have a cute pattern but I’ll never wear anything that matches the pattern/colors
28. Sunglasses that make my face shape weird looking (at least I think it does)
29. Shower curtain rings I kept in case mine broke
30. Books I read but would never read again/ use for reference
31. Hair ties I don’t gravitate to
32. Hair accessories I haven’t used since college
33. Unopened lotion I won’t use because of ingredients but was expensive
34. Facemasks for the same reason
35. Clear storage bins holding washcloths on a shelf the washcloths can just sit on?!?
36. Nail polish that’s off-brand and chips so easily, also duplicates
37. Coffee mugs that are cute but weird to hold/ never get used
38. My second curling iron (It was my back up even though I haven’t used my first one in ages either)
39. Facewash (I replaced it before finishing it, which left me with a lot of guilt for buying the newer product.)
40. Random notebook I have for random lists around the house. I don’t like it and I have another I actually use. 
41. A graphic sticky note pad to-do list type thing I use sometimes but it bothers me to write on

Note: I am more of a casual declutter-ing person (declutter small amounts of things as I live my daily life or reorganize a single space). I have never before been one to be in need of a serious purge, but it is always surprising to find things I have held onto for a while, and note how my mindset has changed. What I value has changed as I have grown, so I am working on not being angry with myself for holding onto things I loved/used 4 years ago. I did a declutter when I moved almost two years ago. This is the first time since them I really took time to evaluate what I had and what was causing my space to succumb to a bit of disarray. 

Since this declutter: 

* \- Getting ready in the morning is easier because under my bathroom sink is less stressful to maneuver around.  
* \- I haven’t noticed the missing “Fantasy Self” clothes/jewelry 
* \- I laid on the couch and looked for a pillow. I grabbed one that was a nice one and therefore never used – but it is so soft! And feels so nice! Worth the price for this, not to sit and look pretty. 
* \- It was easier to put my coffee mugs back in the cabinet, and utensils in the drawer after unloading the dishwasher
* \- I didn’t have to step over the old carpet cleaner heading to my washer/dryer
* \- I appreciated the less crowded plant space on my dining room and actually just looked at my plants for entertainment instead of just to make sure they were watered. 
* \- I was able to free up my junk drawer in my mudroom for my SO to put some things he did need space for
* \- I pulled out my trash can liner without having to move over extra tote bags
* \- My guest closet no longer hold my fantasy self!

I know these things all seem small but the day after, my day was drastically happier! Just about every corner/ cupboard was slightly easier to deal with. 

\*\*\* I am really proud of 35. I have always tried not to clutter my space with things that hold the stuff in my space. I had a three storage bins lined up on a shelf holding washcloths, hand towels and tissue boxes – all things that stack nicely on their own. There was no reason for the storage bins. And on top of that, I didn’t even like the color. 

Please read through and let me know what items of mine inspired you! I am genuinely curious (especially about 11, 14, 19, 22, \*\*\*35\*\*\*, and 41) Share yours because you might help me also – I always feel like I’m missing something I could probably let go of!

We had a great conversation!","We didn't make specific plans to act on the conversation- just kept it confessional, which I think was the right move- it kept us feeling free to be honest, without fear that the other would hold us to what we'd said.

It was interesting to realize how much unconscious bias I bring to decluttering. I struggle to get rid of clothes, old paperwork, unused kitchen tools, and the like, but some things don't even seem to enter the mental realm of possibility.

It was really good to just admit to each other that we'd like to be free from so much that we own. It was also super illuminating to hear his picks and name my own. Neither of us said ""Outdated clothes!""- even though clothes are bulky and personal and hard to get rid of, it turns out they're still pretty low-hanging fruit.

Then we asked each other what few items we'd save- we pretty much said important documents and irreplaceable musical instruments. Other than that- we feather our nest as lovingly as anyone, but it's interesting to think that it's all just stuff in the end.",declutter,1646349289.0
Getting wooden hangers really helped my clothing clutter.,"This sounds stupid, but I went to Ikea and purchased a few sets of those natural Bumerang hangers. They're cheap, but they look pretty classy hanging up in the closet. I originally purchased them just for the appearance and to homogenize the look of all my hangers, but I discovered aonther benefit: when I was transferring my clothes to them, they made me think about whether I truly wanted that article of clothing. It was almost like I was asking myself if each article was ""worthy"" of being on such a nice hanger. Especially because I only had so many of these wooden hangers, so they felt more... I guess limited? And I didn't want to waste them on clothes I didn't completely love? Has anyone else experienced something like this? It's so strange, but I'm really glad it happened.",declutter,1626044875.0
I came up with a morning and a night routine and it was a game changer.,"I was reading Marla Cilley's Sink Reflections and she talks a lot about routines.  She recommends a Control Journal to keep track of daily/weekly chores, menu planning, to-do lists, etc.  Sort of like a pre-bullet journal.

I decided to formalize my before bed and morning routines - I'm just starting out with bullet journaling so I got a graph paper notebook and made my lists.

I've got about a dozen little tasks I can do while my husband is taking his shower before bed.  I tidy up the living room, fold the sofa blanket, fluff the throw pillows, and put the remote next to the TV.  In the kitchen, I make sure the sink dishes are washed, load and run the dishwasher, wipe down the counters and stove top, tidy the kitchen table, get any fingerprints off the fridge and vent hood, lay out a clean dish towel.  Then I check our calendar and the weather forecast, prep my gym bag, and make a quick to-do list.  I also put a couple of denture tabs into the downstairs toilet because we have really hard water.  It all takes about 15 minutes and I'm usually done by the time my husband is getting out of the shower - then I take my shower and go to bed.

I tell my myself I'm trying to be kind to morning me.  

In the morning, I hang up our pajamas, make sure the laundry made it into the laundry basket, and make the bed.  The kitchen in nice and tidy from the night before so while breakfast is cooking, all I have to do is empty the dish drainer and unload the dishwasher.

Since I have a formalized list, I find myself doing things right away - I know I have to do it anyway so if I have a couple of minutes while the kettle is boiling for some Sleepy Time tea, why not tidy up the kitchen table or clear out the sink?  I'm more aware of what I want the house to look like before I go to bed so I'm less likely to forget or put things off.  It only takes a couple of minutes and it really is much kinder.

I have a cleaning day and a laundry day so I made a weekly cleaning list.  Since I'm tidying better, I can get almost everything done that I want to get done, but if not, I can see what I skipped and pick it up later in the week.

I'm still trying to figure out how to schedule and track monthly, quarterly, bi-annual, and annual chores but so far, so good.",declutter,1678762706.0
"Gave away a bunch of stuff for free on Craigslist...but instead of starving the landfill, I feel like I'm just feeding the hoarders (and resellers)","Most people are chill & polite & only express interest in a few items from my craigslist posts...but every so often, the proud new owner of my trash will roll up in a vehicle *filled to the headliner* with assorted junk. Which my junk then joins. If their car looks like that, I shudder to consider the condition of their house. 


This very afternoon, I walked away from an older gentleman in a chonker of an SUV, wondering if anyone is ever going to cook in my cast iron grill pans ever again...or if they'll just end up in a roll away dumpster after that man dies, and his kids chuck all his accumulated trash en mass. His vehicle looked like it had hit up every curb alert from Richmond to Baltimore. 


I have a separate post for clothes, and I regularly receive emails offering to 'take all of it'--even though the styles are wildly different. I just don't believe there are multiple size 0 women out there coveting my...denim punk-lite mini skirt from high school *and* practical work khakis *and* sparkly sequined bandeau top *and* a load of mismatched plastic hangers. 

Someone's selling this shit--which I wouldn’t have a problem with, so long as they actually wore & used whatever doesn't sell...which, let's be honest, is gonna be most of it. Instead they'll make a dollar or two off the best pieces & trash the rest--which is exactly what I'm trying to avoid. Landfill waste. 


Anyways thanks for coming to my TED rant. May your clutter find a forever home somewhere...just, you know, not my place 🖖

**ETA**: I'm getting a lot of judgmental comments (mostly from salty resellers) along the lines of 'wElL yOu BoUghT iT nEw soUltimatelyYouCreatedTheProblem sO StOp BuYiNg sHiT'

Yeah that's not what's happening here--a lot of it is stuff former roommates simply abandoned when they moved out (thanks Allison for dumping a 15 lb bag of senior dog food on me...I don't have a dog ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯).

Other pieces are 'gifts with purchase'. I buy most of my clothing 2nd hand, and I've noticed poshmark sellers in particular like to include little knick knacks. This is stuff I did not ask for & do not want--that's how the sparkly tube top landed in my closet. I suspect it was 'gifted' to me because the seller couldn't find a buyer. This is why I'm not particularly interested in passing off more clothes into the cycle of reselling--I'd rather just give it to someone who actually wears sequined crop tops.

Others are things that made sense in a past life--the cast iron grill pans? Made beautiful meals on the gas range in my old apartment. But I can't use them on a glasstop stove 😔. Same story with the khakis--used to be part of my office dress code, but I don't work that job anymore. The new job is less khakis & more Carhartt. 

My issue with resellers isn't profit or effort--it's wastage & the ecological impact of the Great Global Garbage Stream.

**I agree that resellers are providing a valuable service when the original owner simply wants to dump stuff en mass, dump the mental load & forget about it--but I already did the most labor intensive part: cleaning, prepping, measuring, snapping pics, drafting & posting an ad. This is not a service that makes sense for my stuff. The reseller is not adding any marginal benefit.**

I don't care if they make money off it; but the fact of the matter is, most 2nd hand clothes don't sell for a profit. The seller is eventually going to trash unsold inventory, and I think there's an even greater business incentive to trash inventory that cost them nothing to begin with. 

A lot of resellers are chiming in to explain that they donate unsold merchandise, but that's just [trashing with extra steps.](https://www.greenamerica.org/unraveling-fashion-industry/what-really-happens-unwanted-clothes)

"Inherited my grandparents house, hoarder mother won't let me get rid of anything","My grandparents left me their house and property after they passed away. My husband and I are overwhelmed to say the least. And for the record, I was ridiculously close to my grandparents and their deaths hit me *very* hard.

My husband and I lived in a 900 sqft house for 10 years and recently added a child who is now 2.5 years old. So we adopted a minimalist type mindset (not a true minimalist but we had to be very selective about what we kept in our house). My grandparents house is 3000 sqft and full of furniture and stuff. 

We don't mind some of their stuff and find a lot of the older things kind of awesome. What we want to keep, we have a spot for. 

But we're reaching a point that a lot of what is left we don't really want. We're packing the stuff up and putting it in our old house until things calm down (I'm currently 8.5 months pregnant with our second kid) but my mother is driving me crazy. She's expecting me to keep everything my grandparents had. An example: my grandfather was one of those decorative plate collectors back in the 80's and 90's. Their house had 217 plates on the walls. We packed up all but 13 because they are sentimental to me and they fit perfectly in an odd spot that we didn't know what to do with. 
My mother is insisting I keep A L L of these plates because ""they were grandpa's"". 

When I told her we didn't want to keep them and I was afraid they would be ruined in the extreme weather we have in our area, she was livid. She told me she wanted them. I told her fine. Although they will still get ruined at her house. She has nothing on her walls because you can't get to the walls. She has trails in her house because of her stuff, etc etc etc. And when *she* dies, guess who gets to go through it all? *Moi*.

Anyway.

I'm trying to tell her that we are keeping certain things that we like and that are important to us. My husband and I love history and genealogy and we are keeping unique things to make this house ours, like my great-great grandfather's tailoring tools and some blankets that were made by my great-grandmother and her mother in law, things like that. My husband and I don't mind and like I said, this house is ridiculously huge with lots of wall space. 

I know there is basically no reasoning with hoarders but Lord Almighty. Is there anything I can do? My mother has memory problems, but everything I want her to forget, she doesn't. She asked about some dolls that were packed away in some trunk that I haven't seen in 20 years and can't tell you where it currently is, but that these dolls needed to be pulled out and checked on and kept because they belonged to my great-grandmother's sister or aunt or something. Frankly, I don't give a damn about them. If there is a family member that wants them, I'd be glad to give them to that person but my mother seems to think our side needs to be some ""heirloom"" protector??? Idk. 

But I'm frustrated and lost. Sorry for the novel but I'm hoping to get ideas or ways to handle a situation like this.",declutter,1618189360.0
I converted clutter into cake,"Small win, but a win nonetheless! I had some vintage clothes that I purchased a few years ago but never wore. They were just taking up space in my closet.

"""Clutter is a Visual Sign of Procrastination""","I'm many years into decluttering so I've read a variety of resources by now, and I hear a lot of repetition of info/advice that I already know from most popular leaders the decluttering space. But, I just borrowed ""The More of Less"" audiobook tonight and listened to it while decluttering all of my old college and grad school work and was surprised to hear the author say that clutter is a visual sign of procrastination.

I guess it's obvious in hindsight now, but I'm on top of my work and other parts of my life that I feel are important to me and I've always been a stickler about time, so it's amusing that I don't see myself as the typical definition of a procrastinator. But, it's so true and fair that my clutter shows that I haven't valued my living space and that I've been procrastinating on upkeep there. Before the pandemic, I've always valued going out to staying in. Since I moved cross-country so much before, I never had a chance for clutter to really become an issue. My mom was a hoarder, so I valued not owning much when I was younger and loved the freeing feeling of moving easily. When I first moved to where I live now, I recall the first 3 years were still good, but once I realized I wanted to stay in my current area for the long-term that's when my possessions creeped up.

What's helping to keep me motivated to declutter is I'm passively planning to move to a different home within the same area in maybe 1-2 years, so I don't want the move to be difficult whenever it happens.

It's worth it - of all the stuff I've decluttered, I've easily only had to replace like 1% of it when I ended up needing it months or years later.

I'm so happy! I watched a ton of decluttering videos on Youtube for inspiration. They kept me going! Most of the tips, techniques, and psychology discussed in the videos were common sense, nothing I hadn't heard before, and nothing new, but there was one method described in a video that really struck me. 

The woman in the video started by saying \[I'm summarizing\], ""Imagine you're in school and you have one teacher who keeps assigning you massive amounts of homework. Every day, there's more and more and to make it worse, most of it is busy work. None of it is that important or worth doing! You don't want to do it, but you feel compelled to because your teacher assigned all these projects and assignments! That's just like all the items you keep in your home for all the projects you tell yourself you will do in the future, but you end up not doing them. You keep accumulating more items for ""future projects,"" but those future projects never get done. Meanwhile, the ""To Do"" list of items keeps growing and growing. Every time you look at the stuff in your room, you're reminded of all the things you SHOULD do, but aren't doing. You just had fun collecting the items and imagining doing projects instead of actually doing them. Meanwhile, your ""To Do"" list gets bigger and bigger, more and more stressful, and now you can't even relax in your room anymore because you're constantly reminded of everything you should or could be doing instead of what you *want* to do. It's time to let go of your To Do lists. Let go of the projects. Let yourself breathe and relax.""

Cleaning out my closet just saved me ~$45 in new hanger purchases,"Since I began seriously decluttering during the pandemic, I’ve payed more attention to my space and what I own, and my boyfriend and I decided that all matching wooden hangers would be a beautiful yet simple upgrade to our shared closet. We’re both grad students though and couldn’t justify spending $120+ just on hangers when the plastic mismatched ones we have work fine.

So, I counted the number of hangers we were using before we started to declutter, and kept tabs on them as we went through our stuff. As of today, we’ve freed up 45 hangers! We’ve been planning to get the 24-packs of hangers from Target, plus a few loose extras, so this just saved us at least $45 since we don’t need as many packs now. Plus, we gave away the newly freed hangers to someone on Facebook marketplace for free and they seemed really grateful. Win win! 

All this to say, if you’ve been thinking about hanger upgrades, save some money and do it after you clear out your closet! I’ve found that picturing my closet with nice new hangers has helped me be more honest about what I actually want to see on them.",declutter,1611849136.0

Moving: A cautionary tale.,"I tried to declutter before moving, I really did.  But I'm old, and have problems with my back, and wasn't able to get through all my stuff.

Anyway, I got really into audiobooks back when they were on audio cassette, and I ended up saving a lot of them when CDs became a thing, and then when Audible became a thing, because they just weren't available in those formats.  So tonight, as I sort through the boxes the movers packed, I'm going through those audiobooks, and I found two with post-its on them: one for my dad, and one for an old friend (because I knew they'd *really* love them).  The thing is, both of them are now dead.

Please don't be like me.  If you have something you know someone will love, give it to them right away. And keep sorting through your stuff.

"7 light pink nail polishes, none of which I liked or used","They all either applied unevenly or didn’t suit me, but I had a weird mental block about decluttering them. Yesterday I was paring down my cosmetics to fit in my new, smaller vanity. I wanted to store all my nail polishes in a particular small tray, and needed to get rid of at least four or five bottles for that to happen. 

While trying to decide which of my three green polishes— all of which I love and wear regularly— I should toss, I realized that I was operating under an irrational subconscious belief that one must have at least one version of each major sensible color if one wants three versions of a niche shade. I felt like I couldn’t rationalize having multiple “impractical” greens without having a respectable, “practical” blush. So, for literal *years*, I have been hanging onto all 7 pink bottles because I, disliking them all, couldn’t decide which token to keep.

Turns out that you *don’t* actually need a bottle of light pink nail polish that you don’t like or use to justify having other colors that you do. Likewise, you can save the ice cream maker but donate the microwave if you want. You can wear those neon green, sequined, over-the-knee boots without owning a pair of plain black pumps. You can keep the antique player piano and the gramophone but get rid of the Bluetooth speaker. Hell, there’s no law that you must possess a couch when you vastly prefer sitting in your living room hammock. If THE sensible choice is not YOUR sensible choice, you can jettison the “practical” items and keep the “impractical” items.

"Inherited my grandparents extremely cluttered house, and I’m overwhelmed.","I had been living with my grandpa for the last month while his health deteriorated and a few days ago he passed. It was good for the both of us as the house I had been renting came back positive with asbestos AFTER renovations had been done, so obviously I had to move out quickly. Now it’s been decided that I’ll get to live in his house. 

He and my grandmother lived in the same house for 60 years and both of them were borderline hoarders. There are papers and books EVERYWHERE. Neither of them cleaned things so everything was filthy. The kitchen had almost no usable counter space despite it having more cabinets than I have ever seen in a single kitchen because they had every kitchen gadget imaginable. Grandpa had almost 30 mugs despite living by himself the past 5 years. Four drawers are dedicated just to dish towels. There is an entire room that had just a few feet of walkable floor because the rest was jam packed with hunting stuff and photographs. 

I’ve had to throw out so much because it’s been destroyed by mice and bugs, which has been killing me since normally I’m very eco-conscious. Countless heirlooms have been lost. I’m trying my best to sort out things to donate but I’m way out in the country and I straight up don’t have the room to have bags sit around until I can make a trip. 

Im so glad I have family here to help sort but we’re at a point where we’re all exhausted. Plus I’ve been having to work around my dad because he tends to hoard things too and he keeps setting things aside that “don’t need to go yet” or “could be useful”. It’s hard to deal with that while also trying to  figure out how to live here. 

Despite all this I really do love this house. I know I need to just give it time and cut myself slack, but I’m so uncomfortable at the moment with all the gross clutter. 

Mostly I just needed to vent, but how do I stay motivated while faced with such a huge task? I’m burned out but I need to keep going to make my area safe and clean.",declutter,1667685742.0
Time to say good bye to my skinny clothes,"So I haven’t been skinny for about five years (I was only ever skinny for a few years also, I’ve been pudgy most of my life). I’ve been trying hard to lose the weight with little to no progress. I saved all my favorite outfits in a box in my closet. But I realized even if I lost the weight I’ve aged out of a few of these outfits and most of them required me to lose ALL the weight and not just a little. But this pile includes the dress I was wearing when I first realized I loved my husband, the dress from our first date, the dress from my friends wedding. I told my husband all this and he said “I think it’s time to just thank it and let it go.” So that’s what I’ll do.",declutter,1620524814.0
"I decluttered 14,000 digital items within a few hours. Here's how I did it.","Tips:

1. You have way more duplicates than you think you do
2. Start small, set a small goal - 100 items, 1000 items, whatever works for you. Then, once you have the momentum, decide if you'd like to continue from there
3. You do not need 15 shots of the same tree at slightly different angles, just one is fine (calling myself out here)
4. Your mass dumping of photos means that you do not enjoy them, you do not look at them, because it is overwhelming. Yes, many are pretty, but you cannot enjoy them when you're overwhelmed
5. More photos of a memory does not equate to stronger memory, especially if they're at the same place, pose, or people
6. Take many breaks, drink water or tea, don’t forget to eat
7. Don’t strive for perfect (again, calling myself out here)
8. If you get stuck on something, move on. You can go back to it later.

How I did it:

1. Gather like-items into folders. Start with 1 folder, maybe even the ""documents"" general folder.
2. Skim the files, note the major groupings you can do - DO NOT BE SPECIFIC HERE - just organize them by overall topic (in my case I'm a recent graduate, so I organized my notes by class), I also organized my important money/legal docs into an overall ""legals and financials"" folder
3. Put them into the folders as best you can, if you note that one could fit in more than 1 folder just put it in one, whichever you thought of first: that'll be the one you check first if you ever need the file
4. Create another folder called ""misc"" for files that don't really fit in any particular group
5. Now that you have the overall folders choose one, and go look at the documents - again, just skim them
   1. Let's go with the school notes example.
      1. Do you intend to go to grad school? Would you like to keep that door open? If so, then you should save your assignments. Create a separate folder within the folder for these. Right now you are NOT choosing which your favorites are - you're just saving them into a sub-folder from the class. You can go through them later, if you wish
      2. You do not need your school notes - all those notes from ""week 1"" ""week 2"" were created for the course itself - which you have now completed. If you are done with your degree you will not look back on them again - those can be safely discarded
      3. You may or may not need your syllabus, if you choose to return to school later. HOWEVER you only need one copy - save whichever has the most recent date on the file, and discard the rest
6. For items like tax documents, etc. you should create separate folders and divide by year - this can be done in multiple trips if you wish, as it is tedious
   1. You can open each document to view the year, OR you can right-click and click ""file info"" - this will reveal the date it was downloaded, and if you've downloaded documents each time you filed then that date should line up with the year
   2. For contracts signed, terms and conditions, etc. these should be put in a separate sub-folder for each - again, general grouping.
   3. If you signed documents for your employer create a folder for that job, and place them in it
7. Create another folder for general terms and conditions
8. Create another folder for product warranty info, etc.

Music

1. Music downloads are harder because they often do not have a photo, you may not even remember the songs.
2. Start with the albums you remember – do you have any albums you don’t listen to at all? Or any you vaguely dislike? Or any you were disappointed by? Get rid of them – you can always find them on Youtube or another streaming service if you wish to listen to them later (you won’t).
3. Now, are there any albums you bought that have songs within them you don’t like? Go get rid of those songs
4. Are there albums or songs you don’t remember? Go listen to them – maybe have them as background music as you declutter, clean, etc. – and decide if you like them. If you find yourself skipping any songs delete them as you skip them

Now, onto the photos

1. I put this last because it's the hardest for many people, if you'd like to stop at files, music, or even part way through any step I encourage it. Stop now and then through photos if you start to feel anxious, off, or like things are too much: be kind to yourself.
2. How many folders do you have with similar name? Go click on those, and skim the photos - be sure to have the viewing option so that it shows you a small photo as you scroll through.
   1. Do the photos in each folder seem to be the same? Or are they from the same general time period? If so go to one of the duplicate folders, doesn't matter which, and select all photos. Copy them, and go to the other folder to paste them
   2. There will be a popup at some point asking what to do with files that are already in the folder, for that click ""skip those files"" - any files that are not in the folder will be added, and you will avoid duplicates.
   3. Go back, and delete the old folder
3. Now, go back to the main “pictures” folder. How many loose photos do you have? Like the files, we’re going to group those into general folders.
   1. Once again be sure the viewing option shows the photos
   2. There are a few ways you can go about this
      1. Group the photos by person in them
      2. Group the photos by event
      3. Group the photos by year
   3. Create the general folder for whichever method you choose. Personally I did it by year. You can create a sub-folder for the event or person within the year folder if you wish
   4. Again, create a “misc” folder for any photos that don’t fit in any of the categories (due to unknown year, unknown person, etc.)
   5. As you go through these steps you may note photos you dislike, people you dislike, or duplicates – you can delete these as you go if you wish, but do not get hung up on them
4. Once you have organized the photos into general folders choose one and go through it, as you did with the files – skim them, do not view each individually.
   1. Do the first pass-through as a general overview, there is no need to be detailed – we are just removing stuff that jumps out at us
   2. How many photos of the same tree/person/etc. do you have that are the exact same but slightly different angles? Pick one, get rid of the rest of the duplicates
   3. Are there any photos that immediately leave a bad taste in your mouth or make you feel uncomfortable? Get rid of them
   4. Are there any photos you do not want but you’re keeping because you think someone else will want them? Send them by email, text, whatever now. Then, delete them.
   5. Are there photos you want and think someone else would like to have? Copy them into an email and, send them to them now – if there’s duplicates after sending the photos delete those and keep a few, you know you have access to them through the other person if you really want one of the other duplicates (you won’t).
5. Move onto another folder, do the same – remember this is just the first pass-through, do not fixate on being perfect. If you cannot choose which photo of a duplicate to keep move on – you can come back to it later.
6. After you go through each picture folder as a general pass you can do so again, once again just looking for what jumps out at us.
7. Like physical clutter each time you go through you will notice more items that can go

When you feel like you are done for the day, would like to stop, or know you must go to work/put kids to bed/make dinner take a minute to close all the tabs, and go to the recycle bin.

* Watch the number of files in there build as they load, and feel the weight of each of those files on yourself, on your shoulders, on your heart. How many gigabites is it? How much space? There is no need to find out.
* Picture those thousands of items as a physical pile, as clutter on your surfaces and your heart, take a breath, then empty the recycle bin
* As you watch the number of items in the bin decrease picture that physical pile getting smaller and smaller, your surfaces clearing rapidly
* When the number hits zero pause, exhale, and picture the weight you felt before lifting off of you as you release your breath.

Feel how light you are, and picture that horrible physical pile in your mind being cleared. Your shoulders no longer carry that weight. You did it. All those items are gone. You did it.

Remember the feeling of lightness, close your computer (after safely ejecting any USB or external harddrive you may have plugged in), and reconnect with your heart, that now no longer has that weight on it.

You may come back and do this as many times as you wish throughout your life, there is no right or wrong way to do this.

Always remember to be kind with yourself, don't forget to drink water and be sure to have something to eat.

What helped me see what clothes I really don't use,"This works the best for things like socks, pants, bras, t-shirst - things you wear the most, basic things. Also bedsheets.

Make a queue. Put all your T-shirts in the queue. After washing they go in the end of the queue in random order, and you pick the first one in queue to wear. What will happen is that you'll see you don't want to wear certain T-shirts or certain pants, because they aren't comfortable enough or don't fit you well, or the fabric doesn't really work for you. It's OK to think it was a wrong day for that specific item and put in back in queue. Next time you'll either like it or dislike it again. For me it's 3 dislikes in a row and I either get rid of the item or donate it if it's still in very good condition.

I'm that person who thinks that ""it's still good, I might use it one day"", ""of course I wear it regularly"", ""it's good quality, of course I'll use it"", and proceed to keep it for 5 years without wearing. And this way helped me see that I will not in fact use it and it's better to get rid of it now, not in 5+ years from now.",declutter,1685709912.0

It's crazy finding old items and work of yours that speaks loudly of the kind of person you used to be and what you believed in.,"First off, I want to say thank you to the community and everyone who supported me on my last post. I thought I was being too emotional and wasn't expecting much, but it really gave me hope in a really bad time in my life.

Anyways, day 5 of decluttering my room has been a very slow decluttering day. My heart and mind are very heavy today. I'm not feeling well at all. I've dumped many things in a pile to sort from two drawers and some room decorations.

Amongst the decorations I found a few items hidden inside of things. These items were from before a traumatic time in my life. Also, I found artwork and school work from around the same time and directly after. Everything speaks loudly about how much life and personality I used to have.

I used to be a free spirit. I used to feel so much and love so much. I believed in so much and stuck to my true self that I left everything to be a better version of myself. A lot has happened since and I couldn't pick myself back up. Everytime it felt like I was doing it I got trapped in another cycle. I feel like a muted version of myself now. I've had this feeling for years. 

Five days of decluttering has been like peeling back the layers of my life. It feels like a movie. It feels like the mess has covered up who I am and who I have wanted to be. I know there is more to be done to work on myself but this has really given me some good insight of my life and what I need to do to move forward.",declutter,1663885932.0
Stop storing things for other people,"**tl;dr Your home is not a storage unit for stuff that other people might not even want.**

We often store things for other people, things someone just might want in the future. Maybe it’s a tricycle and tinker toys for nieces and nephews. Perhaps it’s baby clothes and burp cloths for grandchildren. But here’s the deal: It’s all still clutter.

We store these things in totes and bins and boxes in our garages and basements and storage units until there’s no space left.  We haul our cache of maybe-someday-someone-will-want-this stuff from apartment to apartment, from house to house.

Now, this will probably make me sound like a heartless booger (which I totally am!), but stop storing stuff for other people. Most likely, no one wants it. And if you’re certain someone does want it, just give it to them. Let them store their stuff.  Let them fill their basement or rent a storage unit.

If this sounds unreasonable, try turning the tables. Imagine asking other people to store stuff for long periods, stuff that you might not even want in the future. Sound silly, right?

Your home is not a storage unit for stuff that other people might not even want!

**Take action**: Inventory all of the stuff you’re keeping for other folks. Each day, reach out to one of these people and ask them if they still want the stuff. If they do, give it to them.

Recluttering,"Thought I would share a story about recluttering. In 2017 my house burned to the ground. We (my husband, myself and my dog) had 15 minutes to get out with our lives.

We lost EVERYTHING. We managed to remember our passports and one file of important papers, but that was it. We were the only owners of the house, lived there for 20 years, and I had put my heart, soul, time and money into getting it exactly right. (A month before the fire I took delivery on the bed frame I’d wanted my whole adult life.) What’s really weird is that I had been in a decluttering mode for a few months previously, and I was cleaning out the linen closet one day feeling frustrated by all the crap that had accumulated in corners, cubbies and closets over the years. I literally stopped mid-cleaning and thought “Be careful what you wish for.” 

After the fire, we were in rentals for a while, furnished or with rental furniture and I knew immediately there was no way I would literally replace what we had. We were underinsured for one thing (a whole ‘nother conversation), and much of what we had was original artwork, textiles, and antiques that I’d collected over decades. The worst was the loss of photos, letters and other memories. I still get weepy when I remember some random little thing. 

The first recluttering was clothes (minimum needed), computer, toiletries, prescriptions and bed linens. As things have settled, I have the great advantage of knowing what worked and what didn’t over many years and I’ve focused in on things that I could use in multiple ways. Just a small example is buying a dozen white cotton flour sack towels. I could use those things for drying the dishes, washing the car, placemats, etc. And I still use them. Every day. They were $10 for a dozen and those things don’t die. You get the idea. So I made a sort of game out of questioning each purchase and it is truly amazing how little we really need. Many people generously donated things (that frankly were going to Goodwill anyway) and we’ve gradually replaced those. 

What I’ve also found out is that my husband is a jacket, backpack, and garage stuff hoarder. I had suspicions. 😉

I don’t really have a point I guess...just a counterpoint to DEcluttering. And the true value of the things we possess. Included in my evacuation kit now is a container with every card, and sentimental thing I own now. It’s not much but it’s on top of the box with lanterns, batteries etc. and goes in the car right after us and our doggo.",declutter,1619397561.0

Stealth Decluttering - how did you do it?,"I live with semi hoarder parents who discourage me from decluttering my own possessions. A couple people recommended stealth decluttering and oh, it’s been a bit of an exciting challenge. 

Every day I load up my work backpack with stuff to get rid of (think junky items, cardboard boxes, old clothes etc). 

On my walks to work I stop by and gradually empty out my junk at various trash bins and make a stop at a donation bin too. And at work I put my cardboard in recycling. 

I feel like a crazy person trying to be subtle in public but I find it successful so far - and kind of fun.

Decluttering your intake process is just as important as getting things out the door,"In the past I've found myself in a regular cycle of frequenting thrift stores, estate sales, etc. as a form of recreation, then donating a few bags back to Goodwill every few months. I didn't buy a TON of stuff, but I'd pick up little things here and there and get really attached to them, and then only donate back about 80% of what I'd bought, leading to a steady creep of items I couldn't really fit anywhere in my apartment.

This year, I've been doing a DEEP declutter, over the course of many months, and also doing some serious work to analyze the process of what comes IN. When I see something I want, I try to envision the full life of the object. Is it going to end up in a future round of decluttering? Is it going to be shifted from room to room and never quite find a home? Just because something is a great find or matches my style doesn't necessarily mean I need to take it home! I do not need a souvenir for every single trip to a thrift store.

We talk a lot about getting things out the door, but the other side of the coin is to not acquire things in the first place.

What they don’t tell you about the decluttering journey…,"The emotional strain of going through old things, debating on whether or not to keep it, and eventually getting rid of it. (I compromised for a “memory box” for things I couldn’t bear to toss) 

Spending your free time going through closets, drawers, and entire rooms. Feeling guilty for not decluttering when you could be. To avoid this, I make a goal for my day.. if I can get this one area decluttered, I can relax for the rest of my day off. 

Mourning the old you. Getting rid of clothes that don’t fit anymore, and things that you used to love that just don’t resonate with you anymore

Making a mess, just to not have a mess anymore. My bedroom looks like a tornado has gone through it. Piles for donations, piles of garbage, piles of stuff to hang back up, piles of clothes to try on to see if you still like them… slowly but surely my room is looking cleaner, but it truly does get worse before it gets better

My decluttering journey to minimalism has been exhausting yet the most worthwhile pursuit I’ve ever been on.

I took photos of products I used to love but were either old or empty. Some I looked up immediately and knew I could find them on Amazon, eBay, or even Etsy. I'll eventually start buying those products one at a time (if I even remember to!) Clearly I haven't thought about them in a while, so it's no big deal if I don't obtain them anymore.

So I kept the two I liked, donated the rags in good shape, tossed the grody ones, and bought a 10 pack of the rags I liked best. Now I have 12 dish clothes, and only the cute/functional towels in an amount that fit comfortably in my drawer!! No more cramming!

Finally got rid of most of my wedding decorations (small victory),"I got married a few years ago and bought rather than rented most of my decor.

So my spouse has been helping plan a fundraising event for the last few months. The other day he showed me the intended centerpieces for the event and they were very plain. It was a glass cylinder with a candle and some moss in it. So I suggested we dig out our old centerpieces out of storage and offer them to the planning committee (they are geodesic terrariums that can be filled similarly, very pinteresty). One thing led to another and soon our car was packed up with the centerpieces, table runners and chalkboard things (including a restaurant sized folding chalkboard thats just been sitting in my basement.) Well most of this stuff was a hit with the committee. So then they said ""okay we'll borrow this and that"" and I said ""no you misunderstood, you can have all this stuff and dispose of it however you want when you are done, all we ask is that you don't give it back to us.""

Listing house on Wednesday. Took 6 months but successfully decluttered ENTIRE HOUSE!!,"I feel like I can breath again!

Last night we had our realtor and stager come by the house to ensure everything is in order and help us with whatever staging ideas we needed. The stager turned to look at us in the end and goes ""Wow, this is very rare. I usually have a laundry list of suggestions for sellers. This house is ready to list immediately. I feel like I've wasted your time and the realtors money, this house is damn near perfect.""

I'm \*very\* good at hiding all of my clutter when we have visitors (thanks Dad!) so I can't really talk to many people about this, so thank you for reading. I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

I helped my mom declutter her pantry. Some takeaways.,"I helped my mom declutter her pantry. Here are some takeaways I was reminded of:

1. I could only help because she was ready to accept help. Emotion often trumps logic when it comes to her and her things but after I have been very supportive for long enough, she finally came around. 

2. It was her pantry, not mine. While I had my own expectations of what I would keep in/toss from the pantry and how to arrange it, I had to let her make these decisions herself. She just needed the willpower to clear them out entirely to start anew. Which brings me to the next point. 

3. It helps significantly when you remove everything from the space you're decluttering. Hard reset is the best way. You can take account of everything and see the empty space as a new opportunity. 

4. Decluttering is a process. We got a lot done today, but the jury is still out on what to do with a few things. It can't all be done in a day, but pat yourself on the back for the small victories. You should be getting more excited the more you work on reclaiming the space! ✌️",declutter,1660354822.0

PSA about Facebook marketplace,"This is not really a typical post for this sub but hopefully it's allowed -- I just wanted to share because I've recently finally started decluttering my house and getting rid of a lot of items that we no longer need. I started listing things on FB marketplace yesterday. And now, TWICE in two days, I've been contacted by people who asked to send payment by Zelle -- before even coming to get the item, first red flag -- and then I get an email saying my ""account is under limit"" and I need to ""create a Zelle business account"" for which I need to pay a few hundred dollars. Then they say they'll send me that money but I need to send it back.

Of course as someone who grew up in the internet age, this made all my spidey senses tingle and I googled it and it was a known scam https://www.gobankingrates.com/banking/mobile/zelle-scams-facebook-marketplace/ but I just want to let y'all know to be wary of this shit because a lot of people are scumbags apparently.",declutter,1675739537.0
"Does anyone else feel like what they're throwing away is ""sentient""? (For lack of a better term)","I'm an ex-hoarder. I say ex because I can successfully declutter my space, and I'm even doing so more frequently so that when I eventually move out from my dad's house I don't have much to bring with me. I no longer own a lot, I own a normal amount, but I'm in a small room so it feels like a lot more than it actually is.

But whenever I go through my stuff and throw things away, it feels like I'm insulting it. For example, I just threw away a Mexican Coca Cola bottle, that I got from Chipotle, the restaurant. It's nothing special by any means. It was just the first time I had tried it and it was in a cool glass bottle. But it's not like it's a memory from a vacation I took, or anything related to a special event. It's just a glass bottle that I thought was cool. 

And I felt horrible throwing it away. Same for old things I drew when I was a kid that I know I don't want. Same for shoes that are worn out to the point of not even being able to donate them, same for toys from childhood that are special enough to keep that I pack away in boxes, same for anything that's not literal trash that I throw away. Even throwing away broken things sometimes feels disrespectful to them. 

It could be due to spiritual beliefs of mine but it feels more superstitious I suppose. I just feel like I'm insulting these things. I threw away a bottle of lotion I didn't use anymore and was years and years old, and felt like I was insulting the lotion bottle. Donating items doesn't give me this feeling because they'll at least go to someone else, so I try to donate everything I can, along with all of the other reasons to donate things of course. 

Does anyone else feel like the objects you're getting rid of have some sort of sentience towards you and you feel bad for insulting them by throwing them away? I'm aware that these objects aren't literally sentient, so it's not really something I'm worried about, just a weird feeling I can't shake sometimes. I can overcome it luckily, I just wanna hear if anyone else has this.

Loss of an adult child and how to get started,"I lost my 24yr old son about 3 years ago and saved things from his childhood for him and in anticipation of sharing with his children one day. Toys, books, clothes, schoolwork etc. I made books each year of school photos and homework projects, teacher letters and have so many printed photos from growing up as well. I think things most parents would save but possibly more than average as he was my only child. I don’t like to call it clutter because they mean something to me but I know I can’t keep around. I have been able to sell/donate furniture and large items. I’m not sure how or where to start with the sentimental items. Every time I try to reduce I get stuck reminiscing and save things then stop. 

I’m moving to another country next year and don’t want to keep things in a storage unit. I don’t have problems reducing my things and have already made a list of what I’m taking. It’s his saved things I have difficulty with and struggle feeling some guilt and remorse. Does anyone else have experience in this and how did you go about, settle on items to keep, set timeline and get things taken care of. Thanks in advance for your advice.

Edit to add..
** I just want to thank everyone for giving such wonderful advice, words of kindness and understanding. Reading the comments of those who have had similar losses and the genuine words of support have brought me to tears. I came here looking for help taking on this challenging task and have received so much more. It’s something I didn’t know I needed and I greatly appreciate. 

My son was truly the light of my life. My best friend and the laughter, conversation, smile and love that filled my every day. I just miss him so much and have this hole in my heart with him not here. I know all his things don’t fill it and I appreciate your advice to get through. I’ve been working hard to accept, grow and learn to live on my own as I know he’d want me to do. I know he’s cheering for me and the progress I’ve made. I’m learning to love life again and live on in his spirit.

Im slowly getting out of my depression based dirty house.,"In the summer of 2020 me and my then fiance (we got married December 2021) bought a house trailer together. It was perfect and so easy to keep clean....until we switched from 1st shift to 3rd shifts in november/December of 2020. I hated 3rd shifts I was never able to clean and I was severely depressed. Fast forward to sumer of 2021 and my husband suggested I quit my job so I can work on keeping the house clean and taking care of our animals. I struggled to just do the upkeep while trying to plan how to tackle what seemed impossible to ever clean.. Well in the past two days I have washed the dishes (they were stacked up for almost a year because our oven broke and I didn't see a reason to clean our oven pans), almost totally (except what I used for dinner last night) and cleaned out our laundry room/bathroom of all the clothes that got ruined from our ac pouring water into our old room without us knowing and creating a lot of mold. I'm hoping tomorrow I can clean our old room and begin to make it into a storage room/ space for me to put my sewing machine so I can actually sew. Then I hope to finish the small things I have left to do and I can just do small upkeeping things, like dishes and laundry and deep cleaning once a week. I'm very excited!

A strange advice for those of us who can't control the urge to buy,"Buy a single expensive item. Lets say you want to blow 100, 500, 1000$ on dresses, because it's the time of the year, the mood, every dress you have is not the one, you know. You will spend it. You know you will (because I know I will even if I dont have budget). You'll try to fight the urge to do it but then you will. Then instead of getting 10 cheap dresses, buy freaking Teuta Matoshi or some other designer brand that fits your style. Spend the budget on one dress instead of 10. If you want a whole bunch of new aromatic candles - buy one, high quality candle. Or a handmade teacup from a small business.

You will feel better, you won't end up having a bunch of things you have no idea what to do with, and the thing you'll get will be high quality. And also it's harder to make an impulsive purchase of an expencive item and you have to spend time chosing the right one.

I don't know if this is the best plan - but it's working for me - thought I'd share,"So, I have ADHD, Depression, and Anxiety (the holy trinity if you ask me). With that, it makes it really hard to stay on top of cleaning, organizing, and decluttering. 

This past week I took a few days off work (which I'm fortunate to do, I know) and got some cardboard boxes from Lowes to do a deep clean of my apartment. 

The hardest part of doing a deep clean for me is to get side-tracked in the decluttering phase (i.e. sorting through stuff) and then I become so overwhelmed that I usually only do a room and feel bad about it later. 

This time though, I decided that anything that wasn't trash was put into one of those boxes I got, a to be dealt with later box. And I continue cleaning. It has worked wonders! I didn't get overwhelmed. I was able to remove the stuff so I could get to the cleaning. My apartment looks fantastic (minus a few boxes) and now I can go one box at a time, at a pace that works for me, to sort through all my stuff. 

So far, I have one medium box full of donations. ",declutter,1693234081.0
Flylady vs Mom the Hoarder,"I have said many times, my mom is a hoarder. She can purge, she just has too much stuff and it all has to be out or she forgets she owns it.  Probably about a level 2-3.

When the kids were little, Mom was on her way to hoarding up our house as well as hers + a two story two car garage and several out buildings. The amount of toys this woman bought when she visited for a one year old was INSANE.

I was a young mom, two small kids, and though our house was plenty large enough, the stuff was overwhelming me. That's when I discovered Flylady. Back in those days the system was very simplistic.  Clean as you normally would. Declutter in one zone a week.  Daily missions that included things we tend to overlook.  

But one thing Flylady said that I had never heard growing up was ""DON'T PULL OUT MORE THAN YOU CAN DO IN 15 MINS!""  My mom would empty entire rooms, wash curtains, wash walls, wash carpet. Then become exhausted and would go months before replacing items and when she did, it was just put it where ever  you can find a spot.  I really took the flylady system to heart. 

I learned if I wanted to clean out my dresser and organize, only do one drawer at a time.

If I wanted to organize the pantry, I only emptied on shelf at a time!

Slowly but surely I organized and decluttered. Kids grew and toys and clothes changed, but we kept a tidy home without the chaos I grew up in. (Mom is 82 and still lives in chaos, despite me trying to teach her flylady's system).

You see, Marla (aka Flylady) understood something my mom never did.  Decluttering is emotionally and physically exhausting!  So she taught me to break it up into small 15 minute chunks. No matter how tired I got, I could organize and replace the items if I only took out a small amount. And I tended to be more brutal that first  15 minutes than I was after an hour!

So I hope this week, you will break your decluttering into 15 minute blocks and have several successes throughout  your week over one big task that overwhelms you to the point that  you never want to declutter ever again!",declutter,1690732386.0

"My ""nice"" clothes sold for a total of... £13!!","After posting here about clothes I still wear despite not feeling 100% comfortable in them, I went through my wardrobe and got rid of most things that despite being in perfect condition just aren't my cup of tea. A lot of them went straight to a donation bin, but to satisfy that voice in my head that keeps telling me that these things have monetary value and I'm losing out by not selling, I attempted to sell 10 of the ""nicest"" items.

I grouped them into two bundles - the ""silk"" bundle with five 100% silk items, many by french and italian brands, and the ""linen"" bundle with five items from brands like ralph lauren and esprit. None exactly designer but they were my personal thrift treasures.

After photographing each item with their care labels and any imperfections, creating the listings, writing descriptions etc - each bundle ended up selling for a whopping £6.50, which I set as the starting bid. I now still have to find packaging, package them, write the labels, and take them to a post office. After that I'll have to update the buyers that the items have been dispatched, and then worry about the postal services losing the items or buyers not being happy and opening a case with me.

"I’ve both embraced, and let go of, my fantasy self","I posted a while ago about how I’ve embraced my fantasy self and started wearing the dresses I’d had, but not worn, for so long. Well, I’m still wearing them - I even wore the 50’s rockabilly to work, complete with net petticoat, because it was Christmas and why not!
This has meant that I’ve decluttered all of my previous ‘work’ outfits that made me feel frumpy and didn’t even look as smart as I thought they would. Fantasy me has become real me.

However, I’ve also let go of my ‘fantasy self’ in other areas of my decluttering journey. I’ve accepted that as much as I thought I’d bake cakes and cookies, or make dinners from scratch like I used to, new me doesn’t have the time, or the inclination, to spend hours in the kitchen. I’m not lazy, I’ve just embarked on a new path in life and that path doesn’t leave me much time or energy to rustle up a sponge or dozens of chocolate chip cookies. So I’ve cleared my cupboards of all the cake tins, cookie cutters, baking sheets and mixing bowls I’d been storing. My niece IS a keen baker and has been the grateful recipient of much of it, the rest has either been donated or thrown depending on condition. 

I feel so much lighter. My cupboards no longer taunt me and now I have room to rearrange the things I do use in a more accessible way. So no more kneeling on the floor (my knees aren’t as young as they were) to reach into the back for a jug. I’ve kept one loaf tin, with liners, because I do occasionally make a low-sugar chocolate loaf cake that is to die for.

I highly recommend doing the same. If you’ve somewhere in your house that holds items for that hobby you were *totally going to do* but never had the time for and now it makes you feel guilty, don’t be afraid to take those things and bid them a fond farewell. Find a local hobby group that will use that yarn, a relative who finds it relaxing to make delicious cakes, or ask the local school if they want any art equipment. Or just burn it all in an act of catharsis. Whatever works for you. Just don’t keep anything that makes you feel unnecessary guilt or shame.

"STUFF DECLUTTERED, STILL STRESSED?","Look at your obligations. Back in 2005 when I started my declutter journey, I was about 40, three kids, house, husband, dog, 2 cats, 8 million fish, 5 birds and I was overwhelmed to the max.

We began to downsize our stuff, but I couldn't figure out why I was so tired. So one day I decided to map my life.  I sat down with Outlook, which was my calendar of choice, and I began to map out everything I did in a days time. I started with the kid's schedules, sports, church, scouts... and then added in chores, dishes, laundry, carpool... then added in sleep, eat, etc.

It took me most of a Saturday to map out every obligation my family and I had.  I figured in every 24 hour period, I needed to work about 72 hours to stay caught up. My children needed to work about 48-60 hours a day to stay caught up.  Hubby was working about 60 hours a day to stay caught up!

No wonder young family's are so tired. Every time the sun went around the earth, my family had to do nearly 3 days of work!

So with it all mapped out, I started looking at what things didn't bring me joy.  Started with scouting. While I had loved it as a kid and it was my only extracurricular activity, my kids were pretty blasé about it and as the leader, I not only had to be at the meeting, but I also had to prepare for it, and also have a semi presentable house for the meetings. I resigned effective the end of that school year, which thankfully was within a few weeks.  I then worked my way through everything on the list and tried to remove anything that I didn't enjoy doing or the kids didn't enjoy doing. Sure we still had to do laundry, but we could get rid of other things.

When I was finally done, each kid was allowed on extracurricular activity per school year. With three kids, that's still a lot.  But something I noticed started happening:

On that night we used to do girl scouts, we began having family time. We could watch tv or play a game, or just hang out.  The kids started being less stressed. The house stayed cleaner as more stuff went out the door and I began to feel less overwhelmed.  As I removed things from the calendar that we no longer did, there were open spaces for us to chill, learn a new skill, eat dinner together instead of at the ball field.

It may not be stuff that is stressing you out. It may be obligations. These days, kids are grown. I work full time from home, so I can clean during what used to be my commute time.  But I have learned to not allow meetings and obligations fill up my schedule.",declutter,1673972106.0
[RANT] Feeling the effects of electronic planned obsolescence,"One of the few ""big"" purchases that I've made in my life is buying my first ever iphone in 2015 for ~$900. I got the iphone 6 and absolutely adore it to this day. It still runs perfectly fine. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it.

And yet it is becoming completely unusable in my day-to-day workflow and life.

Apps that I've been using for 6+ years are giving me the ""You need to update this app to continue using it"" error message. When I go to update the app it tells me ""you need iOS 14"", but the iphone 6 only supports iOS 12 and then there is no more support for it. You can't even continue using something as-is because it locks you out.

Learning that we’re just caretakers of stuff,"I have to say thank you & I’m super proud for a moment, I wanted to share a story. 

My mother isn’t a true hoarder, but she has sentimentalized many items she owns. About two years ago, she called me to ask if I wanted to keep a shaped cake tin from a birthday party of mine from when I was 5. I am almost 30, and have no children who are 5, so I said no. I begged her to declutter it, give it a new home. But today, she told me she just realized, does she own items she loves for her, or is she just a caretaker of the stuff in her home? With that profound thought, she has begun to give up a lot more items. My siblings and I have strived for years to convince her to get rid of items from our childhood that aren’t worth saving. And through our encouragement she has let things go. She is making a cross country move in a few years, so it’s imperative for her to downsize her home, now, so she has less to move then. 

So thank you for the encouragement & tips to keep me motivating her. Since I don’t live near her, all I can do is give her advice via phones/ facetime. So it’s been a struggle, but I’m so glad she told me about her realization today. It’s going so well!

Used my Thanksgiving visit to my parents to purge 90% of my childhood memorabilia.,"Bless my mom's heart, she saved so much of my childhood drawings, report cards, school pictures, toys....but I have been paring down this year and finally have my own house so I have room to take my memory boxes home.

I threw out 6 bags of trash/recycling (LOTS of paper) and a box of donate. Finally got everything down to ONE Rubbermaid bin (and two tiny boxes of photos and cards).

Most useful tip I found: go through and purge, then circle back and go through again. Once I had seen the whole spread of, say, middle school drawings, I could better gage which I truly wanted to keep.

Tell me your stories of decluttering memorabilia or high nostalgia stuff! Because man, it's tough but satisfying.",declutter,1638111615.0
Just a shout out and a virtual hug to this community. I hear a different voice in my head giving me direction.,"It used to be that I would look at the clutter and say, “Oh shit, I’ll never be able to get this straightened out.” Now, there is still the clutter, but now I hear the self talk that says, “Hmmm, what 5 things am I going to get to today?”
It’s still mountains of clutter and lots of mess, but now that internal conversation is different. Somehow, this community has taught me to be kinder to myself along with strategies for dealing with the mess. I just want to tell you guys thanks.",declutter,1619545296.0
"Dropped off a full car of donations today, then promptly broke into tears.","Forgive what is likely seemingly like a click bait title, I sat here for five minutes trying to think of how to concisely title this post / my feelings and had nothing. 

I spent the past week or so massively decluttering. It started with taking the Christmas decor down and I used that as momentum to go through other spaces. I’m so done with having so much stuff. It deeply overwhelms me. I made serious progress and filled my car completely. 

Including a dog bed and a giant squishmallow that my late dog used. She passed suddenly over the summer and I’ve left them there ever since. Partly because I couldn’t bare to get rid of them, and partly because I hoped our other dogs would use the space but they don’t go into the room they’re in. 

I understood they weren’t being used. I know it’s been months without her. I knew I’d never use such a giant squishmallow. I thought it was totally fine until I handed the stuffed animal off to the attendant at the store and he made a comment and I explained it was my late dogs. When I was done, I got in the car pulled into a spot and balled my eyes out. I know I couldn’t just keep it there forever. But it breaks my heart and it honestly made me feel so rude disposing of her things in this way. (A feeling I’ve never had when letting go of a late family members things…not sure what that says about me but I digress…) like it was a betrayal. 

Anyway, I mostly wanted to vent because I can’t really talk about this with anyone and it’s just been looming over me like a cloud all day. I’m happy with all the stuff I decluttered, but that broke me in a way I didn’t expect. :( I don’t know how I’ll ever deal with her toys.",declutter,1673410143.0
finally got the guts to sell my collection of video games that I've had for 35 years,"I feel like I just dumped a long term girlfriend

there was a lot of sentimental value wrapped up in a lot of the items

but I had to do it, these are things meant to be enjoyed and played with, not just sitting on some dudes bookshelf for decades, collecting dust and never being played

all the games can be played on emulators these days so its not like I can never play them again

Start with your kitchen table. Keep it completely empty.,"If you don't know where to start, or if you started decluttering and feeling stuck, empty your kitchen table or dining table. Tables are the largest horizontal surfaces in a house and they tend to collect all kinds of clutter.

 Remove everything, and try to find a home for them. Your goal must be ""nothing lives on my table"". No fruit ball, no napkins, no salt and pepper, no vases. It's remarkable how a clean surface is so soothing to look at.

 It's the same principle as the made bed. Makes the rest of the room look clean too. Eventually you will leave stuff on the table mugs, papers etc, but since nothing lives on the table it will be as easy to put away as is to leave them there. Try it for at least a week and see how you feel!",declutter,1639251117.0
I just donated 3 car loads of stuff and filled a skip bin!,"So this isn’t all that interesting but I wanted to share with people that might share my excitement about letting go of things and decluttering! It’s a bit of a read, I tend to ramble on.           
        
I’m pretty sure I’m a hoarder, I hang on to a lot of things for either sentimental reasons or because I think I can use it later. I’m 22 and I’ve already amassed a ridiculous amount of stuff.      
In the last 4 years I & my partner have moved house 6 times including interstate moves and we are about to move again (I don’t know what’s wrong with us haha).     
We’re currently staying with my parents so aside from everyday items, all of our belongings are in their garage boxed up.     
     
In all of these moves, I’ve been holding onto things for different reasons- because I could use it at some point, it’s sentimental, or just because I’ve been too lazy to unpack boxes. We’ve never fully unpacked in any of the houses we lived in except the first.       
So I’ve carted this stuff around from Queensland to New South Wales, to Victoria, back to New South Wales and now finally back to Victoria. It’s always been a huge hassle getting a big enough truck without being too expensive, and trying to fit everything in etc. but I’ve still held on to the majority of our things.      
       
But this time my partner and I got into the garage and cleared it all out/packed everything up in two days!! I finally let go of a lot of things I’ve been holding on to, and honestly I can’t remember most of what we got rid of.     
We also have toddler twins born in December and they receive a LOT of gifts for their birthday & Christmas. So there’s always a huge influx of things for them that time of the year. Going through it, there were a lot of toys, books, clothes (dear lord the clothes) and misc. baby stuff that they’ve outgrown so we donated it to the local op shop. (All in good condition, anything that was stained, broken, missing pieces etc. was tossed in the skip). They still have a lot of things but it’s more manageable now. 
I decluttered a few months ago and donated 7 garbage bags of things, but this time we were ruthless!      
I feel so much better, and the move itself doesn’t seem as bad- and I hate moving haha.      
I don’t want to unpack anything now that it’s neatly stacked waiting for the moving truck, but once we’re in our new place I’ve already decided I’m doing another cull.     

This sub has been a huge inspiration and I think what really helped me reach the point where I could let go of things, so thank you to everyone who shares their experiences here!",declutter,1615593554.0
"Another thank you, this time for professional shredding companies","I wish I had saved the original post where someone made the recommendation, so I could give proper thanks.

I'm moving next week after being in my place for 30 years. My big clutter nemesis has always been paper. Old bills, insurance statements, ancient tax forms, credit card offers etc. It just got away from me and now I am drowning in a mountain of paper. I tried to go through it all shred the important bits, recycle the unimportant stuff, but it was still causing my shredder to overheat and the recycle bin to overflow. It's so loud and time consuming.

Today I went to a professional shredding company with 3 banker boxes full of stuff and they shredded it all in front of me in about 3 minutes. It cost $20. So worth it. While I was there I found out they would shred my old hard drives. I think I'm in love. Especially when you watch it all be destroyed and don't have to worry about someone getting your sensitive info.

All that stress over the piles of paper, over in 3 minutes. I nearly cried in relief.",declutter,1611025815.0
In thanks to Freecycle.org,"In less than two weeks I will be moving from my home of 30 years to take care of family. It's an incredibly stressful time. According to my moving company I need to get the weight of my belongings down to keep it affordable.

I've been using [freecycle.org](https://freecycle.org) and making posts. Possessions that were heavy albatrosses, that I thought no one would want, have been flying out the door. Watching my pile of stuff, that I finally realized I can live without, shrink daily has been making me feel lighter. I didn't want to try to sell my belongings for a few dollars and wait for buyers, I just wanted things gone. So far, everyone I've dealt with has been kind and appreciative for the objects I've been letting go.

After years of accumulating, certainly things I have needed at the time, it feels good to let go. For all that, I'm calling it a success.

**p.s**. I can't find the original poster who made me aware of [Freecycle.org](https://Freecycle.org), but to you I say a big thank you. You're saving my sanity.",declutter,1610839316.0
That freeing realization: I just don’t need it anymore!,"I just want to share a victory with you all:

Yesterday, I was talking with my partner about getting a stationary bike. He said, “We don’t have space! We’d need to get rid of something, like your desk and chair downstairs.”

In that moment, a switch flipped. I realized that the desk, which I bought in 2020 to support my pandemic work-from-home lifestyle, had only been useful to me for one year. The desk essentially had become a two-tiered crap shelf: craft tools, pictures, office supplies, and mail just sat there. I used the chair as a drying rack, LOL! I never sat at the desk with any regularity since that one year, and there will be zero chance I return to working from home, given the nature of my career.

I listed both items on CL at a steep discount (sunk costs, baby!) and both were scheduled for pickup this evening and tomorrow.

We decided to put the bike upstairs and move a reading chair downstairs to the desk space. I get to buy a side table, and turn it into a reading nook! 

This is huge for me. I have not been happy with how cluttered the downstairs has been for the past TWO YEARS, and I know that removing the dumping ground will force me to take office supplies to work, and take care of mail when it arrives… and now I have a new cute little space to design. Oh, and I’ll have the bike upstairs! The reason this all started.

Lesson learned: don’t hang on to things that no longer serve me or apply to my lifestyle! And price things at the rate I’d like to buy them for used.",declutter,1672616864.0
"I let go of a few ""spark joy"" items - and I'm okay with it","Decluttered one of my kitchen cabinets today and despite the fact they ""sparked joy"" I purged two serving trays and a diffuser pitcher.  

The pitcher was bought esp. for me as a gift by a loved one who I care about very much.  They were so excited to give it to me because they picked it out following a conversation we had about using one and I mentioned I didn't have one.  Truth is I never wanted one, don't remember the conversation and despite liking the idea of one ... have only used it twice without liking the outcome.  But still the pitcher sparked joy because of the wonderful memory of this person putting so much effort into getting me the ""perfect"" gift. 

The serving trays were a yard sale find and they were ""perfect"" - right color to match my kitchen, themed shape that matched my decor.  I remember how excited I was to discover these and eager I was to get them home ... where they have sat ... used maybe three times in 20 years ... because, it turns out those themed shapes rarely match what I want to serve when I actually do host a gathering ...which is rare.  

Both brought joy to my life when they entered it.  Both still made me smile when I encountered them.  And now both can go forth to hopefully have a more useful life for someone else.  They were useful items in good condition that I liked - but I am at the point where I just don't want to keep things that I am only going to use once every several years.   

And now my cake pans and mixing bowls (which I use several times every year) fit better in the cabinet and I can get them in and out easier.",declutter,1667057701.0

Purging my fabric stash. Deterioration of items stored too long is definitely a thing.,"I decided that all of my sewing stuff has to fit in my sewing room and no more bins - every thing has to fit into drawers (Ladybug here).  It's a tiny room with an awkward dormer ceiling but it needs to be functional so that means enough space to accommodate my cabineted sewing machine, ironing board, and a (gate-leg) work table.

Tools were easy, I went through everything and kept the one I liked the best - even if that meant getting rid of the cool old vintage one :(  But life's too short to dig through a drawer of multiples trying the find the one I want.  Ditto hand sewing needles - I've been using the same needles in the same needle case for decades - if I lose one, I find it because I don't want it tearing up my furniture, scratching the floor, or stepping on it.  And so many packages of sewing pins - what am I keeping them for (besides the pretty glass heads)?

But I dreaded going through my fabric stash.  I've curated it so many times over the years - down to the ""really good stuff"" - but I still had bins and bins and bins of fabric.

It's actually been less painful than I expected.  Sort of like when I went through my clothes closet.  Any young or ""skanky"" fabric, gone.  Any muddy colors, gone.  Any colors that don't look good on me, gone.  If I can't fit it into a capsule wardrobe, gone.  Past-life fabric (so much suiting fabric), gone.  Ridiculous fantasy-life fabric (all that thai silk), gone.  

Even if I had a closet-full of Law and Order ADA power suits, I would never wear them.  And I'm not planning to drive 3-5 hours to go to the Opera.  And I missed my chance for tea with the Queen.  Where we live now, a clean shirt is pretty much dressing up - a knit dress is almost prom-worthy.  At this point, I'm more Steve Jobs, less Diane Von Fusterberg.  And most of my sewing is home dec anymore.

But the devastating thing, despite my best efforts - most of the gorgeous raw silk I lugged back from Vietnam in 1996 (I had to buy a second suitcase and pay an overweight fee!) - huge patches of sun fading!  Some of it is salvageable, but what a waste!  And I'm sure there will be others, once I open up the yardage to photograph.

I called my friend who makes beautiful couture clothing and we talked about fabric stashes.  We both have fabric squirreled away that we've had for decades - some of it inherited from our mothers!  And we've both worked around faded fold lines, more than once.  

We decided that unless we have an actual project planned, we're letting it go.  If we've got something we really like - let's figure out something to do with it now!  Even if that's just a TV cover (here's looking at you adorable ramen-bowl cat fabric).

It's better to spend a bit more on something ""fresh"" than lose something to time, sun, damp, mice, moths, etc.  You can make (and use) something now that may deteriorate in however many years, or you can hold onto materials that still deteriorate in however many years and have to throw them out, unused.

Besides, most of the fabric, I didn't even remember I had it!  Would I buy it again?  No.",declutter,1679327490.0
Decluttering snowball,"A therapist once told me we overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate what we can do in a year. I did a massive effort to get rid of 18 bags of clutter and trash (and counting) from the kitchen. As a result I’ve been cooking somewhat regularly. Then I cleaned up the master bed by putting away much of the piles of clothes into proper homes (thank you store that sells containers) and shifting the rest to the laundry. Not the ideal solution but a remarry space. After two weeks of sleeping in a clean organized bed, I sat around yesterday thinking that there is manageable bulk on the floor now - it’s not knee high just lots of strewn around paper mostly looking for a home. I put away the case of water blocking access to the front closet because I suddenly realized I had a home for it. I can finally get into the front closet to hang our jackets. Which will help debulk the floor some more. So it’s been a domino effect. As my senses stop being overwhelmed, there’s more piles of stuff I’m able to debulk and more piles I can make from the random stuff for future organizing. I still don’t have clear surfaces. Each time I clear a surface I find stuff lying around to put on it. Having a clear surface feels like a lie. Even having a clear bed feels like a lie so I haven’t been making it.Now that I’ve said it aloud…I think I’m going to get my brain used to a clean bed by making it everyday.",declutter,1675246282.0
I stopped supporting thredup,"Honestly, so much of what they do is shady I would gladly take even less if another company would do the same thing but with more integrity.

That means they stole it. It isn’t the first time. This one was just more obvious. 

The deceptive discount code practices and lying about clean out kits aside, the fact that they’ll claim to donate or dispose of something and turn around and sell it for themselves tells me all I need to know.

My brother's childhood decluttering story,"I grew up in a studio apartment that was about 600 square feet on a good day. Clutter wasn't really a *thing* for our family. We didn't have a garage or an attic. Space was sacred, and my brother, ""Danny"" and I had been conditioned from a young age to declutter, so even when we were kids, we hardly ever came home with paper or trinkets or things we didn't need. This is about Danny, who although knew how to clutter, he had not yet learned the delicate concept of ""tact.""

One day after church, when Danny was about five, his Sunday School teacher comes up to my parents, looking quite upset. She asked woefully, ""Does Danny hate me?""

My parents looked at each other, confused. No, they reassured her, Danny loves you, he always tells us that he got to color cool pictures in your class.

""Then why does he always throw out the drawings after class?""

Danny's teacher worked so hard on making coloring pages for her students, but Danny was so good at decluttering that after spending Sunday School happily coloring,  as soon as class was over he would say goodbye to his teacher, throw the paper in the trash in front of her, and walk out.

That gave my parents a good laugh. They had taught him well. A little too well.",declutter,1612661253.0

8 boxes of stuff GONE after a breakup,"Just want to share a victory.

I've been decluttering since the pandemic but because I cycle/walk everywhere, getting it out of the house has been a problem. I did donate tons of clothes at a collection bin near my house (one load at a time on my bike 😖) but the tchotchkes and housewares were an issue.

Decided to finally tackle it for good and did an aggressive sweep of the house in February. I'm still healing from the breakup of a 12 year relationship and finally got to a place where I felt good getting rid of some of the mementos and other stuff that he'd given me or that reminded me of that time in my life. I was BRUTAL in my liberation of stuff. I did another pass of the house, gathered a lot of ""maybe I'll fit into this again"" clothes, shoes I hardly wore and never really liked but didn't want to get rid of because they were expensive, you all know the drill. Y'all. SO. MUCH. STUFF.

I only donated things that were something someone would want or could use. Grungy old clothes went in the trash as did anything broken or really beat up. I threw in a few really nice, valuable things like a Garmin watch that I'd replaced with a better model as a kind of thank you to the thrift store for helping me free myself from this stuff. I did not donate to Goodwill, I chose a thrift store in my city that directly supports our LGBT community.

Then I got on Taskrabbit to arrange someone to take the stuff to the thrift store and today was the day. As I shlepped the boxes to her car I felt zero regret. I felt only relief, like THANK GOD these boxes that have been piling up in my living room for weeks are finally gone. I can't even remember what the hell was in most of the boxes. I know I won't miss any of it. Totally recommend Taskrabbit btw! It's awesome.

Declutter motivation: remember that time you found the best item of your life at a thrift store?,"I'll never forget when I found my vintage fur shortcoat. I was ecstatic -- it fit me perfectly.

I looked up the designer and the store it was from closed for good in the 80's.

I took care of it for a long time, and don't have the coat anymore. When it didn't fit right I donated it back to the thrift store I bought it from.

I regret nothing! I'm embarrassed slightly but this is too funny not to share. (A wrapping paper confession),"There have been a couple posts and many comments about wrapping paper for obvious reasons.

I'm going to share with you something I learned tonight. Tonight I learned from this process - I regret nothing. 

I found a roll of wrapping paper at Dollar tree this year. I recycled my laundry hamper container of wrapping paper that was elves and santas and reindeer as well as in January of 2023. 

All those off cuts were gone. Those ""I can reuse it"" pieces I saved? Gone. 

In march I needed something for a retirement present. I am a dollar tree junkie (The mint chocolate cookies they carry are Girl Scout Thin Mints and are a problem) so I decided to pick up a roll there.

  
I found something I thought was unique but also universal. It was dark blue with stars and constellations. It was PERFECT.

  
I have been using that roll since March. It has wrapped birthday gifts, wedding gifts, all kinds of stuff. 

  
Tonight I was wrapping up some last minute things and my DH started laughing.

""You have no idea, do you?""

What?

""Have you looked at that wrapping paper?""

Yes. It's constellations and stuff. Why? \*insert me being snarky\* Are you saying my dear Mother In Law is going to think I'm evil because I gave her a Christmas present wrapped in a constellation map and that means I am going to hell because Zodiac symbols are pagan? 

""No. I'm telling you to look at the constellations. Look at the connect the dots.""

Y'all. I looked at the paper. Yes. It's dark blue. Yes. There are stars. Yes. There are constellations. The constellations are?

DRUMMM ROLL PLEASE............. Dinosaurs.

I have spent almost a year giving gifts wrapped in SPACE DINOSAUR STAR CHARTS

My word of advice? Chuck the Santa paper. Go for something quirky. It'll be the best decision you've ever made. 

Monday I'm going to hand my PITA MIL a plastic container with 32 different kinds of seeds so she can start a garden this spring wrapped in......... wrapping paper designed by someone who was really really really high at work. And I'm going to giggle because she'll never notice.

Decluttering = spreading happiness to others,"In the past few days, I’ve used the Craigslist free section to get rid of a few things. Having not really used Craigslist before, I wasn’t sure what to expect, but it was SUCH a positive experience. 

• TV/DVD player: Both were rarely used, 10+ years old, but in working condition. The guy who picked them up said he was going to give them to a friend in need.

• 30+ metal rods from an IKEA bed: had been sitting in my closet for years. The guy who picked them up said they were just perfect for plant stakes, and he couldn’t wait to get them in his backyard. 

• Camera: almost just “organized” this into an electronics bin… but realized I hadn’t used it in 10 years. The woman who picked it up was SO grateful and said she needed it for a project. She gave me a hug!

Not just pokemon cards, but whatever you have decided to hoard. For my nerds out there, cards, comics, figures, pops, etc. Whatever it is.... you don't HAVE to collect the entire set/series/whatever. It is OKAY to only keep only the ones that are your favorite, or of your favorite character. You don't need every character from the series/show/etc. 

I have a side hustle of professionally organizing a warehouse for a friend who buys/sells nostalgia driven things of this nature. When you see mountains and mountains of essentially plastic and cardboard... it stops to have meaning. And seeing this much stuff has made me want to declutter my own stuff even more. 

\- That RARE collectible.... isn't that rare... hundreds of thousands exist around the world... we have like 40 charizards in the warehouse right now. shit tons of pops, He-man figures, whatever nerdy shit you can think of... we've got dozens. Lol. Ariel doesn't have shit on us. But seriously, remember at the end of the day, the value the item has... most importantly is the value it has to you. Most of the stuff, even if it goes on E-bay for $10,000 is really not worth more than the plastic it's made out of... since THOUSANDS+ were made. 

\- You are no less nerdy for not having the entire set! It is okay to ONLY have \_\_\_\_ character's comics/figures.. you don't NEED to own EVERY SINGLE DC/MARVEL Comic ever...  You aren't any less of a fan... It is OKAY to only Buy Captain America.. you don't HAVE TO BUY BUCKY too.... or okay to love JUST Batman and the joker... you don't NEED to own every weird arch nemesis he's ever had all the way to calender man JUST BECAUSE there is a figure for it...

\- Spending the money to keep/buy/collect/store all this stuff becomes a burden... so only keep the stuff that sparks joy! The stuff that you really love to see/touch/look at/read. The stuff that brings you that nice dopamine hit every time you glance at it... not just when you get it because ""it completes the collection""

\- Getting rid of stuff you don't use/read/have on display also does not invalidate your love! (Ex. I loved Full Metal Alchemist, but I was never going to read the Manga again... and so I donated it... It doesn't mean I don't love the series... just that that medium wasn't going to be used) 

\- Sell whatever you don't keep! Or free on FB marketplace! Or sell to a store that sells vintage/collectible/toys. Google the closest one in your area, and make a few quick bucks (You won't get full worth, because they need to make a profit... but it will make getting rid of large batches easy and guilt free since the items will get a second life down the road!)

FOR NON-NERDY Items... This still holds!!!

\- YOU DON'T NEED TO BUY THE MATCHING SHEETS/PLATES/CUPS etc for a whole set. You are allowed to just buy 1 and it is OKAY

\- You DON'T NEED THE WHOLE MAKEUP SET, if all you want is the contour (colourpop guily anyone?)

\- YOU DON'T NEED TO have EVERY COLOR of x item.... JUST IN CASE. Just keep the 1-2 colors you like. (Sweaters. nail polish, shoes, whatever).

I hope this helped someone with whatever guilt they might have about collections.

GOOD LUCK! and PURGE BABY PURGE!",declutter,1624850566.0
Radical idea for inherited fine china,"I inherited an 8 piece setting of fine Noritake china from my mother in mint condition that she received as a gift from my uncle. The packing slip is still in it.  She never used it and I am not so sure it's been out of the box (other than when I opened the box myself), but here's the ideal that I'm starting to live instead of just saying it in my head.  *That china was made to be enjoyed*, and not to sit in a musty box in my basement.  I've been complaining for years that my everyday dishes are chipped, old, cracked, mismatched, etc.  I am in the process of moving/decluttering because we're moving to a house half the size, and I was thinking about how much money I could get for that china. Brand new, it probably cost the equivalent of a couple thousand, and I could probably still get about $400, but it's beautiful and it's such a shame that it still sits in a box with the packing slip from 1969, so it's coming with me to the new house and I am going to start using it.  

A set of new Corelle would probably cost me as much for all the pieces I have (including serving dishes).  As for the old dishes, the ones that are still in good shape will either be donated to my son and his fiancee (if they want them), or else to the local thrift shop that supports the local homeless shelter - the chipped ones will be used for target practice.  I consider it an absolute victory that I am going to use those dishes for dishes instead of letting them sit somewhere and be admired from afar.  Someone may be rolling in their grave that I'm going to put them in the dishwasher, which will probably wash all the metallic trim off, but oh well.",declutter,1631120464.0
"Mindset shift from the book, ""Decluttering at the speed of Life""!","I'm so happy someone shared ""Decluttering at the Speed of Life""  by Dana K. White on here. What a game-changer! 

The biggest take-away has been refining my understanding of a container. A container isn't just a cute jar you put pens in, or the boxes you use to keep your socks separate from your underwear in the drawer. The drawer is a container. A shelf is a container. A closet is a container. Your house is a container of containers.

When you start decluttering, she has you start from the most visible places from the entrance. She uses 2 boxes: garbage and donate. (No keep box!!!! What?! I'll explain later.)

1. Throw away all the obvious garbage.
2. Then as you go about decluttering, she doesn't have you take everything off the shelf or out of the closet. She just has you look through the area for anything out of place.
3. When you find an out of place item, you ask yourself two questions: 

* Where would I look for this item if I needed it? And then you just go put it there. Yes, even if you have to walk all the way across the house. You can do a quick scan and see if anything else needs to go to that place to save a trip. When you get to that place, if that container (shelf, closet, box) is already full, then you have to do one-in-one-out. What can you donate or throw away to make room for this new item?
* The second question is ""If I needed this item, would I even know I already had one?"" If not, toss it.

At first glance it seems wildy inefficient to take out of place items to their final place right in the middle of things. But it means that if you get distracted or interrupted, things are ALREADY BETTER and you're already at a stopping place. It means that you have a box of garbage (easy, just throw away), a box to donate (easy, just take away), and that the area you were decluttering has fewer things in it. 

It may not be done, but it is better. You left things better. And when you have another 5 or 15 or 55 minutes, you can leave things a little bit better. No more ""keep"" boxes to sort through. You haven't created MORE clutter. 

The other thing I love is the question: Where would I look for this if I needed it? Somehow it just simplifies things. Not ""where could I store this""? But ""where do I look for this when I need it""? 

And then the container concept! No more worrying about whether or not the item sparks joy, or has value, or if I might need it someday. Just a simple ""Does it fit where it belongs?""

Because at the end of the day, we can't just get more containers or shelves. Because our houses have a finite amount of space in them. But it's hard to remember that when we know we can just go get another container from the Container Store. The problem is that our house is already full. There isn't room for more containers!

So to solve the headache of deciding whether or not a thing has value or will be needed or sparks joy, we just ask, ""Does it fit here, in the place I would look for it if I needed it?""

And if it doesn't, then you have to decide which item you can get rid of to make room for it. That's a little easier for me. 

And the best part is that as you go along, you're making visible progress, which gives you more energy and motivation! Just wanted to share how awesome this mindset shift has been for me. Highly recommend the Audiobook. Makes great decluttering listening!",declutter,1629221413.0
"This is probably super basic, but figuring it out unlocked a Whole New World in simply existing in my space.","I don’t know about y’all, but I came into decluttering thinking I needed to sort and purge whole categories of stuff: my closet, my bookshelf, the attic, all the home dec, all the random electronic cords. And, YES! All of that is valuable and necessary.

But! It doesn’t *really* change the way you exist in your space. The solution to tripping over your entire family’s shoe pile at the front door isn’t *really* to only give them two or three pairs of shoes (though it can help!). It’s to change the structures around *why* the shoes are there in the first place. For me, it was the basic infrastructure around my front door, the flow of how people move through that space, and the training involved in getting them to pick up after themselves.

I hired a professional organizer a year ago to help me ([previous posts here](https://old.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/pubgl8/im_hiring_a_professional_organizer_for_the_next/) and [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/pzl5gt/im_the_lady_hiring_the_professional_organizer/) 

And, through that process, I started to see that what I *actually* needed was to identify the spaces in my house that weren’t working for me, and tackle the *space* rather than the category. The Kitchen doesn’t need to be decluttered. I mean, it does, but that’s not my main problem. My main problem is that the kitchen is at the top of the basement stairs so it becomes a landing zone for anyone too lazy to run a screw driver or a basket of laundry downstairs, and I’m stuck cooking over top of it. The *counters* are making my life miserable. So, what’s on them, and more importantly: why?

Cuz, here’s the other thing I realized (and, again, this might be a “duh” moment), everything that’s out is something that’s used and WON’T BE DECLUTTERED ANYWAY!! It’s useless to clean out a cupboard if the windex lives on the counter. I need to figure out why the windex lives on the counter, and not the cupboard. Maybe it’s because the cupboard is full, but maybe it’s because the cupboard is a crappy place for the windex and no one remembers to put it away there. Maybe it needs to live under the sink (now that the youngest can be trusted not to drink household cleaners), or in a basket on the counter.

Also, some of it is accepting that the people in my house can’t or won’t change and adjusting my behavior, or even the processes behind my behavior to be easier on me, circumventing them. For example, my husband is notorious for leaving out his coffee supplies, even though I’ve rearranged the kitchen (several times) to make it easier on him. So I bought a coffeemaker with a timer and now when I clean the kitchen each day, *I* make his coffee for the next day, set the timer, and put everything away. (Theoretically, it would suck, but I find in some ways my husband is less trainable out of his habits than our children or even myself is, so I pick my battles. And we’re less nagging-wife/man-child-husband-dynamic, and more partnership, since he reciprocates in ways I feel are equivalent.) Now the coffee stuff is where *I* find it most convenient. No decluttering was necessary for any of that, because I found my solution in analyzing the flow of the space, how people interact within the space, and the physical infrastructure necessary to affect them.

Last week, I set a soft, tall braided basket at the top of the stairs to catch all the stuff that needed to go downstairs so it wasn’t on the counter or underfoot. The cat looooooves it and sleeps in it when it’s empty. Do you know who noticed the basket was too full for the cat to sleep in and voluntarily ran the stuff downstairs to empty it for him? The person who put the crap that needed to go downstairs on my counter in the first place… less than a half hour prior.

Mmmwha-ha-ha-ha!

Anyway! Yes! Declutter and continue to declutter, but rather than devoting all your energy on (like me) a KonMari method, or emptying out storage bins you only access a few times a year, write down the spaces that stress you out (specifically, *which* corner, *which* table), and start to look at those spaces THEMSELVES and use decluttering as one tool of many you can use.

A cat tax has been requested! Unfortunately, I have not yet caught him in the basket and taken a pic of it. If I get one, I’ll update again! To tide y’all over, I have previous posts of my creamsicle I’ll link!

Is it OK to get rid of stuff if the person isn't alive anymore?,"I really don't want to sound like a horrible person but here goes 

My husbands Nanna unfortunately passed in 2020, her husband has said he's really struggling with her stuff being everywhere especially the kitchen and he'd like to just go back to basics because he doesn't know how to use half the stuff anyway. There is also some furniture 

Now my mil doesn't want any of it to go because it was her mums from when she was little. She has been told she's welcome to whatever she would like, she has had 3 years to help herself but her house is full to the brim with her dads stuff and anybody else that has passed and she seems to think I'm heartless wanting to get rid of her mums things. 

I intend to donate anything that I can, I understand loosing a parent is hard and I'm not going to pretend that I don't feel weird about sorting through this stuff but Nanna isn't coming back no matter how much we want her to.

I just want nannas husband to be comfortable, it was totally heartbreaking to see a 80 year old man totally break down and tell me he can't cope with the stuff and doesn't want to be judged by my mil. I've told him it's not like we're throwing nanna out and it's his house anyway.

"""If it isn't a clear YES, then it's a NO"": How to encourage yourself to let go.","
I have been browsing this sub for a while but never posted.

Someone here suggested ""The Minimal Mom"" YouTube channel, and holy crap is it mind blowing. Anyone who has NOT watched her channel should watch it. Her most useful videos are mostly the ones at the top of her list, after you sort by popularity. I will give the TL;DR of her long videos below:

In one of her videos, she says the phrase, ""If it isn't a clear YES, then it's a NO."" This one stuck with me the most and has really made it easier on me to declutter. Basically, if you cannot _justify_ why you still have something, then you should toss it or donate it. For example, let's say you have a bookshelf (like she does in her video). If you grab a random item off your bookshelf, you should be able to say ""yes, I need it,"" or ""yes, I am using it."" If not, then in the trash bin it goes or in the donation bin it goes. There is no ""but i will use it eventually."" That is not a clear YES. If you have not used it in a few months, you probably won't use it at all. But I realize this is sometimes easier said than done.

In another video, she says that if you _really_ cannot part with something, then grab a medium sized cardboard box (like one from Amazon or whatever) and put those ""idk if I can part with this"" items in there. Pack them as if you are going to donate them, but DON'T donate them yet. Just pack them and put the box somewhere — out of sight, out of mind. Make sure the box is closed, too. If, after a set amount of time (like 3 months), you never thought about the items in that box or looked for any of the items in it, then donate the box as is.

If you look for an item and it happens to be in that box, then by all means, take it out. But the rest of the stuff? Donate or toss because you clearly aren't using it.

If you want to sell your items instead of donating, then set a threshold. A $3/£3 item isn't worth trying to sell. Sorry. Set your threshold to something like $50/£50 or whatever you want, but be reasonable about it. If the item is below $50, then donate it. Don't bother trying to sell every sub $50 item, or you will end up keeping a lot of it while you try to find a buyer, and that can cause you to have second thoughts.

For memorabilia and other highly sentimental items, that is tricky and I have to work on this myself, but I hope these general tips help! I am really liking The Minimal Mom.",declutter,1697470576.0

I honestly don't know how to make my space serve me.

Decluttering (and cleaning) with ADHD is a pain in the a**...,"So today and tomorrow, I have tasked myself with cleaning our entire apartment before a (much needed) trip out of town. I'm talking floors, walls, and going through cabinets. It's easier to get my partner to ignore me tossing things if he's distracted. He doesn't care what I get rid of, mostly, as long as it's not his. (I might've put too much on myself here...)

Important to note, after conversations with my doctor, we opted to hold off on my medication until after vacation, due to, what I call ""the dip"". (When your ADD/ADHD medicine wears off, some go through a mood dip. Mine lasts about an hour to an hour and a half, and I'm right back to the perky self I am.)

I've been working on cleaning for a little over an hour and I. Am. Overwhelmed.

So I tried to start going through some cabinets and ridding myself of things. Let me tell you, I'm over it. I've already determined I will never have a ""Better Homes and Gardens"" looking space. But I'm really struggling today.

(Success and VENT) Decluttering and giving things a home is finally paying off but damn...,"I moved into a home 14 years ago with my then-partner and his mother. I came in with very few items and we had a baby. Years later his mother moved out leaving tons behind, also his brother had stored many things as he lived in an apartment in the city. Not even a year and a half after his mother moved out she moved back in due to health reasons and brought everything plus an apartment worth of new stuff with her. I had barely touched moving things around when this happened and only a few months later she passed away, at the same time I found out I was pregnant with our second child. I never felt like this house was mine in any way as it was full of family heirlooms, furniture their father built, grandma's kitchen table, and now everything his mother owned. I made due as I was pregnant and dealing with her passing and before you knew it our second child is here.

I had been doing small purges of draws and bins, always asking my (ex) partner what he could part with, and sometimes it could be a lot other times nothing. It has been 6yrs since his mother passed away. In the last two years, I have worked hard on redoing the bedrooms moving my kids upstairs, and pairing down items. Purging and purging and purging. I had to let go of items I just hadn't touched in years and teach my children how to as well. Their father is a borderline hoarder and in the last two years, he has come to notice how the clutter is taking away from his quality of life. He has finally started parting ways with family items that he never touched but took up tons of space in our home. We always ask other family members if they want it first.

I stared at the huge empty drawer/storage/organizer and thought, ""What can I put in it? I don't have anything to put in it. It's a good item, so surely I can find a use for it?"" I thought about shoving it back into my closet but had an epiphany: I didn't need it anymore! I could get rid of it! 

It's gone to the thrift shop where I'm sure it'll be bought quickly by a lucky person who needs it. It's no longer calling for me to put stuff in it. I won't be tempted to fill it by buying new stuff because I won't have any empty drawers to put them. I feel free!! 

Then it happened again and again. I had four tubs (about the size of a breadbox) also filled with items. All the items inside have been decluttered and I was left with four very well-made organization tubs. I thought, ""These are nice but... I don't... need them anymore???"" To the thrift shop they also went! I have so much more space in my closet now and I feel great!",declutter,1660138764.0
Mom’s Quilted Jacket,"Inspired by everyone’s work here I have been going after my garage with a vengeance. I have decluttered and donated sooo much. But today I can across a tough one. I found my Mom’s quilted jacket that she wore all the time when she was alive. I knew it was in there and it had been trolling around in my brain for a while. When I picked it up again this afternoon I asked myself if it brought me joy and the answer was only sadness. It reminds me too much of her - so I let it go. Poof. Gone. I have so many other things to carry and remember her by but this one was finally, set gently down. Phew! I am sad because I miss her so much, but proud I could do it. I know she would tell me to let it go and be happy. One item but it paves the way for much more. Yay me!",declutter,1615157582.0
How to stop the voice in my head that says “I could sell that”,"Every time I go to get something out of my house there’s this little voice in my head that says “I could sell that on marketplace!” or “that could be worth something!” and even worse, the semi resentful knowledge that if I take it to goodwill that they WILL make money on it, and it stops me from just taking all the darn junk to good will and being done with it.",declutter,1694182727.0
Letting go is so much easier after you've made peace first.,"I'll avoid the long story behind it, but today my college kid was moving into our front room.  In the area are a set of shelves that have been the ""toy shelves"" for over two decades.  Realizing his bed would be blocking access to them, I decided to take the time to declutter them first.

Things I learned/realized:

1) Although in my mind these were the shelves for toys we kept for the grand-kids - truth is there wasn't much ""toy"" on there.  No wonder they just head straight for the Lego bins when they arrive.

2) I haven't touched these shelves in a long time because I didn't have the ""time"" to declutter them.  Decluttering and cleaning them took less than 40 min total.

3) Having made peace inside myself with a few facts first really helped me quickly do these shelves.  

... I knew the top of the shelves was slightly damaged and it needs repainting.  I can do that later - for now just covering it with a festive cloth.   

... I made peace with the fact that the grandkids love the legos we have (entire bins elsewhere in the house) and aren't so little anymore (preschool/elementary age vs toddler).   So no, toddler toys hold little interest.  

... I made peace with the fact that toys get worn out over loving use - and that worn out toys need tossed, not preserved. They have a finite life and that's okay - I do not need to rehab or resurrect them. 

So with those thoughts in mind, I quickly tossed damaged puzzles, torn books and random pieces.  I combined and boxed those things worth keeping (domino set, books, dinosaurs, wood blocks).  I bagged up a few decent condition but not needed other items to donate.  And then after a quick spray and wipe - I was done.   Went from 5 seemingly full cluttered shelves down to 2 neatly tidy toy shelves and 3 empty, clean, ready for adult child's stuff shelves.

All in less time than a Christmas CD and with about as much stress as peeling a banana. Easy-peesy, away goes the stuff.

Posting mainly to remind myself that it really doesn't need to take a long time or lot of effort to get an area under control now, just because it USE to take me hours of time due to indecision, emotional baggage, etc.   I earned my proverbial black belt in decluttering and now I just need to use it.",declutter,1669494439.0
Looking for perspectives: how to make peace with the money I’ve wasted on stuff?,"The main reason why I fail at decluttering is remembering how much money I spent on some stuff (mostly clothes) that I’ve never used and can’t imagine myself ever using at this point. The amount is just too much to simply donate/give away the stuff. 

I’m luckily not in debt, but to think ~10% of my net worth is tied up in stuff and won’t yield any returns is discouraging at times.

Would love to hear your perspectives/advice. Thanks all.

Update: thanks everyone who chimed in, and the kind stranger for my first award. I loved hearing all of your thoughts, and especially the Konmari way of thinking about how my things have fulfilled their purposes. Going to read the book, donate some and consign some!",declutter,1640026441.0
Husband has started massive decluttering but just throws it all away. Should I go with the flow?,"I’m glad my husband has finally started embracing decluttering in a big way, but while I will take the time to donate, he just throws pretty much everything he doesn’t want in the trash.  Mostly his stuff, occasionally mine.  Most of the extra stuff in our house is his, I would say.  I don’t have a problem with getting rid of it- I’m happy about having less stuff!  But he has thrown away literally thousands of dollars of good quality stuff that could have been donated for others to use.  At the same time, it’s mostly his stuff.  And we have two very young kids at home so I don’t have a lot of time to organize pickups or drop off donations.  I’ve offered to donate his stuff and sometimes he just says no.  I have a parent who is a hoarder so I’m wondering if some of my anxiety about this topic goes beyond normal levels?  I just hate all the waste.  Am I wrong?  Should I just let it go in the interest of getting our house less cluttered at phase in our lives where I don’t have much free time at all?

Edit:  some of the items are high end, expensive.  We have the money to part with them but I’m 95% sure that a lot of it is stuff that thrift stores would be very happy to have ",declutter,1701964432.0
Dispose of your nail polish properly!,"This weekend, I had some extra time and decided to get a manicure and pedicure. While there, I had a come-to-Jesus moment where I admitted that I wasn't ever going to get around to using the nail polish I had at home. Every time I get my nails done, I just choose a polish they have in store, even when I schedule the appointment in advance. I'd honestly be better off throwing the nail polish away and using that drawer for something else.

But as I discovered, my city and probably most areas don't want you to throw your nail polish in the regular trash. Instead, you should take it to your local household hazardous waste center. This is a reminder that in addition to more obvious things like paint or batteries, check that you're disposing of used beauty supplies correctly!",declutter,1619634552.0
Slow progress is still progress,"I have been working since March to declutter my living space and get rid of unused and unwanted stuff. The amount of clothes I got rid of in 2020 has been huge. Recently, my living situation has changed, and I realized I still have too many clothes. I will be moving somewhere new yet again in about a month, and I want to continue to thin out the amount of clothes I have. My mother has accumulated clothes and shoes to the point where you could almost call it hoarding; random piles throughout my parents' house, some that haven't been touched for a decade or more...I don't want to become like that. I want to continue to cultivate a household and lifestyle that I can feel proud of. So I am happy to announce I am donating another bin of clothes and shoes this week! Remember, even if your progress in decluttering is slow, it is still progress and you deserve to feel proud of yourself.

EDIT: Thanks for the awards!",declutter,1613435813.0
r/declutter is joining the June 12th-14th protest of Reddit's API changes,"Consensus in the sub was clearly that we should do *something,* with substantial support for full blackout, valid points being raised about taking self-help resources entirely off-line, and equally valid points about whether this kind of protest has a real impact.

Our plan follows, and then the background for what's going on is below that.

## What is r/declutter doing?

* At 00:00 US Eastern time on June 12, we will go fully dark for approximately 48 hours.
* There is substantial talk among mods of assessing the situation after 48 hours and potentially continuing the blackout. Because some of our sub's traffic is from people having crises, I'm not comfortable with staying dark indefinitely. If there is a further protest, we will instead freeze content (no new posts or comments) so that visitors have access to help.
* The master decluttering resource list is backed up [here on Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/letsdeclutter/719603750919159808/master-list-of-decluttering-resources) because that was a lot of work and I don't want to lose it. Right now on Friday, June 9, I have no intention of trying to move the community to Tumblr or any other platform. I like Reddit and simply want it to function more fairly.
* When we come back, there will be a photos-allowed period to celebrate your decluttering progress during the blackout.

Because we have only two sticky spots, the monthly challenge will be unstickied for a while, and the weekend thread will be replaced this week by a collector for tips for dealing with common decluttering issues.

## What's going on?

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app permanently inaccessible to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from Apollo to Reddit is Fun to Narwhal to BaconReader.

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface .

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

## What's the plan?

On June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because we love Reddit, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.

**The two-day blackout isn't the goal, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.**

## What can you do as a user?

* Complain. Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a support request: comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/)
* Spread the word. Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join the coordinated mod effort at /r/ModCoord.
* Boycott and spread the word...to Reddit's competition! Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite non-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!
* Don't be a jerk. As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.",declutter,1686333808.0
"When companies are not making lasting products anymore, is buying for life even possible today?","The titanic brands and manufacturers are onto us. They don't make many lasting products anymore. Why sell you one thing that lasts five years when you can engineer it to fail in two? That literally more than doubles their profits! It’s getting more and more difficult to find those products.

 I think the foremost thing we as conscious individuals can do is pick items that are repairable over disposable. We can’t do everything the earth needs, but the earth needs everything we can do. Think carefully. There are no consumer magazines to accurately tell you what will last a lifetime. Here are some beliefs: Buy simple. Fewer moving parts in a product helps. Lifetime durability implies lifetime maintenance. Take care of what you buy. Minimize use. Buy strong products. Thicker chair legs may break less often than those that are graceful, but weaker. Buy products whose technology you are familiar enough with to be able to repair. Be gentle. Most items last longer with light usage.

Also, while a buy for life purchase often involves the trade-off of spending more upfront, price does not always indicate quality, and it doesn't always indicate the kind of quality that brings durability. It’s equally essential to not lose or abuse the item you intend to buy for life.",declutter,1645107227.0

Mind you, I never actually wore the stuff because at the end of the day I was too embarrassed to wear them because I feared I‘d look too fake and tacky lol.

So anyways, I‘m in Spain right now and it‘s my last day here. I saw a bunch of Calvin Klein, Gucci und Louis Vuitton stuff in some tourist areas and I bought absolutely nothing because I finally realized that I need none of it.",declutter,1646430362.0

Storage Unit & Shame,"I’m posting this as a warning, advice, insight—whatever. I escaped an abusive marriage (23 yes worth) at 40.
I rented a large storage unit for my “stuff”  until I “had a place”. 
That turned into 20 years—my re-marriage & storing more “stuff”—since I conveniently had a storage unit. 20 FUCKING YEARS. 
During that time, my ex-husband broke into it & stole my $4000 worth of solid sterling dinner service (antique patterns, very valuable) & my heirloom china. Broke my heart. 

It has cost me upwards of $21,000. Got that? $21,000 to store stuff I only see 1-2x a year.

If this isn’t enough to scare you, —you should be scared. It’s also incredibly shaming.

Anyone else struggle with the donation drop off task?,"I'm actually doing pretty well with sorting out what to keep vs what to get rid of. My problem is I'll have boxes of donations that just sit there for weeks. I've tried putting them in the car, but they'll sit there for weeks as well.

The problem is my local thrift shops have very specific hours and days they accept donations (10am to 1pm, then 2pm to 4pm for my local Goodwill for example) and then sometimes they don't have workers to accept donations even during those specific hours, so I find myself avoiding the chore. 

When I have boxes and bags piling up I slow down on decluttering. 

Before covid there used to be a pick up service locally that I used pretty often and it made things so seamless. I sure miss it!

Preparing for the worst,"Recently I have been really worried about a fire in my apartment. I get this way every couple of years but this year I decided to do something about it.

Yesterday that all changed. I went through everything and got rid of most of it. My important documents are now in a plain binder in plastic sheets so I can easily see everything I need from mine and my wife’s government documents, to the the love notes we have written each other, to the proof of purchase on our cars, even the pets health records. All of it is in one spot so all I have to do is grab it and get out. I’m feeling so excited and chilled out now about emergencies.

Letting go of old stories,"I moved in with my boyfriend a few months ago, and as a devoted declutter/minimalist I brought only my favorite/most essential things with me. Eventually, his eyes were opened to the imbalance in our stuff, especially in the closets/cabinets. He so eagerly accepted my request to help him declutter, and we have spent hours getting rid of clothes, books, kitchen items, etc. What a load off!

But the best transformation thus far has been decluttering his sentimental/childhood items. Discarding  things like tattered baseball gloves, unused bumper stickers to colleges he never even visited, letters from an ex-girlfriend from his teens...it's like I could see the transformation taking place. He's experienced a myriad of trauma from sports injuries, ambivalent relationships, dreams never ""fulfilled"", and he said that letting go of these things was like finally letting go of that little voice that clings to lost dreams and unhappy memories that he as lugged around his whole life. All of these old stories and conflict-filled chapters were put to rest. And now there's even more space in our hearts to bask in and enjoy together.

Just a little success story. I'm so happy for him, and so grateful that he has had an open heart to let these practices change his life and his mindset. :)",declutter,1624811519.0

"Finally decluttered my packed-full closet, and had an emotional moment of self-acceptance and self-love in the process.","I usually lurk on this sub, but today I finally got past my biggest stressor in terms of clutter- a closet we use as a catch-all storage area. I've been decluttering other areas of our house slowly over a long time, and seen a lot of progress, but this closet has ALWAYS been looming in the background. When I would picture ""finishing"" decluttering, this closet is what I would picture as the final step, because it always seemed too big to tackle ""right now,"" so I could only ever picture doing it ""later.""  Recently, I've been thinking a lot about this closet. Every time I have felt stressed about our clutter, this closet came to mind. Over the past few weeks, every other declutter effort I made felt meaningless in light of this closet. It had come to represent my personal struggles with clutter. It felt like the one area that would NEVER get clean. Today, I set out with the intention of 1) figuring out what was even in the closet, and sorting appropriately, 2) categorizing the sorted remains into tubs, and 3) finally decluttering the notebooks and old school books I had in there. 

Number 3 was a big step for me, I've decluttered many areas over the years and have never been able to let go of these old notebooks. I hold immense sentimental attachment to old school notes, in the same way some people hold immense sentimental attachment to old diaries or artwork.  I have ADHD, and had a lot of stress and shame around academics, particularly as a teenager. I would, as a high-schooler, get fed-up with feeling stupid, check out textbooks from the university library nearby, and hyper-focus on taking notes. Over and over and over. Every notebook I had represented my efforts to work past my own ""laziness"" and general feelings of ineptitude. Every moment of shame around school, and every moment of pride as I tried to work harder and harder to overcome it, was wrapped up in this unwieldy collection of notes. I graduated almost 8 years ago, and it took until now to be able to let go of those things. I tossed EVERY old book of notes into a trash bag (to be sorted into recycling shortly), as well as many other items I could never see myself parting with. An old report of my ACT scores here, an old certificate from my high-school debate team, there. This has been my biggest moment of sentimental letting-go, of releasing myself from the image I've always held of who I could be, and of accepting who I am as I move forward. It was a moment of self-love that has taken years of journaling, therapy, and growth to get to. And it all culminated with ridding myself of this clutter. It has left me feeling raw, but happy and proud. 

To my surprise, all of the remaining items fit neatly into categories, there was no need to put anything in a ""miscellaneous"" bin to be decluttered or sorted later. I labeled each remaining tub - one for Christmas decorations, two for unused office supplies, and one for table-top games so we can entertain company, and so-on. It went from a jumbled mess of who-knows-what to a labeled, accessible, organized closet. I can find our wrapping paper, blank thank-you notes, social security cards, checkbooks, and whatever else I need from in there. I have a whole pile of old boxes to break down, and all-in-all, about 3 garbage bags of trash/recycling. One closet may not seem like a lot, but it was everything I couldn't imagine even getting through, and today I conquered it, and I am so proud of myself.",declutter,1646277606.0
The 5 item game (a.k.a How I tackle clutter with ADHD),"I'm a Very Messy Person ™. My desks accumulate millions of things and it gets so incredibly overwhelming that I can't handle it. So I came up with a system that works surprisingly well. 

**Figure out your areas** 

In a bedroom, this might be your nightstand, your dresser, the chair in the corner, one half of the floor, and the other half of the floor. That's 5 regions. 

**Put 5 things away from one of the areas**

This is where the magic happens. You don't need to stress or beat yourself up. Just pick up the 5 easiest things to put away. The only rule is that they have to be put where they belong. You can count 3 pens as one item, or 3 items. Count them as you pick them up. No more and no less than 5 (or any other number you choose. Even 1 is fine. Just stick with it once you start). Don't worry about any other area until you're done. 

**Move to the next area and repeat** 

A piece of paper, a pencil, a cup, a lip balm, and a rubber band. Boom. Done. Move on to the next area 

**Cycle through the areas until there's nothing else to put away** 

**Why I think this works (for me, at least)** 

It's SUPER low pressure. Sometimes I count a toothpick as one item, sometimes I count a set of pencils. But somehow, it helps so much. As you cycle through, you'll probably notice things that will be easy to grab during the next round. 

It's also very rewarding to have these reasonable goals. You can make it a game. Set a timer for 15 minutes and see how many rounds you can do. Or set a goal for a number of rounds. I just do rounds until I'm bored. No matter what, you'll have a tidier space at the end. 

**Hope this helped you**

This is is the only thing that consistently works for me, so maybe it will help someone else. Also, if you have additional ideas, please share!

Edit: This is for items that have been taken out, and just not put away, so everything ideally has a place to go back to. 

I mostly use this in my art studio, so 95% of items have homes.

If something doesn't have a home, I will instead put 4 things away, and find a new home for the 5th thing.",declutter,1641164957.0

Priceline (drug store in Australia) accepts empty makeup products for recycling, so I spent the weekend emptying out the old products so I can get rid of them for good. I don't need 35 lipsticks.",declutter,1670752909.0
"Is it wrong to do a Swedish Death Cleaning on your teenagers bedroom, even if they say there very emotionally attached to their items your throwing away and put up a strong rebuttal.(Asking for my mom)","A few days ago I took a pair of my moms hair cutting scissors and she found them in my room. She also found my room was a mess so she took trash bags and bagged up most of my old toys and belongings that weren’t hidden away in cabinets. This includes my doll collection which I have been working on for years and am VERY attached to. She left some dolls and some other things, and left things hidden in closets. But most of my things which I care about dearly are in trash bags half will go in storage, half will go in the trash. She also made new rules like “I can’t have anything on my desk, nightstands or out at all” and she’ll come and inspect every day to make sure it looks the way it was after she cleaned half my stuff out. My room feels empty, sad and I want my thing s back a lot, or at least some of them I don’t think it’s fair to just purge a teenagers room of their valuables like that especially if they put up a huge fight about it. My room exterior is all white and looks completely empty (she even took down posters I drew as a young kid because she says they look trashy) is she in the wrong for almost completely purging all of my things, most of which I’ve had for years.

Update: I thought she was going to throw my stuff out, she decided instead just to leave it in bags in the hallway. Eventually we made a deal where I would go through everything, and make three piles. One pile to keep, one pile to go in storage and another to get donated or trashed. Also to make it up to me she went through the trash to get back a very large and special stuffed animal of mine that she had tossed down the shoot. She decided to let me put my stuff back on my desk and out and now she's lax about it agian. Bassically it's no longer a problem.",declutter,1649259870.0
I just threw away spices that expired in 2017 🤦🏻‍♀️,"I've been on a bit of a declutter kick lately as settling in for the cold weather means spending much more time indoors and I want the space to be welcoming. I went through my spice racks and I had more than half the spices--some of which were barely used---expired in 2017, 2018, 2019 and so on. Ack! 

Now it's not deadly but those spices likely have ZERO flavor and punch left. I was able to consolidate to only one rack with the overflow slated to go in the pantry since we don't use those much. 

The most annoying part is when you have to buy a spice for a recipe and then it sits there expiring for years and you never use it again. Sigh.

Donating…and knowing it’s just delaying its path to the landfill.,"I know most thrift stores are overwhelmed with stuff and end up just throwing it into a landfill or dumping it onto an impoverished country (which then hurts their local economy when people who make clothes/items there have no place to sell them)

Because of this, I hit a paralysis when decluttering/purging my home of the stuff I’ve accumulated.  I end up feeling guilty because I’m just contributing to our ecological nightmare by donating and know that *someone* could use it.

"Browse the ""wanted"" section","This may be obvious but it never occurred to me that I should also check out the ""wanted"" sections of freecycle/olio.

There's a lot of items which I don't even bother putting up ads for and feel like if I put them on the street in a ""free"" box they'd go untouched. I am talking old magazines with pages cut out for an arts project kind of thing.

Well last night I ventured into the ""wanted"" ads and who would've known it people want all sorts of things. I got rid of an old chipped mirror, a box full of packaging from an IKEA order (which I was holding on till recycling day), partially used up jar of loose leaf tea that we didn't like from a zero-waste store, and a half-dead plant that I was going to chuck into compost.

I just agreed time for pick up and put said items on the curb with a sign ""For Jane from Olio, pick up \~9:30pm"" and that was it. I live on a quiet street with no foot traffic, so this saved me lugging a ""free"" box to the main road.

As an added bonus there were zero no-shows, as I guess if people wanted these items so much they made an ad for them, they were more committed to actually show up.

My grandmother passed suddenly and I have inherited her very full home — everything feels sentimental and I don’t know where to start.,"My grandmother passed unexpectedly a few months ago. 

She was the matriarch of our family and very meaningful for me. 

Unfortunately towards the end her cognitive functioning was starting to go and the house went with it. She amassed many random items, her useful and sentimental items became totally disorganized, and general housekeeping went by the wayside. 

By the time we realized, it was not long before she was admitted to the hospital, and then we were too distracted to bother with the house of course. 

Anyways, she has very generously left the house to me. Even after everyone has come through and taken the things they’d like to keep, it is still absolutely packed. 

As in — there is barely space on the counter to cook dinner. 

But none of it is “garbage” it’s mostly items like cake pans and yarn and paintings she’d started and never finished. Things of that nature where I’m guessing she either bought multiples not realizing, or started new projects not remembering about the old ones. 

I’m the only family member in this area of town so have to tackle this mostly on my own. It’s driving me absolutely insane, quite literally, to live in such chaos (and not have room for my own things which are still in boxes in storage), but not nearly as difficult as it is to part with her things. 

Any advice would be really appreciated. Especially about making slow, steady, sustainable progress as “today’s the day I conquer this” methods have definitely crashed and burned for me.

Reframing decluttering as a “treat”,"Like a lot of people, I tend to feel a lot of guilt and anxiety getting rid of things that were expensive or that I tell myself might be useful in the future. 

A mental shift that has really helped me is thinking of getting rid of something I don’t like as a treat in the same way buying something new could be a treat. But instead of spending the money now, the treat is giving myself permission to get rid of something I don’t love or need now and to potentially spend the money to replace it, if needed. 

The other part of the “treat” idea is remembering the value of having a less cluttered space. I just got rid of a big picture frame that I had shoved behind a bookcase and found it really helpful just to take a step back and note that it looked a lot nicer and neater afterwards. This is my home and there is a real value to having it look nice and be a pleasant space!

I guess I got rid of the guitar my stepmother gave me which was my step brothers, but I literally do not remember anything I gave away. I remember the quantity of books and the quantity of candles in terms of box loads, I don't remember a single title or a single candle scent. 


It encourages me now because I no longer have fear or trepidation about giving something away or straight up throwing it out. The five extra bags of books I literally threw in the recycle bin instead of yet another trip to the seedy local Goodwill (not as nice as area, often closed, only open in the middle of my work day). Most of the books were weird cringe religious books that I bought during the lockdown when I lost my mind and became a fanatic.

When decluttering feels like finally admitting it will never happen.,"I just found this sub from the hoarding sub and was debating where to post this before settling here. If this is not the right place to post this, I apologize in advance.

I eventually want to write a thorough account of my story, of how I got here, and all the parts that came together to make this issue what it is… But for now I want to get this off my chest as it’s been weighing me down for some time. It’s been weighing on me ever since I realized it’s probably the reason I’ve felt paralyzed to even start decluttering.

Decluttering feels like giving up. It feels like finally admitting to myself that this part of my life is gone, that it will never happen. Throwing away all my homework, my supplies, all the things I spent money on to pursue this career - throwing it all away means finally admitting that I failed. I failed to do what I wanted. I failed to get through college. I failed to prove that I could make a living for myself this way. And throwing all the supplies away also means that if I ever decided to try again, I’d have to spend so much money to re-accumulate all these supplies. Waste. It’s waste at this point, with how much room its taking up. But it’s also that all of it has gone to waste. Amounted to nothing. Wasted potential. Nothing to show for all of this waste.

ETA:

I never, ever thought that this would gain so much traction and attention. I made this offhand post in a moment of vulnerability, feeling weak and alone. Never did I expect to be met with such love and acceptance — such genuine care from strangers. I know it’s so cheesy to say that, everyone says that on Reddit… But I am blown away. Suddenly my mess doesn’t feel so messy. It doesn’t feel suffocating. Seeing everyone’s responses and suggestions, or those who know how I feel, and those who are affirming me that this was not all for nothing. I want to give each and every one of you my sincerest thanks.

I’m going to respond to more people individually because there is just so much useful and genuine advice and information here, I want to thank you all so much. But I wanted to add this in case anyone saw it since I’m feeling so emotionally overwhelmed and can’t reply just yet.

I love this subreddit and this community. I wouldn’t have thought it’d be so emotionally receptive to my messy feelings and yet it was, and so earnestly. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart.",declutter,1669969394.0
I. Am. Down. To. ONE. Christmas. Tote!,"I just went through and decluttered all the holiday decorations that I just don't use anymore.  Tossed the broken stuff and donated the good-but-not-our-style-anymore things.  I am down to a single tote of ornaments and the box that the tree gets stored in.  

It's so weird to think about having so few decorations since I remember pulling out boxes upon boxes of decorations as a kid and even in college, I had probably 10 totes of decorations (I worked at a craft store so employee discount on top of clearance prices meant I overbought for a few years).  

Even the tree skirt got donated.  The cat would use it as a slip and slide and it was almost 20 years old and just not my style anymore.  I mentioned to my mom that I'm going to wrap a piece of cardboard with wrapping paper to make a tree collar that's less tempting for the cat (who generally leaves things alone except that tree skirt) and recycle it in January and she tried to convince me to keep it and store it while simultaneously complaining that her tree collar was so big and bulky and took up an entire shelf in her basement.    


While I have the storage room in a state of chaos from pulling holiday decor out, it's time to go through things again.  The last time I decluttered, I got rid of a few things but ended up with 2/3 full totes.  This time I'm going to condense and consolidate.  My goal this month is to have everything fit on the shelves with nothing on the floor in front of them.  It's a lofty goal but I think I can make great progress if I can get the rest of the family on board.  This storage room has been the bane of my existence since we moved to this house.

If I'm close with them I'll say this is too nice and I already have one of these, maybe you could use it. If they're not super close, I'll regift it to someone who would appreciate it!

Letting go of pet urns,"I'm an older lady and will be forced to seriously downsize before the end of the year. I'm definitely freaking out about how much I'm going to have to let go. But at the moment....

I've had cats my whole life and of course they don't live as long as we do. I have six good-sized pet urns and I know I have to give them up, but I am struggling with sentimentality and weird 'if I do the wrong thing they'll suffer for eternity' imaginings. (Which I know is messed up.)

Where do you put the ashes of indoor cats? None ever lived in my current home. I thought about a large park near me, but then thought, ""In real life, they'd have been terrified to be dumped out here."" 

I know - I *know* - that it really doesn't matter. They're charred remnants of dead animals and don't have any spiritual or mystical properties, but I still feel I have to dispose of them in some sort of respectful way because when I was growing up, pets were part of the family and that's how I've always viewed my own. 

Anyone have suggestions?

Edit: I am moving across country into a much higher cost-of-living area to help family. Lots of unknowns at this point, but I know I be forced to majorly downsize and am ruthlessly leaving behind everything I can because moving is super expensive. 
The six urns are metal, about 7"" x 5"", and they just sit in a cabinet. The oldest urn is about 20 years old and the most recent about 6 years old.

I will keep a small amount of ashes from each cat and put them in one urn or a vase or some other decorative item, then spread the remaining ashes somewhere nice before I leave.

Cleaning for you vs cleaning for guests,"One thing I’ve really worked towards is a home that is not only clean enough for guests, but just for the ones who live here to enjoy.

Do you spend more time cleaning for guests over cleaning for your family?
I know some things I never cleaned unless we were having company. Toys were left out for several days unless there was food or trash mixed in. And I usually change sheets for overnight guests. Plus bathrooms can always use a clean with kids. But I am talking house in general. 
Granted when kids a little, no matter how much we clean, there’s always a mess. :)
But to me, the point of decluttering and organizing is to make our homes easier to care for. To create less chaos. To give us a home guest ready. To give us a peaceful place to come home to, and yet still be a place we can enjoy.

Until today.

He lives near my dad, and my dad is sick with stage 4 cancer, and it made sense to finally come home after spending 4 years in another state.

So I decided to declutter.  We announced my move to family on Mother's Day 2021 I was coming back, with the intent of moving in October.  The move has now changed to early September because of my dad's health.  So here I am, all packed and ready for the U-Haul.

I've given 12 carfulls of stuff to the local donation center, trunk and backseat fully loaded.  That was the easiest way to offload a lot of my stuff without guilt.

Trashbagging it wasn't my favorite option but I think I probably tossed about 2 industrial sized garbage bags worth of things beyond repair or worth.

I like to flip items on Mercari, which started as a stress hobby when I was furloughed during the early stages of the pandemic April 2020.  I was stressing about paying for my move (U-Haul, hotels, gas), but figured I could do Mercari again and see what would happen.

And I did it.  I made a goal to sell enough to equal what the cost of my U-Haul + tow dolly would be, which was $887.00.  On July 20th I met my sales goal and transfered $954.40 out of my Mercari account.

And I kept going.  About doubling my sale goal, earning a total of $1808.35 before the move.  I just put my shop on pause today, so I can pack up my laptop and printer.  I just packed the remaining to sell items and was able to fit them in a small box.

You will be welcome to make other suggestions, as I'm 100% sure I haven't thought of everything, and in the past, sub discussions have *absolutely* changed my mind -- just be aware that you'll want to make a strong case for your ideas.

**Wait, what's going on?** The earlier blackout post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/145c8z4/rdeclutter_is_joining_the_june_12th14th_protest/). 

**Why are we now frozen?** r/declutter gets some level of mental-health-related traffic, so I am not currently comfortable with a continued shutdown of all access.

**Why aren't you just closing the sub if you don't like what Reddit's doing?** First, because the idea behind the protest was to *change* what Reddit is doing. Second, because my responsibility to this sub is to help it be healthy, safe, and productive, which means listening to its members. Third, because there is no comparable resource anywhere else (other than maybe on FB, which has its own downsides).

**Why wait until Friday?** It's a time frame in which (a) things might happen and (b) members stopping by have some warning that we're going to discuss it. Also, the sub usually gets higher traffic on the weekend, so waiting makes it easier to include more people. (Pinned posts lose traction after 2-3 days, as most people don't read in Hot mode.)

**What happens if you really don't like my POV?** If you're polite about it, nothing. This is a controversial issue. I'm not enjoying a situation where sub members may feel really negatively about one another! Go ahead and express negative feelings about any aspect of what's happening, just assume that anyone involved in this sub is acting in good faith.",declutter,1686708158.0
TIP- To Identify Those Random Things You Keep Saving But Have No Idea What They Are,"TLDR On Google, in the search bar there is an icon of a camera. Click on it. Hold your phone over the item.  Click the shutter button to search. It's very freeing

I use this to identify random unknown items that I find and keep putting away because I have no idea if it's important or not. Most of the time it is not. For years, I kept finding a brass filter I thought was for a car. It looked very important. I was not going to throw it away.  Then since discovering Google Lens, I decided once and for all to figure out what it was. It was an oil burner nozzle. A service man must have dropped it years ago and it looked important enough for us to save it. Out it went.

I had replied to another thread about Cables and  that I use it to identify some cables. I found one cable with the end that you plug in the device to be different that the current micro-USBs . Google Lens told me it is a Motorola cable. Knowing we haven't had a Motorola phone in many years, I knew I could toss it. It worked with other cables as well, but not all.

Play around with it.  It is fun, easy to use and so helpful in decluttering, especially if you have a fear of throwing out potentially important items. Most of the time, you'll discover they are not!",declutter,1675688460.0

buy nothing group win!,As I've been decluttering I've used my local buy nothing group on Facebook a lot! Today I posted an Eiffel Tower wine cork container and someone messaged me immediately. They asked if I had any other French decor that I was looking to get rid of. I did! I had a little painting that I got when I went to Paris in high school. I kept hanging onto because I felt weird getting rid of it but it's been in storage for almost 10 years so I offered it to her and told her the story of when I got it. She was thrilled and was so excited to receive it! She went to Paris almost 20 years ago but all of her souvenirs were ruined in a house flood from a hurricane.

It never stops.,"I have a husband who doesn't put things away, a toddler, and a constantly shedding dog. I am a messy person who is overly sentimental or has too many things ""in progress"" so I ""can't"" put them away. I work on this constantly. But it seems like no matter what, everything is undone as soon as it's done. I can putter around and clean up things, but things are out again soon. Dishes always have to be washed, the vacuum always has to be run, there's more shit on the table, my desk has too many cups on it. I'm probably one of the biggest givers on the Buy Nothing group, I bring all my clothes to charity, I greatly decreased all my hobby supplies, I help the toddler pick up as she goes, I don't buy ""stuff"" often, but it all just feels so pointlessly temporary. Hooray, I cleaned out the fridge...time to buy groceries. The table is clean... and there's all my husband's clothes that I washed and he dumped there instead of putting away. It's so hard to try when it feels like I never get to stop trying.",declutter,1664365592.0
Does anyone else regret getting rid of childhood things?,"Up until the day before yesterday, for the past 20 years our tool shed in our yard has been used as extra storage, packed full of plastic bins with our (mine and my parents') things. We'd been wanting to clean it out for years so we could actually use it for what it is, and looking through the 15 big bins we discovered most of them were full of things from my childhood - papers and homework, toys, and books. Hundreds of books. Most of it was stuff I didn't even know we had hung onto

I picked out a few things I wanted to keep, and the rest we bagged to throw away. A lot of the items were damaged either by animals or weather so donating wasn't really an option. At the time it felt freeing, to be able to say ""oh everything in this bin and that can go"", but watching the garbage men collect everything off of our lawn this morning actually gave me a pit in my stomach. Now I'm sat here in tears because I just threw my entire childhood away and I regret it. Now I'm thinking we should've just kept everything in the shed, because even though I had no idea all of those things were even in there before the other day, keeping them safe would've been better than junking it all. It's not like they were cluttering up our house, they had their own space

In the past this sentimentality kept me from throwing ANYTHING away, and only in the last few years have I been able to subvert it and not keep clutter and things I don't need or use. But sometimes, like today, it hits really hard. I feel like I've made a huge mistake. How do I get rid of this awful feeling?",declutter,1621294591.0
Life after hoarding: divorce edition.,"Hi all. Me again. I know some folks in this sub followed my various posts over the past several months, and so I wanted to provide an update. Now just waiting on the bureaucracy and legalities of the court system. Divorce should be finalized sometime early in the new year.

The cliffnotes version: Finally left my abusive husband, who also had a serious hoarding problem. We've gone through mediation. Since I was the breadwinner, my two primary concerns were having to pay him alimony, or half my 401K. To make a VERY long story short, I don't have to pay him a dime in alimony, nor a penny out of my 401K, and I was also able to negotiate for 70% of the equity from the sale of the house. 

For those of you unfamiliar with my story/circumstances: I was married to my abusive soon-to-be-ex-husband for nine years. In addition to being abusive and having a laundry list of issues (anger, excessive drinking, chronic unemployment, and financial irresponsibility), he also had a serious hoarding problem. We previously lived in a 4,000+ sq ft house. Even when ""we"" (read: I) prepared to sell the house, he barely lifted a finger, so the task of clearing out his 2,500+ sq ft of hoards fell on my shoulders, even though I was working full-time while also dealing with chemotherapy, monthly immunotherapy infusions, and recovery from annual surgeries for my autoimmune condition. I did as much as I could independently, but I did have to hire professional junk removal crews on several occasions, which was several thousand $ out of pocket. Costly, but worth every penny. I cried tears of relief as I watched them haul stuff away.

I found myself a lovely new (rental) condo. It's half the size of the former house, around ~1,200 sq ft, 1bd/1ba, so everything is very spacious. It's been the perfect space to start my healing from the trauma of being married to and leaving a hoarder. It's in the heart of the city, GREAT price (secured garage parking included!),  tons of amenities, floor-to-ceiling windows, walk-out patio, spacious kitchen with island, in-unit washer/dryer, walk-in closet, the whole nine yards. And best of all, it's CLEAN and TIDY and ORGANIZED! 😄😊🥰 My landlady is also amazing, and is like the big sister I never had. 

I took some much-needed vacation last month, too, and it was my first *proper* and *genuine* vacation in a decade. I visited New England, and then flew out west to attend a professional conference and to visit with long-time family friends. I was in a very dark headspace before the vacation, so getting away from the grind and stress of life made a world of difference for my mental health. 

I'm still in therapy to deal with the emotional fall-out of everything. Prior to going on vacation, I felt like an emotional yo-yo on an hourly basis. Felt like the crying would never end. Since coming back from vacation, I've been doing better. I'm still in therapy, and I still have dark days/moments, but I've made substantial leaps of progress in the past ~90 days or so.

What do I value more: the space or the item?,"I came across this framing question while watching “The Home Edit” on Netflix… Pretty much what’s in the title. 

For certain things, I value the item more than the space it takes up. I value my great grandma’s crocheted blanket more than the little chunk of closet space that would be freed up if I got rid of it. 

For other items, not so much. Awkward shaped foot soaking tub that I can’t find a good storage spot for? I value the space that is freed up when I chuck it more than I value that item.

I just thought this tip might help some people!",declutter,1683933994.0
My family is making me feel guilty over the stuff that I got rid of.,"I have had a real problem of letting go of things my whole life.  For some reason, I am a very nostalgic person, even though I haven't had a very good life.  I would hold onto things that reminded me of the good moments.  I always fear that nothing good will ever happen to me again, and I need to hold onto those moments for dear life because they're all I have.  Because of this mindset, I never let myself get rid of anything.  I still had clothing from 25+ years ago when I was a kid.  I had more stuffed animals than I knew what to do with.  Barbies that were missing body parts, even their heads.  I just couldn't throw away anything.  I would even keep the boxes that they were shipped in.  It had gotten to a point where I no longer had room for anything new.  If I bought new clothing, I would have to put it in piles on the floor because the draws were filled.  Then, the piles on the floor started growing.

Back in December, I watched a video, and the person said that if an item has been put away, and you don't even think about it anymore, than it must not be that important.  That really spoke to me, and I started watching more videos about decluttering.  I started slowing throwing things away.  I felt bad about it at first, but then it started to feel really good freeing up space, and seeing the piles on the floor going down.  Anything that was still in good condition, (other than clothing) I donated.  It made me feel better knowing that those items weren't just sitting in a landfill somewhere.  After awhile, I had gotten rid of nearly all of the junk.  There are still things that I just can't part with.  They mean too much, but I got rid of easily 85%+ of the clutter.

I was feeling really good about this, but now my mom and my brother are making me feel terrible about it.  They keep telling me that I got rid of my whole childhood, and I'll never be able to get it back.  They are really upset with me.  I keep telling them that I didn't get rid of a single thing that truly meant anything to me.  That it was just junk, but they don't see it that way.  I already have a real problem with anxiety, and I feel guilty, and regret everything else in life, so now they've made me regret this.  I had a major anxiety attack last Sunday night over it.

Did I go overboard with the decluttering?

Sorry that this is so long.

Trying to resell my clothes has surprisingly helped me avoid recluttering my closet,"Someone mentioned earlier how decluttering is an *ongoing process.* You do it once, and then you do it again and again. 

My biggest area of focus in declutterring is my closet. I stopped being “clothes blind” in 2020, and really tried to actively participate in my closet. I noticed all the clothes I never wore, and clothes I loved but didn’t wear, and even clothes I *just added* but hadn’t touched, as well as my obvious rotation. 

Taking out the “never wears” was easy. It was the ones I loved but didn’t wear or the ones I recently added that were difficult to remove. To me, they still had value, so I couldn’t just “get rid of them.” 

So, I tried listing them online to resell. 

And what I learned, is that it takes *a LOT of work* to go through the process. 

At first, I listed everything. Forever 21, H&M, items I got for $20 or less, reselling for around $8 or so. I thought they were a good deal. Clothes were in good enough shape. 

But nope, *nobody wanted them.* So they just sat. 

Eventually, I sold a few that were $9-12. And my return? Under $5. It was a waste of effort. 

I did have clothes that were more expensive, and I was amazed at how quickly they moved. It was surprising to see how buyers preferred getting the Lulu’s dress for $40 vs the forever 21 dress for $20. 

So, I reevaluated my shop. I removed anything that wasn’t going to give me a return — post fees — of at least $20. Man, did this fuel my declutter! I went from having a store of 100 items to just under 30. 

I learned a LOT by going through this exercise. 

For starters, realistically, nobody wants your junk. You got a new shirt for $8 and it’s still in good condition? Great, your ROI was fulfilled. YOU got to use it. You’re not going to get your full dollar back by reselling it, and whatever discounted rate you give it really isn’t worth the income you receive. Your time is worth more. 

Next, I learned that it’s better to have a shop of a few items than to overstock. Again, this is a hobby shop. It’s not my FTJ. I’m not trying to maintain stock, I’m trying to get some small ROI to feel better about the dollars I spent in the first place. So for me, it’s better to have a small shop that conveys *quality* than to list everything and cheapen my brand. (Lol, I don’t actually have a brand.)

Having this set baseline helped me get rid of *everything* that didn’t meet it. No longer was I hanging on to the forever 21 romper to resell for $18. It was going straight to donations. My stock was no longer taking up multiple bins in my closet. I felt free. 

This in turn, also meant that for the clothes I *was* reselling, I put *a lot more care* in the staging, description, and overall quality of their listings. 

Finally, and most surprisingly, I’ve become more conscientious of the items I *do* add to my closet. I have become more at peace that if I buy a cheap basic long sleeve shirt from H&M, whatever I use it for will be my only ROI. I won’t seek reselling it. It gave me what I wanted for the time I had it. But of course, I do enjoy having clothes that have resell value. And, those clothes are more expensive. What’s been surprisingly nice is my new-found slow approach to adding items to my closet. It’s more expensive for me now, so it takes more time in between purchased. 

I feel I have become more aware of my closet, inside and out. I have comfortably filled all the functional gaps in my closet, so I’m less motivated to buy things on a whim. The items I buy now are of much higher quality, and purchased more slowly. And I feel better not hanging onto something for its potential value. It either has value or it doesn’t. And it’s okay to let it go when you realize it doesn’t have the value to you thought it did. 

TLDR: most of your clothes don’t have the resell value you think they do. Accept the time you got to enjoy them as the full extent of their value, and then let them go.",declutter,1643473598.0
When You Declutter a Family Heirloom It Can Mean a Lot... to Someone Else's Family,"Have any of you found WWII relics in your parents’ homes? Here is a story to warm your hearts! Good luck flags (Yosegaki Hinomaru) taken from dead Japanese soldiers were a popular souvenir for US soldiers stationed in the Pacific during WWII.   
A traditional gift, the flag was typically signed by a Japanese serviceman’s friends and family, often with short messages wishing the soldier victory, safety and good luck. The Obon Society helps those who have these heirlooms and would like to return them to the servicemen’s families, providing the opportunity for reconciliation between families through the return of Non-Biological Human Remains taken during war. Good luck flags are often all that remains of a loved one who was killed in action and this is a way for them to finally ""return home.""

I finally cleaned my room. Feels good to breathe,"Me and my family jokingly say I'm at the beginning stages of hoarding, but I'm afraid of that actually happening in the future. 

I spent 5 hours cleaning and I got 3 trash bags worth of junk gone. Trash bag worth of recyclable stuff gone, and about a trash bag worth I'm giving away on Facebook. 

I finally let go of all the stuff I ""might need one day"", half finished projects, stuff I bought and didn't even end up using or needing. If this stuff was gone years ago I'd of forgotten all about it. It's crazy how much money I wasted on a temporary happiness from buying it. So many small things that added up to being a giant pile. I had little things stacked on top of big things, phone boxes going back to high school, stuff I took apart to restore and forgot about, all gone. 

My motivation was every time I found something I hadn't used or seen in years I told myself it had to go, unless it was truly sentimental or something I needed and lost. Thankfully there wasn't many instances of that. 

Happy to see this all go out finally. I already forget what's in the bags and hope to add more later!  https://imgur.com/a/YMCG17O",declutter,1673442926.0

"Please tell me it’s ok to declutter my collectibles by donating, instead of selling!","I started collecting Squishmallows just before the pandemic hit and it just went crazy from there (I think many of us had a pandemic purchase that we went overboard on). I love them and I still plan on keeping a good amount but I am overwhelmed by the size of my collection. I just moved and I couldn’t believe how many boxes, so time to declutter!

I’ve been doing great with decluttering and minimizing my life but I’ve been dreading tackling my collection. I’ve looked into selling them and I just don’t think it’s worth it… I don’t wanna ship it to people because I don’t wanna deal with shipping something that I wanna sell for so cheap and I’ve heard horror stories about shipping issues with squish, people lying about not receiving them, processing fees, etc, and I’ve never sold anything before.

I made a Facebook to use marketplace so that I can use local pick up instead, and I’ll give that a shot, but I can already tell that there are posts that are pretty cheap and have been there for weeks or months! So the idea of it taking months to get rid of a squish for really cheap doesn’t really help my decluttering mindset.

To be 100% honest I just wanna donate them. I don’t wanna sell them, and even my husband is ok with that. But I see so many people in the Squishmallow community trading or selling them, it makes me feel like I should too and if I don’t, I’m losing money. You know?

I think the money/purchase did it’s job when it gave me the joy when I first got them. And I think stressing over feeling like I have so much clutter and dealing with selling etc might not be worth the money especially because I’m not selling any rare or expensive ones (I wouldn’t make it expensive anyway because I truly dislike overpriced resellers)

Sooooo…. Apparently I need to hear that it’s ok to donate it so that I don’t feel guilty in comparison to other collectors lol it’s silly I know.",declutter,1654271048.0

Kid’s art,"I had a breakthrough this week. I’ve been holding on to 3 huge bins of my two daughters’ art work and journals for the past 20 years! (One is 21, the other 17). I am very sentimental and it’s been a struggle but I knew it was too much to hold on to as my husband and I want to move overseas. I’m also not one to be able to just photograph the art and discard the real deal. 

Anyway, my daughter wanted to help me this week in my attic purge so I decided to pass her a bin of her old art work. She easily got rid of most of it and I pulled out a few special pieces I wanted for myself. (The rest we left for my other daughter who will be visiting soon from her home in Europe.)

My mom is an aspiring hoarder that works at Dollar Tree,"Hello all. I just wanted some advice to declutter my space. I haven’t lived with my mom for 5+ years but she’s still nearby and in my life. To compensate for being a sh*tty parent she gives me gifts. Too. Many. And it’s not ones with any meaning or value, it’s stuff from her work (dollar tree, obvi) that she finds would be helpful to me somehow. Christmas is the worst, because she’ll fill my “stocking” with loads of things from dollar tree that she finds instead of something I’ll actually want. From puppy themed playing cards to battery powered string lights that have purple poop emojis on them. I’m not kidding. I’m a 19 year old boy and this is the majority of gifts I get from her. 

I don’t want to sound ungrateful but she’s wasting her money and I’ve told her this year after year. I would rather one big present than a million small presents because in the end it’ll probably be less money anyways. 

The point of all this is that I don’t know what to do with it all. It’s taking up space in my already small room with no closet and it’s all in bags. I don’t even look at or think about any of it. Can I just throw these unused things away?

"Please, for the love of God - HOW do I use up tea?","Okay listen. Like 80% of millennial-aged people, I have collected a dragon's horde of teas. I don't know. The cozy packaging traps me.

I know I can de-stash. I do, frequently. But everyone and their dog around me has their own tea horde and if we make eye contact I just end up leaving with ANOTHER box of teabags. I got a hamper for Christmas from my sister that included a *kilo* of loose leaf tea I'm 99% sure she de-stashed herself.

Part of the problem was that I would forget about them because they were tucked out of sight (behind other teas), so I've moved them to a more prominent position, which has helped. I'm also always cold-brewing a jug in my fridge on rotation, which is a good way to go through several teabags at once. I have a thermos, and since I'm doing No-Buy July I'll be taking more tea with me to work etc.

But I'm looking for other ways to use up tea a little less obvious than ""drink it"". Since June's theme here was the kitchen/pantry, did anyone have any recipes involving tea? It's winter here so both hot & cold recipes are welcome. Any surprising non-culinary uses (other than dying fabric)? Any benefits to bathing in it? Because I could. I've got black tea, green tea, herbals, florals, rooibos, hell, even mugicha, and that's not even tea. That's wheat. I'm the only person in my house who can tolerate gluten and I've gone and put it in the tea.

I'm giving it away as the opportunity arises, and it's not sensible to throw out since I *am* drinking it (I have already gotten rid of any I know I won't). It might not be as pressing as other issues but I would love any tips on how to burn through it *faster* as I would love to organise my hot-drinks shelf some time this century.

Edit: Probably too late, but - to be clear, this is not an issue of how to *get rid of* these teas. Otherwise I would gift or compost them! No charity wants these old, strange, already-opened teas. I'd rather just donate a couple new boxes of more normal tea. But more than that, I enjoy these teas. I'm drinking these teas. They're *my* teas. I would simply like ways to enjoy them faster or at higher volumes so that I can move on and enjoy different teas at a more reasonable pace.

Edit two: Thank you for all the comments! I really wasn't expecting this many responses. I can't reply to everyone, but I wanted to compile a list from everyone's suggestions for anyone else seeking inspiration:

* **Bake with it.** You can incorporate tea into sweet recipes like cookies, scones, chocolates, flan, jello, ice cream, cakes, loaves, etc. by steeping the tea into milk/cream, replacing some of the liquid with strongly brewed tea, or by grinding the tea into a powder.
* **Cook with it.** Tea can be used to impart flavour in savoury dishes; make tea eggs, infuse meats, fish or tofu with tea, add dry tea when smoking foods on a BBQ, make chazuke, use half-tea half-milk for oatmeal, soak burghul or couscous in hot tea, and cook rice in tea instead of water (jasmine tea and basmati rice are a great pair).
* **Bartend with it.** Strongly-brewed tea by itself can be used as a mixer - especially fruity/floral teas like hibiscus or passionfruit - or turned into a tasty simple syrup. You can also infuse leaves into vodka or freeze brewed tea into icecubes.
* **Bathe in it.** Not a joke! Caffeine has some hair & skin benefits, chamomile is soothing on the skin, and tea baths smell lovely. Cold tea bags can be used as an under-eye treatment.
* **Cold brew it.** I steep 3-4 tea bags in a jug of cold water overnight. It's so easy, and it can often mellow out teas that are unpleasantly strong or bitter when brewed hot.
* **Deodorise with it.** Tea bags can be used to deodorise shoes, bags, etc. and can potentially deter pests, especially mint tea. Loose leaf tea can act as a potpourri.
* **Make kombucha.** If you can't find someone to give you a scoby, then you can make some from store-bought kombucha if it says it includes the live mother.
* **Craft with it.** Tea can be used to dye fabrics a subtle beige, or give paper an ""aged"" appearance.

In light of all the suggestions to ""donate it to a food pantry"", I would like to say: Please don't treat food pantries like a trash can for food you don't want. The teas I have left are already opened, and most food banks wouldn't be able to accept them, especially loose leaf teas of questionable origin.

Donations like this can be like sending ragged, unwearable clothes to a thrift store - it's just garbage the volunteers have to spend their time sorting through. Smaller, local charities may have more lenient rules, so it's worth asking them, but the only pantries operating near me would just have to throw it out. I do think there was a miscommunication somewhere in my post, because if I gave the impression that I didn't *want* my tea and was just looking for any excuse to get rid of it, that was not the case; but even so, if I don't clear out certain teas soon, I'm going to be offering them to local mothers' groups and community centres in case they can/will accept them.

Thank you again for all the awesome ideas! I'm gonna try a bunch of these - I'll be posting my successes over at r/noscrapleftbehind.",declutter,1656741567.0
Is it heartless if I felt a moment of relief when my parents' shed was flooded??,"I (27F) was very sad to lose photos of my family members who have passed away but my mom was particularly upset about a Rubbermaid tote FULL of workbooks and ""artwork"" from my pre-k/kindergarten years. I had no attachment to these things and was glad to let them go, made easier by water damage, but my mom had been saving them for me. I have to keep convincing her that I was no Monet or Michaelangelo at 5 years old and I don't want or have a need for things like that. My mom is a very sentimental person (when I still lived at home she would often go through bags of things I had decided to get rid of and be like ""awww why are you getting rid of this???"") so I feel bad being so apathetic.

On the brighter side, I recently decluttered their 3 bathroom cabinets and threw out an entire kitchen sized trash can full of things that have been there since we moved in (they've been in their current home for 19 years) and I think seeing all of the space in them has kickstarted her into getting rid of unnecessary things so that I'm not left to deal with them in future years. It's a slow process but she is getting better about letting things go that don't serve them anymore. However my old bedroom has become an out of sight, out of mind storage space so we are still working on it.",declutter,1665098797.0
My house is ready for close ups!,"After MONTHS of decluttering, tossing, donating, giving away, selling, and organizing to get my house ready to sell, I finished with hours to spare before the real estate photographer arrived. It looks beautiful. And clean. And tidy. Magazine worthy. All 3000 sq ft. of it. I really did have very nice things under all those overwhelming, mammoth piles.

While it’s never really “finished” as I still will have packing and likely tons more purging related to that to do (and not all the cupboards and closets that a potential buyer will open are totally tidy and the garage absorbed a lot in the final hours), it feels amazing. Afterwards, I crashed and slept harder than ever. The kind of physically and mentally exhausted nap where you’re not quite sure who, when, and where you are when you wake up.

Toward the end, the “should I or shouldn’t I get rid of this or that” became easier. The worst part is staring at those junk rooms full of nothing but things without a home and wondering how you’re going to find places/homes for everything. The tail end is much easier as it’s only a few things standing between you and utterly presentable. Much easier to make decisions then!

Gifts are great, but I don't like gifting handmade clutter to other people since I hate it so much myself.

"8 years ago I spent 200€ on expensive cosmetics, today I threw them away","I was never into cosmetics. Never wore make up, but 8 years ago on my way to the book store, one of those sellers in front of stores approached me and gave me a free 10 minute face massage with their products, while trying to sell me all kinds of products. I ended up buying 200€ worth of products, for face, bath salts, manicure sets, lotions. The lotion even gives you a gold shimmer, like glitter. I don‘t know what got into me, I‘m not even into glitter. 

Fast forward, 3 moves and 8 years and I even never used one. It was so nice and expensive I was like, I will use this for a special occasion. Today I looked at them and only felt contempt. For buying something so expensive, for something I didn‘t need, for something that‘s not for me. 

They were all still sealed and packed as they landed in the trash bin. The best feeling I got from these products was when I threw them away. Sucks for wasting 200€, but meh, I learned my lesson.

Decluttered over 70 bags/boxes this year!,"I spent the last few months decluttering my drawers, cabinets, and closets. I couldn’t believe how much clutter I had hidden. I am a 29(f) with husband and two kids. 

Most of my decluttering came when I was really stressed out at work and didn’t have much to do while waiting. I work from home, so I decided to tackle the junk counter and drawers that had been piling up for months. One draw, became two, and then the whole kitchen. Next thing I know, two weeks had gone by and I cleaned out my entire house.

It looked like was moving for two weeks. I had boxes and bags everywhere. I drive a sedan and took two car full to charity. I gave boxes of baby stuff away. For the rest, I called 1-800-got-junk to pick it up from the side of my house. 

My boss was curious what I got rid of that was so much and I could hardly remember. But here’s what I remember: college textbooks, books, clothing, kid’s toys, baby items, party decor, broken storage, organizers, empty shoe boxes, worn bedding, expired skincare/makeup, random and broken knick knacks. I seriously found over 50 pens and 20 scotch tape.

Advice for a sentimental anthropomorphiser.,"I know that this sounds weird. I blame Toy Story and The Brave Little Toaster. I’ve always had trouble discarding things into the trash. I am somewhat better at donating but I feel bad for things going into the landfill. I recently got new slippers after having a pair for about two years. I went to throw out the old ones because honestly no one wants slippers like that and it made me horribly sad. I was thinking them saying “wait we kept your feet warm for two years please don’t send us away!” Or a pair of sleep PJ pants I’ve had for years where the fabric ripped. I’ve mended them because they are so soft. I feel like they’ve served me so well and to dump them in the trash is horribly cruel. I think about how much we’ve been through in the time I’ve had them. 
I know that sounds totally CRAZY but it bothers me a lot to think of the unwanted things headed to the landfill. I’ve tried Marie Kondo’s thanking them but that almost makes it worse. I’ve also taken pictures but for me the tactile item can’t be replaced in that way.

Different relationship to stuff than previous generations,"Does anyone else find themselves completely unable to relate to previous generations' patterns of hanging on to things?

I've moved every two years since I left home, and I don't have the resources to store and move knickknacks, old birthday cards, spare mugs, and stuff I had when I was a baby. 

At my age, my grandparents had already bought the house they would live their entire lives in, whereas I'm used to living with a partner in a tiny one-bedroom apartment. It's not that I don't have emotional attachment to objects (I do) or that I can't see them having utility at some point in the future (I can).

"When you look through your closet for things to wear, how many things do you -not even consciously -nearly almost pass over daily?

It has come to my awareness how often I just automatically and (previously)unconsciously pass over multiple items in my closet every single time I look in it.

The ' burden ' of owning stuff,Last week I was with my friends and we went shopping. Which was the first time in for ever because COVID. The two for them bought clothing ( like one of them bought over 10+ items at different second hand stores) and I was like no thanks I'm not even looking at stuff for myself I'm not buying clothes because that only means that at some point I have to declutter it. Which they seem to think was depressing.  But I really see it like that. I own so much stuff I feel like I'm spending more time decluttering and tidying than actually enjoying my stuff. At this time I rather not buy clothing or just buy something that's absolutely perfect because it's easier not to buy stuff than decided what to keep and what to donate. Or  I just buy candles and beauty stuff at this point because then you use it up enjoy it and it's not there anymore which is easier..😅 because I really feel like it's a burden that I own a lot of stuff.. anyone else feels the same ?,declutter,1629740859.0

Habitat wouldn’t take my furniture donation,"We’re moving & I’m getting rid of stuff while packing. Initially, we were going to hire a mover that would also pack, but the cost is insane & our time table moved up to where we can’t get a mover now without paying even more. The mover we were going to use also encouraged me to NOT get rid of stuff. 

I took a load over for donation of my craft room furniture and they wouldn’t take it! I felt really bad cuz the stuff (imo) was “nice enough” & I felt/thought to myself “you won’t take my crap when I’ve seen what the s**t you sell here looks like?” I didn’t say that to them, but I thought it!

I had a total break-down ugly crying session when I got home. I realized I’ve been asking myself if I’m worthy of something instead of asking if it’s worthy of me when bringing it into the house.

So I took a load over to the dump & it felt really freeing & good. I’ve gotten 2 other loads donated this week. I listed the dining table for sale, I’ve got more stuff piled up for donation & I’ve got another load in mind for the dump. 

The next time you find yourself feeling “bad” about your stuff, ask yourself if the stuff is worthy of YOU instead of asking if you’re worthy of it (or even believing you’re not). This goes in line with my buying for the idea of who I want to be or thought I could be if I owned something as opposed to who I really am now. Asking that item’s worth in relation to me has helped flip the script on why I keep hold of things that are actually dragging me down & helping to lower my self-esteem cuz of the clutter or low-quality of the item.

I don't hate dusting anymore!!!,"For me this is a big win.

I've always HATED dusting. Hated it.

Recently I've had 3 separate friends tell me that they can see a huge difference in my house, but it didn't really hit me until now. Because now, I don't hate dusting!

I don't have to put away random stuff from every horizontal surface before I start. I got rid of a bunch of furniture, because I don't need the extra storage anymore. I only have a few beloved pieces (mostly large rocks and books) decorating the surfaces that I did keep.

So dusting my house is now mostly dusting doorframes, beautiful art, and dusting around a few stone specimens on furniture.

It was a win I needed, because I've felt really discouraged, because no matter how much I do, it feels like there is always more. I've been actively purging my home for about 3 years. I do what I can when I can around slowly DIY-renovating, so it's taken a long time.

But after 10 SUV loads of donations, 1 SUV load of electronics recycling, 3 pickup-truck-loads to the dump, uncounted dumpsters and friends picking up stuff, it's making a difference. 

There's finally light at the end of the tunnel.

Family is upset at me decluttering my own stuff,"I’ve been doing really good at decluttering (as a former addicted shopper), but my family has been really upset with me. 

For example we have probably 100+ old pens scattered in the house - I tried to declutter 5 of them today and my Dad went ballistic on me; saying they’re still good, why toss it out, I’m being irresponsible etc. For me I just see it as taking up space. We already have enough pens. 

In fact they try to convince me not to declutter my things, saying one day I’m going to need it all and I’m going to regret getting rid of it (I.e. an old scarf I never wear, when I have 5 newer ones already). **edit: yes, I donate my old clothing and other items if in good condition. Parents still hate me doing so. I purchased the clothes with my own money** 

How do you deal with a family that doesn’t want you to declutter your own stuff? They are like hoarders, never wanting to let things go even if they’re old and dirty.

**Edit: thanks everyone for the advice! to clarify, I already do donate most things that I can** such as clothing and home items in good condition.

Just decluttered my engineering college notes: letting go of my past self,"I have an engineering degree but got my first job in warehouse management after graduation. It’s been 7 years since I finished uni, I have moved company, got promotion etc, all in the warehouse management and planning. Realistically I’m happy with my job; the hours are good, the money and benefit is pretty good, work life balance is there, I get along with my boss and colleagues. 

However I was having a hard time letting go of my physics, chemistry, and advanced math lecture notes and exercise books. 

After weeks of self analysis, I’ve concluded it’s difficult for me because:
1. I feel like I am ‘wasting’ my degree by not working in engineering field, even though I had a blast at uni and without the degree I wouldn’t have got my first job (they picked me because of my degree since they needed someone with a decent computer skill and a fresh college graduate seemed pretty savvy)
2. I feel like I might need these notes if someday I get a more technical job. Realistically, I’d have to compete with all graduate engineers to get an engineering job and start at a lesser pay. Without getting a master degree, It’ll be difficult for me to get a senior engineering job to match my current salary and I’m not thinking of getting a master degree anytime soon, not in the next 2-3 years.
3. I was a good student. I went to a very academic and highly prestigious high school and university. I took pride in my good marks. Letting go of these notes seemed like losing an identity as ‘the smart one’ to me.

This morning, I threw them in the recycling bin. I flicked through them once more, to be honest I don’t really remember how to solve these equations anymore. I literally kissed each exercise book, thanked them, and threw them in the recycling bin while saying out loud ‘get recycled now, will you’.

It’s so freeing. I feel a bit sad but at the same time i feel light and happy.
I have the space for them, my house is not cluttered as I’ve embraced minimalism for a couple of years now.
However, those notes and notebooks, stacked neatly, didn’t bring me joy. To me, they were nagging me because I don’t use them anymore and I’ve forgotten how to do all these intricate and complicated calculations that I was once so proud to be able to solve. 

I am free of them now, free of expectations to be ‘smart’ in an engineering way.
I like my non-engineering job, it’s time to move on, and my graduation testamur/certificate that I display on my bookcase is enough reminder that I did it, that I had a great time at college.
The past doesn’t identify me now, I’ve let go of that identity; of being the smart college student, and am ready to embrace who I am now, a young warehouse manager who is darn good at her job.

Decluttering makes more of a mess than having it all in boxes,"I've now decided to get rid of 90% of what I own, because no matter how much I organize and declutter, it just makes a bigger mess. I've already gotten rid of 75% of what I owned over the past 10 years, but the rest is just too much for the small space I'm living in. 

I've ""created"" closets by putting up plastic utility shelves and covering them with curtains, but it looks awful and I still feel like I'm sleeping in a storeroom, which is something I wanted to avoid. I still have a ton of boxes that I haven't gone through, and can't use my LR or DR anymore because of them. For some reason, I was determined to get back into my bedroom, so I moved the boxes into the LR. Now I hate my bedroom because of the ugly ""closets."" 

I don't know what the solution is anymore. I thought I'd make a bookcase wall in the LR to hold all the books, magazines and knick-knacks, but every time I look at that stuff, I want to throw it all away! I've recently donated three boxes of books to a thrift store, but I have several more at the bottom of the stacks of boxes. 

Knick-knacks are hard for me, because I don't really like decorative objects. They were all pretty much given to me by family and friends, so they're sentimental. The ones I bought myself are mostly boxes and cases designed to hold things like cards, collectibles, jewelry, etc. I've gone through all of them, and gotten rid of most of their contents, but I can't let go of the actual boxes! 

My plan for next week is to go through the three large 20 gal. containers of winter clothes and pick out a week's worth of clothes, then donate the rest, plus get rid of all the ones that no longer fit. Why do we always believe we're going to lose weight and fit into them again? I'm giving away 23 sweaters that don't fit me anymore, and besides, I barely ever wear sweaters here in FL.

I'm working on it, but it seems the more I do, the messier it gets. It was much nicer when I had all the boxes neatly stacked in the BR and I was living in the LR. But its done now, so I have to 'RESCUE"" my LR/DR from the mess!",declutter,1624214304.0

A “low-clutter” Christmas idea for those with kids,"Obviously, this depends on your kids ages and interests. Ours are teens and tweens and for the last several years, for their stockings I go to the local ethnic grocery stores or ethnic grocery aisle (Japanese, Indian and polish this year. Last year was Chinese, Scottish and Australian) and i buy them international candies, snacks and drinks.

It’s so much fun! Sometimes it ends up kind of terrible (I’m looking at you vegemite), sometimes awesome (Japan has a strong snack game), but it’s always fun and novel and silly.

And, the best part is, it’s really just grocery shopping. A bit of a pain to hit the multiple stores, but they like that I find them stuff and they say “What’s this?” And I say “I dunno, it’s not in English, eat it and see what happens”

What an amazing feeling to have a tidy 'guest-ready' home. A few years ago I would have been deeply ashamed by my messy house and would need at least an hours warning to have guests over. 
In the living room there were some cushions out of place and my laptop was out but that was about it (guest bedrooms and laundry room were another story but that's what closed doors are for 😊)

So many….bowls,"Two weeks ago I started throwing out 10 things a day. I do major decluttering a few times a year, but 10 things a day is something I can do every day, and I like decluttering. 
The fact that you have to ‘search’ for 10 things makes you look in those hidden corners, the drawers you never look in. 

Last week I was looking in the kitchen and I saw bowls in many different places. So I thought I would count them. How many bowls do we need … there’s just the two of us. And we don’t have visitors a lot. On a regular basis just my mom or our daughters. 

Now bowls are something that we like to buy. Sometimes because we need to (the holiday accommodation had only very tiny bowls and we like to have breakfast in larger bowls so we bought two larger bowls in the thrift store. (This, three times. Same with mugs. 😬) Sometimes because we see a bowl we LOVE. 

Anyway. I started counting and I quit counting at 52…. 😱 and that was not all. 
I was in shock LOL. I am not a hoarder,  and everything is nicely put away in the cupboards … how was it even possible we had 52 bowls? 

So we donated some to the thrift store. 

Today I am looking for another 10 things to declutter, and looked in a box in the garage. Guess what I found there? 16 more bowls.

Grief and hoarding? Growing up?,"So when my mom died I didn’t know what to do with her stuff so I threw it in storage then I moved in with a roommate and we used more of their stuff than mine so I put the entire apartment in storage. I’ve pulled stuff out over the years but this year my storage unit was gonna go to $400 a month. So I purged as much as I could and realized how much farther in my grief I am than before. Before I couldn’t part with anything and now I can comfortably donate my moms things and keep a few for myself. 


I was able to get down from a 10x20 to a 10x10 and will continue purging but at least my payment went from 400 this month to 160. 

It’s progress. I know for sure I’m going to keep my kitchen stuff but the rest will be gone through. 

I’m glad I’m also able to help some cousins in their first homes. I was able to give one cousin a huge dining table and another a breakfast table and some big mirrors. Like at least it’s getting used. Plus my style has changed immensely over the years and I’m not that person anymore. 

And I was able to sell some stuff too which was really nice. 

Progress is progress. My goal is to get my clothing and such down to fit into my duffles/suitcases and everything else can pack and go easily.",declutter,1693355931.0
A terrible turn of events involving ancient cables,"I was gearing up to tackle decluttering my miscellaneous electronics crap bins. By fully tossing it. I never go to the bins! Full of cables and bits whose meaning and connected devices have long since escaped me. 

But I got my son a new computer and we were missing the right monitor cable. I went to the ancient tangle and found one that looked like it would fit. It was from a computer a decade since. And it fit. And I was happy for him. And I died a little.

Let go of a sentimental item today,"So my grandfather made a toy box 30-40 years ago, somehow when he passed I inherited it. I've been carrying this thing around for 15-18 years and not once used it. I tried to use it when my middle child was born, had it revamped by a local painter to match his room etc. It still sat empty. Today, I let it go. It was hard. I felt immense guilt but my children never knew my grandfather and I have other items that my daughter uses daily that he made for me when I was young including a doll house, doll cot, high chair and dolls wardrobe.

"Tackled the freezer, a job I've been putting off for more than a year","My freezer wasn't actually bad, I threw out less than 5 lbs of expired food, but it was mostly almost-empty bags of frozen veggies/fruit. That made it look like it was overflowing, but it was just how we shoved things back when we finished cooking. It's actually not-even half at capacity, which lets me know I'm not overbuying food and I'm eating what I am buying.

The worst part of it was chipping away ice that had formed in the tray and shop vacuuming ice chunks out of there. 

Since my freezer is just two giant drawers, I used some left over drawer organizers to split one huge drawer into three small sections and got it nice and organized. Need to invest in some little container boxes to finish splitting up the deeper bottom drawer of the freezer, which is  75% empty. 

Best part - I found a whole unopened sleeve of Thin Mints in the bottom of the freezer, so I know what I will be snacking on tonight as a reward. I also am using the remains of ten separate almost empty bags of frozen veggies for some stir fry for dinner. 

This is a success and a huge weight off of me today.",declutter,1639784586.0
Told myself I’d remove 100 items from my house in August,"... and I managed 9 😂 

It’s kinda depressing in some ways how little progress I made, but a couple of the items in particular were high value (like a graphics card) that I was sat on for a while and were kinda stressing me out. 

I’ve also made some progress with a number of other things, with something being collected tomorrow and others being in a box ready to be or donated, so it wasn’t a complete failure.

My Mom holds on to the weirdest things...,"My parents are currently decluttering their house and preparing to downsize. I thought I would share this funny story my Dad told me.

He was clearing out the laundry room and found 2 irons on the top shelf, neither of which my mom uses. So he asks her, ""Why do we have 2 extra irons?""

My Mom says, ""Oh I got one as a gift years ago and never needed it. The other one is broken but I want to keep it.""

""Why do you want to keep a broken iron?""

""That was the first iron my grandmother gave me when we got married."" I cannot believe it. I laughed so hard.

They got married in 1985. The iron stopped working sometime in the 90s. The best part? We moved halfway across the country in 1998. So as my Mom was packing, she picked up the BROKEN iron and thought, ""Yeah this will be good to drag across 1800km and put in the new house.""

My Dad reassured her and told her the house is filled with more sentimental memorabilia than a broken iron and it's time to let it go. Thankfully, she agreed.

Majorly decluttered my wardrobe and surprisingly getting compliments on the most random items.,"My motto for a few years was accumulate clothes and have a closet full of variety. People would give me clothes. I went to thrift stores. I'd get rid of clothes slowly as wanted/needed.

I challenged myself to wear every single item in my closet (within reason, fancy dresses excluded) before re-wearing. I spent a day putting together outfits. I had all these screenshots of outfits and I was like, how can I make that from my closet. I wasn't strict on it. After wearing it, I got rid of anything I thought I would never wear again, or realistically if I had only worn it like twice since owning it. I had clothes that I loved but the underwear needed was annoying so I'd never wear it - donated.  And the list goes on. I got rid of half my closet.

I got compliments on the most random clothes that were 8 years old. I'm so much happier with my closet. I know everything in there fits me properly now. And I know how to mix and match things wayyy better than I did. I can throw together an outfit much quicker. Before it took me forever. I actually wear more variety in my outfits now with less clothes than I did with more clothes.

tldr; purge your closet and you may be surprised how much easier it is to find things. And how much happier you'll be with your wardrobe.",declutter,1692373069.0

The more stuff you have the more you have to worry about,"Was just moving apartments the other day and it blew my mind just how much useless junk I had.

I realized it was all pointless. I don't need any of this junk and I never did. Will old articles of clothes and excessive furniture give me any benefit in the next life? All it does is make me worry and quite honestly clutter up my mind. Not to mention finding things becomes a nightmare.

I don't want to do this anymore. I'm donating all the clothes I don't need or use. All those old multivitamins that probably didn't do anything to begin with.

Inherited clutter revelation,"I just came to a realization. I have donated a couple dozen bags of stuff since January, but the sticking point has been inherited things.

Over the past years, family members have moved and downsized. And more stuff than I ever needed or wanted has been passed onto me. 

We all like antiques and vintage, and there have also been plenty of things passed from previous generations, who also appreciated those types of things. Most of it falls into that category. Not exactly true family heirlooms (and I will hold onto the truly meaningful heirlooms), but more like, ""your grandmother was into milkglass, teacups, and dolls -- here are those collections which I fondly remember growing up with!""

I've taken a lot of it, because I know it would be painful, for example, to tell my mom (painful to her) that I don't want something that is meaningful to her but that I don't have special memories of, don't really like, or don't have a use for. Sometimes I've been told, ""This is valuable, if you don't have a use for it, you can sell it!""

So I have a garage full of bins of stuff that ""I can sell"" or use in a theoretical house that I will own someday. But it's a lot of work to sell things, I'm done with having garage sales, and shipping breakable things makes me nervous. And I probably will never have a place, or desire, to display most of those things.

Of course, some of it I do love. And I'll keep those. 

But I just had a realization: 
The amount of money I could get for those things doesn't compare to my time, and the amount of stress that they cause me now. (And they are causing me a lot of stress, and have done for years.)

And whatever pleasure they bring (truthfully, not a lot) doesn't compare to to the pleasure of just owning things that I really love. And it doesn't compare to how great it will feel to have more usable closets -- or a garage I don't have to walk through sideways and can park a car in again. 

With that realization, I can donate these things now and feel okay about it. I don't have to feel guilty about not selling. People who appreciate them will find them (much like how my grandmother or mom collected them) and the proceeds will benefit local charities. And I get space -- physical and mental -- back. 

I can release these things. I feel lighter just thinking about it.",declutter,1645832609.0

Getting rid of professional clothes that KIND of fit,"Yeah, just a random brag. In the beginning of my career as a lawyer I bought a lot of random clothing on clearance that kinda sorta fit.

Not everything I posted online was wanted but the pile got smaller so when I was on about 3 boxes I took the trip to my local donation center. 

You can also get things for free but my mindset was to get rid of my things instead of bringing new things in the house. It's a good way to give things a new life that my otherwise have gone to a landfill or who knows where. And it stays super local.

"Before I buy stuff, I do this little mental exercise","Before I buy something, I ask, “Will I regret this later?” Will I be happy with this purchase in a day, a week, and a month?  How long will the euphoria last?  How much joy do I expect from using this item versus buying it? There’s nothing like pre-planning my buyer’s remorse.

And that’s just the warm-up exercise!

Next, I ask tougher questions:  Will I soon feel indifferent about this purchase?  Will I cram it in a cupboard, slam the door before things crash out, and forget about it?  Will it languish in my pantry, nestled between the dusty bread maker and food dehydrator?  Worse yet, will I banish it to the basement storage room where forgotten junk goes to die?

Will this thing I bought—this temporary treasure—be entombed under a mountain of abandoned items until decades later when my kids hire an excavation crew to clean out my house?  Will they even look at it before throwing it away?  Or will this thing, in its original packaging, be the final straw that causes my kids to say, ""We need to rent a second dumpster.""

Helping my parents move. It’s made me equally angry and motivated.,"I took the whole month of August off of work so that I could help my parents (78f/80m) move.  I went home for a couple of days because my kids were going back to school and I wanted to be there for them. I live 2 states away, about an 8 hour drive. 

My parents have lived in the same house for 51 years. Obviously they’re going to have some stuff, and a lot of unnecessary stuff, but helping them pack and clean has really opened my eyes to their well maintained hoard.  They always kept a neat house, has guests over frequently, and has money to hire a person to clea. But under the surface it’s a wreck. 

Their house is like a museum.  My mother is a really sentimental person, and it’s been making this process more difficult because she thinks of the house as another person in her life.  Three of my grandparents died before I was born, a one grandmother dies about 20 years ago. This is part of the problem, my mother can’t part with her parents old things. It’s generational, because a lot of the stuff is from great-grand parents, great-greats and so on. There is no way she will part with a single thing but that’s fine, it’s has great value to her. 

But where I really got frustrated is when I found her collection of used ziplock bags, a collection 30-year-old plastic butter tubs, rocks, sticks, rubber bands, recipes, lists and notebooks, gloves that are missing their pair,  scraps of fabric, and mostly burnt but not quite finished birthday candles.  The list could go on. Dad and I rented a 20’ truck just to transport her house plant collection but still had to make a second run because not all of the orchids would fit.  I just don’t get how the ziplock bags have as much value to her as the heirloom antiques. And I’m exhausted by the month long work (she even had several days that professional packers came to box everything we couldn’t get to).

I’m tempted to fully explore “The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning” because I don’t want my kids to have to go through what this month has been like.  I haven’t read it, it’s on my bucket list. 

The thing is, my mother and her sisters had to rent a dumpster and it took them nearly a year to get through my grandmothers secret hoard. They were so disgusted when they found several garbage bags full of old stocking (grandma was a teen during the Great Depression) and cans of food from the 1950’s (found in 2005).   Grandma hoarded food and scrap fabric. My mother was upset by her mothers behavior, but she does it too.  I’m just exhausted from this month long clean and packing, and I hope this doesn’t become my legacy too.  

I really appreciate all the posts about ways to discard and all the love and support from this community.",declutter,1693790433.0
I can't hire a cleaner because my house is too messy," 

I qualify for paid house cleaning as part of my job (up to 4 hours per week, paid for by my employer).

But I feel like I can't use it as my house as too messy! Let me give you some examples:

\- vacuuming - the floor is covered with toys and my daughter goes mad if I try to move them as they are all in a special set-up.

\- changing the bed sheets etc - the sheets are all in random places and would be hard for the cleaner to find. Plus my kids beds always have tons of toys covering them.

\- doing the laundry - it's cramped and hard to reach the washing machine

\- cleaning the kitchen - the bench is covered with things like appliances and papers, and I would like them to wash and put away the dishes, but how would they know where to put them?

\- cleaning the bathroom - it's so chaotic - sure, they could clean the bath and the sink, but the towels and things are crammed in everywhere. There are stacked up cardboard boxes of nappies, etc.

\- I could use the cleaner money to pay someone to cook for us, but my kitchen is so chaotic I would be ashamed to try to show them where the food is.

I don't even know what chores the cleaner should do. As you can see, I've never hired a cleaner before.

I feel like getting the house ready for the cleaner would be so much it effort, it would be dreadful. I definitely don't want to spend hundreds of hours decluttering right now. At the same time, I REALLY want to have the house cleaned.",declutter,1676244180.0
Are you tired of the constant clutter? Don't you just wanna snap?,"I've been a ""pack rat"" all my life. I'm always decluttering because I'm always buying more stuff. I'm always cleaning and organizing because there's so much to take care of. I watch Hoarders and see people desperately clinging to literal garbage screaming, ""This can still be useful someday!!"" and I see myself in them when I can't get rid of things I've had, unused, for a decade because ""it might be useful someday."" My place is always clean, but it comes at a great cost to my time, energy, and attention.

I put myself on a Low Buy for all of 2022 and I'm doing NoBuy for August. That helped since stuff coming in has slowed to a trickle and now stopped completely. I started decluttering (for the millionth time) in July when suddenly, I snapped. I've been in a frenzy the past week decluttering. It's like I'm obsessed.

I've decluttered 540 items the past week. I want to reach 1,000 by the end of August, but I want 5,000 items gone ***right now***!!! I can't take it anymore!!! I'm resisting chucking it all into the garbage because that'd be wasteful. It'll probably take me all year before I'm able to sort, clean, donate, sell, etc the amount of items I want until I'm satisfied. I'm *so*. *done*. I want to be free!",declutter,1659490052.0
How to start EASY home-wide cleaning/decluttering/minimalizing in 1-2-3! (Long but worth it),"Pre-Context: So, I'm about to invest a good hour or so this morning into quick-cleaning my house. I deep cleaned it on Saturday, but my sister and her family including a 2-year-old came to visit yesterday, and the 2-year-old played her little heart out dragging all sorts of things from our playroom. I loved every second of it because she had a blast and so did my kids with her. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* **THIS POST FEELS LONG BUT WORTH IT I PROMSE!**

Disclaimer - the below is not how everyone does their clean-up/declutter/minimalizing routines, but it's worked well for me over the last ten years. Also, this is not a thorough deep clean, it's a start to help you breathe. Once you've done all three, you can do a deeper dive with the same concept later on.

&#x200B;

# 1-2-3: 

&#x200B;

* ***What to use***: 3 containers. Personally, I like two laundry baskets (LB) and one mid-sized storage container with no holes (TB - trash box). LB#1 will hold things that don't belong in the first room. LB#2 will be for things I instantly know can be donated. TB is literally just for trash that I can pour into our dumpster on the side of the house. Pouring it in instead of bothering with trash bags has worked for me better, but do what serves \***you**\* best. 
* ***Phase 1 - Intro*** 
   * Pick your first room. Put your three containers in the middle. Start your first 1-2-3 time routines.
      * Time #1 - Set a timer for 5 mins and aim to find all the trash you can easily see around the room and throw it in your TB. If you run out of things to throw away, jump to time #2.
      * Time #2 - Set a new timer for 5 mins and pick up everything easily spotted that does not belong in that room and put it in LB#1. If you finish before the timer goes off, jump to time#3.
      * Time #3 - Set a new timer for 5 mins, pick up any items around the room that you can easily decide within 10 seconds if you're ok with donating them and put them in LB#2. Don't go crazy trying to toss everything in the LB#2, this is for easy choice items. You'll be surprised at how many things you discover you are ready to donate. 
      * **NOTE: YOU WILL POTENTIALLY MISS THINGS FROM THOSE CATEGORIES IN THE FIVE-MINUTE INCREMENTS AND THAT'S FINE.**
* ***Phase 2 - Relaxed Clean***
   * Now that you've cleaned off the surface of the chaos, you can fine-tune your cleaning direction. If that means straightening a pillow on the couch or making the bed in your room, do your thing.
      * **Set a timer for 15 minutes and go wild, but stay in that room. If you find additional things that fit in your three containers, continue to utilize them.** (Dump your TB items into the outside trash dumpster/container as you need to regardless of the room you're currently working on.) 
      * **If you feel like you've finished before the 15 minutes goes by, feel free to go to your next room and restart the timer.** 
      * **If you feel like you're far from basic done at the end of 5 minutes, set another 5 and challenge yourself as if it were a race. Don't kill yourself, but have fun with the challenge!**
* **REPEAT PHASES 1 & 2 ROTATING ROOM BY ROOM IN YOUR HOME. As you go room by room, try to put away clear items from your LB#1.  You can do another walkthrough put away during phase 3 if you miss putting a few items away in phase 2.** 
* ***Phase 3 - Final walkthrough***
   * Now that you've gone through all the rooms with Phase 1 & 2, start back at the first room. Take a look around and see if there's anything simple you still need to address. If you're satisfied, pop out that vacuum and clean the floor. I'm amazed every time how good it feels after the vacuuming is done. Repeat to each room as is necessary. If you feel especially adrenaline-driven - feel free to grab a rag and your disinfectant of choice and wipe down counters in appropriate rooms. At the end, look at your LB#2 with the donate items and determine if they're ok being thrown in a big trash bag to donate, or if they're sturdy enough to need a box. If so, grab one if you have excess stored away, or you can ask for sturdy boxes from the banana section in your local grocery store. 

&#x200B;

I realize that's a lot to read, but if you can follow those 1-2-3's for a basic home-wide cleaning/declutter/minimizing - it'll help tremendously with the feeling of too much surrounding you.

Things I Decluttered This Month,"•20 makeup items given to my sister and dad’s girlfriend 
•18 small home decor knickknacks 
•7 articles of clothing 
•10 books 
•1 stack of receipts I was keeping just in case
•5 pictures I was going to do a project with but know I never will 
•Two items of clothing returned to TJ Maxx 

One in, one out-
Needed a new mascara and hairbrush, so the old ones went into the trash. And a new bowl to put our keys in, silly I know, but it’s the little things in life lol.

These are all small things, really just a maintenance declutter. The volume they took up was only about 4 grocery bags, but that’s still over 60 things I never have to think about again! The small things add up!

Does it make me a bad person,"I just decluttered about 10 years of *things*. It has taken me 4 weeks to completely finish. Most of it was 10 years worth of paperwork that I needed to go through sheet by sheet. Most was schoolwork, notebooks, binders, books etc. 

I had originally planned to donate most of my items, but I've gotten to the point where I'm completely mentally exhausted and do not feel like putting in the effort to even donate the items (like binders and folders, crafts things like brushes, small nick nacks, some electronics like strobe lights, etc) 

I think I'd feel guilty of tossing things that could be donated because of the *waste* factor. But I feel just as guilty wasting this much *time* as well when I could be getting on with my life. 

I am 100% donating my collection of books. But everything else takes time to sort and shove in a trash bag and transport to the donation center. It's so much effort.

I am conflicted and would like your 2 cents (thoughts not money lol)

**TLDR; Does it make me a bad person to just dump it all in a dumpster and not waste another second on my *crap* ?**

Edit: The items in my ""donate"" pile really have no value. There's no clothing and no shoes. It's not large items. It's not furniture. It's not kitchen supplies. They're truly small/medium nick-nacks from my childhood like an entire box of buttons (the kind that come with new clothes), stack of used folders, faded construction paper, a bag of unopened feathers, etc.

Tried a new way to declutter clothes,"Step 1- remove everything from your closet

Step 2- store it elsewhere

Step 3- every day, go dress from your out of the closet pile. If you wear something, you can put it back in your closet (after laundry of course), given that you felt confortable wearing it. If not, discard.

Step 4- repeat as many days as needed. You can match a piece of clothing from the « keeping » closet to complete an outfit from the « elsewhere «  pile.

Step 5- assess what’s left after a few weeks 


What happened to me: 

I finally let go of bras that i wore only once because they were not as fitting as i thought when i bought them initially. I saw which pieces were ´orphans’ because they didn’t fit with anything else. I also saw that I had way too many dresses for the same unique occasion ( Christmas, funerals, etc) and discarded what was in excess.

This method also helped me discover new outfits/ clothe matching.

I began this thing in the end of winter/middle of spring , knowing that by the end of the process I would be left with clothes specifically for summertime. So this process is still ungoing. 

Also also, to speed up the process, I put back in the wardrobe the pieces I knew I had wore recently. 

If you have the space to have an «  elsewhere pile » I recommend it!!",declutter,1622808247.0
Making a budget unexpectedly made a big difference in maintaining a clutter-free home,"As many of us, I've struggled to maintain a clutter-free space after riding that initial decluttering high. New clutter appeared in my house seemingly out of thin air. Sometimes I did realize that I'm about to buy something I might not really need, but I'd convince myself that I will only try it out and declutter it if I don't like it, or it's fine just this once, or I really do need it after all etc. I'm an impulsive shopper and find it hard to resist the appeal of a shiny new thing, in case it isn't already clear.

&#x200B;

Recently, I've realized that it's time to put my finances in order, or I might end up being perpetually broke. I did the - maybe unnecessarily laborious - work of calculating each of my habitual as well as impulsive purchases, sorted by category, and was shocked by how much I spent on certain categories of items. It made me revaluate what I buy and subsequently bring into my home. I'd look at each category and ask myself questions like ""Am I really okay with spending $100 monthly on vitamins, or can I cut some from my regimen? Do I actually need these hair vitamins when I likely already get all the nutrients I need from food?"" or ""Why do I keep buying spices I will likely only use once or twice for this particular recipe?"". 

&#x200B;

Nowadays, I make a list of all the things I need or want to purchase when I plan my budget for the month. Knowing I can only spend so much makes me carefully consider whether I really want this thing or if it was only a momentary impulse to buy, weigh pros and cons etc. If it's something I buy online, I try to do it all in one day, and unless I write it down or put the item in my cart, I don't even remember I wanted it in the first place 95% of the time. If it's shopping in-store, I make a list in advance and beeline for the items on my list instead of browsing. If I'm shopping for something particular, like a coat, I have to make sure it matches all the needs and wants I have for a coat, because I won't set another coat budget for a while in case this one doesn't fit or perform like I want it to. I still slip up occasionally, but overall it has drastically reduced the new clutter.",declutter,1682104683.0

I now have a “fit by date” for clothing,"I’m sure we’ve all experienced how hard it is to get rid of clothes we love that don’t fit us (yet!).

I had the idea to pin a piece of paper to the clothing with a “fit by date” on, similar to how food has a use by date. I was generous with the timings. It just has to fit by the end of the year or I get rid of it.

Discovered and excellent resource to help with decluttering and tidying up,"I have always been a messy person. I'm good at tidying if everything has a place, but the minute there are too many things and not enough places it's like my brain short-circuits and I can't *do* anything. Plus I find it much easier to hang on to things ""just in case"" than I do to throw them out, so it's really easy for me to wind up with more things than places.

Since I was little my spaces have been cluttered, and it hasn't really bothered me. Then I had a kid, which on one hand increased  the amount of stuff on hand exponentially, and on the other hand made it much less practical to be as cluttered as I am. Plus, my general level of clutter HAS started to bother me, as I'd like to be able to invite friends and family over without having to spend two days doing a massive cleaning of common areas.

I started reading ""How to keep house when you're drowning"" **by KC Davies** last weekend and it is amazing. It has some really practical cleaning strategies, but beyond that it also has a lot of positive encouragement about cleaning and caring for your space while trying to dispel some of the shame and judgement that is often felt by people who aren't tidy.

Whoever recommended these books - thank you!!!,"Wow!  Thank you so much!!  

Yesterday, I finally had the incredible motivation to go through all my makeup, hair supplies, and other junk in my bathroom. 

I have a lot of Audible credits, so I got: 
How to Keep House While Drowning, by KC Davis, LPC and The Hoarder in You, by Dr. Robin Zaslo. 

Since I was going through makeup I haven't worn in years, I started listening to the 2nd book about hoarding. I don't consider myself a hoarder, but I definitely have some tendencies. After listening to that while going through years of makeup - yikes!! I could only listen to a few chapters. It was like a knife in my heart, but in a good way. 

Then I put on How to Keep House, and it was a balm to my soul. Just what I needed. Really,  both of these books are going to be helpful. They're totally different, but I believe they'll really spur me on to do what I need to do as we pack our house to move. 

For the first time, I feel hopeful. 

I'm also having some grace for myself. Instead of berating myself. Between a lifetime of severe trauma and being neurodivergent - I'm actually realizing that I'm doing the best I can. I'm learning to accept myself.  I'm realizing I can be nicer to myself because I seriously am doing my best.

I like minimalism as a concept but absolutely hate the aesthetic of it.,"I’m all for minimalism in terms of what it’s about. Getting rid of stuff you don’t need or use, (and want, to some extent), only keeping and using the things you need or want. 

That being said, I hate the blank empty spaces. It makes me so uncomfortable, especially when the furniture is white, like mine. Maybe this means I’m not a complete or full blown minimalist but it just looks to…sterile? Devoid of personality? Obviously one way to fix this would be to get different colored furniture but I’m not gonna do that. It’d be completely pointless as it’s nice furniture. I finally did get rid of some stuff yesterday (two boxes and a bag of clothes) and that was a really nice feeling and I cleared off the tops of my dressers and bookshelf and while they look nice and cleaner, I just really don’t like the white space.

Mine include:

* Making sure the spot where I unload groceries is bare before going shopping.
* Setting out the fixings of my preferred drink before I go out for errands (especially if it's a big-box store or a walk in the snow), so I have a reward (and less temptation to stop for cocoa on the way home).
* If an item going into its ready-to-be-used spot (not pantry storage) doesn't need to be sealed for perishability, opening it when I put it there. This includes opening jar lids as the jars go into the refrigerator and  unsealing the new plastic wrap box as it goes into the drawer.

New Decluttering Goal/Epiphany,"I started this decluttering journey in December of 2020. Had a few periods of backsliding, but it was more of an irritation at having to catch back up than any real damage done. Most of the time I'm maintaining and chipping away at little areas that need to be done.

But yesterday I had the thought of why not view my little house like an AirBnB? I stayed in a few when relocating, and loved how they were prettily decorated, clean, and fully stocked when I moved in.

One was especially great. The woman who owned it would come with a maid every other week, clean, tidy up, change the bedding (including ironing the sheets!), make the bed look beautiful and inviting, and leave an arrangement of fresh flowers for me to enjoy. It was so lovely to come back to.

So what if I act simultaneously as AirBnB owner, always looking with an eye to everything being as peaceful, beautiful, uncluttered, clean as I can make it for my guest, with me being the guest? Like I'm living my life on a relaxing holiday, but this AirBnB also just happens to have everything I own that I most love and need, without having to pack or unpack!

The down side is I also have to act as my own maid, but I do that anyway, and when I'm thinking in terms of ""How can I make this really nice for The Guest?"" cleaning doesn't seem so much like a drudgery, I'm taking my time and enjoying doing it for The Guest, lol.

Parts are already good to go, but other parts I'd change if I were renting this out, so I will change them. It'll be a process, but so far I'm having fun doing it!

I draw the line at ironing sheets. Spritzing with linen spray and smoothing them with my hands is as far as I'm willing to go, and it does make them lovely to slip into.

So my new decluttering goal is to make my place AirBnB ready. On a permanent basis (within reason).",declutter,1646694056.0
Reevaluating my relationship with material goods and consumerism,"I’ve been on my decluttering journey for a month now and I’m trying to sell my stuff online. It makes me feel good that my stuff are getting a new life even if it only sells for $5 (and honestly, the $5 adds up)

But selling is time and effort intensive. I look at similar items being sold online (for price checks) and I realize there are SO MANY people all trying to sell their stuff. And yet, as a society we always feel like we need to buy more stuff from retail stores. 

It was kind of an eye opener for me. We are conditioned to always want more more more, way beyond what is essential for a quality life. Our society is overflowing with stuff.

Here is what I learned: 
Rule one, don’t buy stuff unless if you’re sure you’re going to like it and use it for the long haul. No more mindless shopping, everything I buy must have a clear purpose. 

Rule two, try to shop on second hand market first before buying new things from retail stores. There are just so many items out there.",declutter,1644932382.0

The great thing about a rage purge is that the overwhelming vibe of frustration and anger overrides guilt or rational thoughts of, “Well, I’m sure it could be useful for SOMETHING.” The downside (or is it upside?) is it takes a lot of frustration before I boil over. In this case it’s the lack of initiation in my family. Everyone’s cheerful about helping when asked to tidy up… but I don’t WANT to have to ask. I don’t want to have to be the one reminding everyone to put away laundry, bring back game pieces to the board game shelf, or take out the recycling. Why is it my job to set aside holey socks, refill our stock of batteries, and check that we don’t run out of pencils and school supplies? What about deciding whether we need to keep the rain cover for our stroller (executive decision after months of doubt: we don’t). 

Not going to get into gender bashing here; I’m sure there are stressed-out men who are dealing with the clutter at home from their messy, hands-off wives and kids too. And I’m very open with my husband about being very conscious of how if I micro-manage things, everyone just expects me to continue micro-managing. We’ve had many, many talks, both friendly and rational and angry and crying (on my part) about how clutter ratchets up my anxiety and stress and makes me feel like I can’t handle life. I’m not throwing blame blindly. BUT. If the general consensus is that it’s my job to be responsible for stuff while the kids are still young… then fine. I will just make sure there is less stuff to handle. A heck of a lot less. Hence the rage cleaning.

Part 3. Living room/kitchen

How did they manage to break Duplo? It’s basically indestructible! Out with that piece. And a cute purple box with a chip in it. Repeating to myself: ‘I do not need to make everyone happy. I need to get this space decluttered before school starts.’ Listening to decluttering podcasts and vlogs: too many nice people and not enough angry people saying, “It is ok to be angry with feeling out of control in your house. Getting rid of junk, and making those unmade decisions, will help everyone.” 

Why do we still have as many mugs as we did when we had big groups of friends over? Let’s donate 5. Why do I keep all these too-hard games in our daily use cupboard? Let’s put those up high for next year. Why do we still have all these big reusable shopping bags since we’ve switched to the little ones? Let’s donate those. Extra silicone baby bibs - donate. Wall art - donate (since I thrifted it four years ago for about 7 euros, I’m pretty sure we’ve gotten our moneys worth out already.) Extra headphone cables - donate.

What I notice is that so many items were annoyingly in the way — only for me. The kids just push things out of the way to find what they need. So does my husband, or he’s not normally using that cupboard or drawer anyway so it doesn't occur to him to try to organize it. Or he thinks it’s my domain. Or something. 

I rationalize a lot, trying to be kind and not bitter, which is why it sometimes just builds up until I want to burn the whole house down and start fresh somewhere else. [Edit: I don’t actually want our house to burn down. We know people who had that, and it’s horrible and traumatic and expensive. I just want a fresh start and can’t see any way out of this struggle.] “But then you’ll just have the same problems, somewhere else!” is a normal argument to that idea. Um, no we wouldn’t. Because then my husband and kids and I would not be dealing with a backlog of years of stuff. I.e., my husband’s untouched old textbooks would be burned up, without me even having to say anything. My box of crafts that sits unused while I spend my ‘free time’ cleaning or helping others would also be burned up. But then I’d actually have time to buy another pack of markers or knitting supplies and do it, because I wouldn’t be wasting hours deciding, “Have the kids grown out of this train set? Is it wasteful to trash all the pink and white hair ties so we just have a basic set of black? Will husband get annoyed for how I’m filling up the front hall with undecided items and trash bags of donations?”

We’ve decided that we’re not going to move for another five years, so there is zero external motivation to dejunk, and lots of external motivation to leave things the way they are. How nice would it be to just put on blinders instead of being a cranky mom and wife because of all the choice overwhelm and anxiety. And I know all the good advice about motivating/including family to help towards a common goal. I know that in a few years, we won’t have to baby-and-toddler-proof everything (and I’ll hopefully be sleeping through the night). Bigger kids will be able to take more responsibility for their life. Maybe I’ll get better at being assertive instead of guilty. Maybe we’ll have more digitized, and less physical stuff lying around. I’ll have more brain space to handle my own workload, teaching, parenting, and still have time to recharge on my own. Different life seasons. 

Maybe I just need to schedule monthly rage cleans so I actually get stuff done fast, and then don’t have to feel constantly anxious about the clutter.

Has anyone reading here ACTUALLY successfully donated old towels and/or sheets to animal shelters?,"This seems to be something floating around and comes up whenever people want to get rid of these items. Before I approach a local animal shelter, I would like to get a sense of whether this an internet myth that's easy to trot out in a post, or have people really done it?

So I'd appreciate actual experiences with this and not speculation. If I get some affirmative answers I'll ask the local shelter if they want my old towels/sheets. If not, they go to textile recycling. Thank you!

Update - thank you ALL for your very helpful responses! I will contact the shelter and check. And will let you know (might take a day or two).",declutter,1689188697.0
getting rid of an ex’s things i didn’t know i had.,"this has to have a warning with it: my ex died in 2019 and was abusive so this post involves themes that go along with that kind of experience. this post is also long.

i’ve (27NB) been on a decluttering journey for almost a year now and i’ve held onto my ex’s stuff without truly realizing it since we broke up in 2018. our relationship lasted for 5 years, was tumultuous at best, and i got out of it for my own safety, which ended with her being kicked out of my apartment. she was so resistant that i had to take it upon myself to pack her stuff for her because she refused to do it. it was almost an impossible task in itself because she was a compulsive spender and had a LOT of stuff.

anyway, without going too much into the nitty gritty, her moving out was awful and it ended up with some of her things being left behind (though i didn’t realize it at the time). some of these things included art supplies that i decided to keep. the only things she ever asked for back that i forgot to send with her were two totes of decorations, which i then gave to her. the rest she said she didn’t care about.

and then she died a year later, and it was one of the most emotionally difficult weekends of my life. i’ve done a lot of work on myself since then, and i thought that i was doing pretty well.

so coming back to the present, i’ve had these art supplies along with some other things for years now. i’m an artsy person, so i figured i could use some extra paints and things. well, as you could probably guess, i never used them because i’m more of an acrylics and watercolors person while she used fabric paint, oils, etc. i finally decided to get rid of them.

it felt good to let go of what felt like a piece of her that i had unintentionally been keeping in my house for years. and then i looked around and realized that there are other things of hers that i didn’t know consciously that i had. decorative items, dvds, kitchen gadgets… so many things. suddenly i was surrounded by reminders of the worst 5 years of my life. i couldn’t believe that i had looked over so many of them for so long. healing is funny that way.

so i’ve been ruthlessly looking through my things and getting rid of stuff that came from her. i don’t care what it is, it’s getting donated or trashed. most of it i would have gotten rid of anyway, like dvds i don’t watch and products i just don’t use but thought i would. it’s been hard, and emotional, and enlightening and freeing. so many things are being released from my life, my home, and my conscience. i did it, i’m doing it, and soon i’ll be done with it.

if you read this whole thing then thank you, i appreciate this community a lot and i’m happy to have somewhere to talk about these kinds of successes no matter how hard they are. :)",declutter,1675459267.0
Toiletries Use It Up Challenge,"When my Christmas 2021 toiletry gifts (4 shower gels and a lotion) just did not fit in my bathroom cupboard, I was confused. I don’t wear loads of makeup, I’m not into palettes and all that. So why is my cupboard so full of stuff?! It was just full with products, almost all unopened. I had 8 shower gels (all gifts) from previous years! So my new year’s 2022 resolution was to do a Use It Up Challenge with a 1 in, 2 out goal.

The Rules

1. This challenge applies to all toiletry items brought into the bathroom, including makeup. 
2. But not dental products, they are too important. 
3. And not counting bar products (because they have no packaging to put in the bin!)
4. Items can be used up, donated or tossed.
5. All items (in and out) need to be written down, to maintain accountability. 

I brought in 22 items this year (including the 5 Christmas items from 2021), and got rid of 60 items! There is now enough space in my cabinet to store 3 toilet rolls. 

But other than the space, it has really changed my perspective on products. I used to buy items in the 3 for 2 sales, to stock up for future. But actually, it takes my about a year to use up 1 face moisturiser, or 1 serum. I really don’t need to stock up! I did slip up and buy 3 products in the summer, but soon realised I already have back ups of those. I felt annoyed at myself for wasting money, but also then for needing to get rid of 6 more items! 
Secondly, I realised which products I like (I’m a surprisingly big fan of serums), and which I don’t (gel-based cleansers). 
And it’s also encouraged me to make time for myself to use up some products. When people gift you toiletries, usually they are trying to gift you a pamper/relaxing experience. So take them up on it and fit in 5 minutes to use the product! 

Anyway, I actually found this a very manageable and non-wasteful way of decluttering bathroom products. It was surprisingly fun choosing which product to focus on next, and competing with myself not to buy new things, or trying to incorporate an extra product into my routine. So if this is you, give it a go in 2023! My goal will be 2 in, 3 out this year to maintain momentum - but I still have 3 shower gels left!",declutter,1671796613.0
Brother's girlfriend keeps trying to dump their clutter on us and I don't know what to do,"This started roughly a year ago. Once a while she would come over and bring 1-2 big boxes or bags filled with her old clothing for me to look through. This has happened probably three or four times. How and why she has so much clothing is beyond me.
Anyways, few months ago she started trying to give us their unwanted decoration here and then. My brother and she are moving soon and now it's all gotten worse. Few weeks ago she wanted me to look at some random books that she bought _for decoration_. Then she asked if I wanted some of her old bed sheets. A few days ago she brought even more of their old stuff that they don't want to keep. Just now I received a message and by the notification I can see that she wants to know if I want some deco light.

I am so tired of this. I have tried to decline politely, for example one time she asked if I wanted a coat and sent a picture. Her style is pretty cheugy and I don't like it, so I replied with ""I already have a jacket for winter so I don't need it, but thanks"". She still brought it the next time she came over! She said it wasn't a winter jacket yada yada. To the bedsheet offer I just said that I had already bought new sets recently (which is true).

I am not a confrontational person and I have trouble saying no. I'm tired of basically being her clutter dump.

Edit: I just woke up and I didn't expect this post to blow up so much... I just needed a place to vent/rant about this. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read my post and maybe even decided to leave a comment. I appreciate it!! I'll try to read them all and reply. I texted my brother's girlfriend now ""No, but thanks for the offer"". I hope her dumping will stop. Otherwise I'll tell her that I can't take the stuff in because I'm decluttering and trying to live more minimalistically.",declutter,1661872512.0
By brutally culling the Tupperware…,"…we opened up a whole kitchen cabinet. By moving our cake/loaf pans and other baking miscellany into that cabinet, we then cleared a whole shelf in the bottom cabinet of the china hutch. By moving some tableware for special occasions (butter dish, gravy boat, condiment bowls) onto that shelf, we could move some pretty barware into the windowed upper part of the hutch. This in turn allowed us to consolidate all of our day-to-day drinking glasses and mugs onto one shelf, which meant the cereal bowls could have their own spot, which subsequently makes it much easier to grab our large dinner plates (because the cereal bowls aren’t stacked on top of them). 

Of course, along the way there were some other items we realized we didn’t need (chipped cereal bowls, stupid coffee mugs, that one mini bundt pan that never releases cleanly). But even just getting rid of ONE moderately overgrown category resulted in a cascade of positive organizational changes. 

Moral of the story: Little wins really snowball! And also orphaned Tupperware lids mysteriously replicate over the years.",declutter,1661494250.0
Another Huge Win!,"
 I have posted before about how my husband says he will clean up outside areas but doesn’t. A couple weeks ago I posted about how  I cleared off our driveway and how good it looked. No comments from him but no complaints about all the stuff I got rid of. Yesterday trash haulers came and cleared off our patio. (Husband out of town for the day LOL). Removed all the piles of broken junk and cleaned out a small extra storage room. Not only the “stuff” but all the garbage that had accumulated under it from pack rats. It was WAY worse than I had even imagined. 2 very polite young men who did an outstanding job. I gave them more than the agreed upon price. They actually came back and said you gave us too much money! Spent the rest of the day throwing away a couple things I regretted not telling them to take, scrubbed all the patio furniture and light fixtures, fixed and rehung a broken string of lights. I worked nonstop for 10 hours. Sat on my beautiful clean patio and enjoyed the stars. This old gal slept like a baby last night!",declutter,1681483733.0
Clothes that fit but are old/aren’t me anymore,"Update: 
So I listed 4 dresses to the free site in my area and found some nice things I forgot I have!!! Separating stuff now that I’ll just donate and not sort. The satisfaction from finding the couple nice lost gems has motivated me to go through more clothes! Thanks for everyone’s great advice. 

OP: 
So I’m now 24 but still fit the clothes I’ve had since middle school. This makes it so so so hard to de clutter any clothes because I still “fit” everything. I still have my old party dresses from bar mitzvahs I only wore once,but I don’t want to get rid of them because they still fit and are in like new condition. But I don’t want to be wearing a dress cut for a teenager on my adult body. But in my mind even tho I know I’m not going to wear these childish dresses, they still fit and are like new. I’m telling myself to give them away on the local free fb page but it’s hard. I have countless other clothing items like that too. Old travel t shirts and stuff that fits but look childish/old. Oh and how could I forget old tacky looking purses (my taste in accessories has changed since 14). Give me the motivation to get rid of them please . My room is really so cluttered I feel crippling overwhelmed.",declutter,1610106336.0
Declutter your sock bin and turn your old and mismatched socks into dog toys!,"I love this sub and constantly get lots of great tips and inspiration from people’s posts on here, so I wanted to pay it forward with a stroke of inspiration I had this morning while decluttering my sock bin. 


It was super easy and all you need is old socks and a pair of scissors (and, I suppose, a dog 😉). I braided together trios of crew length or thigh high socks, and cut up a few ankle socks into strips to tie both ends together. I had two leftover long socks, so I just tied several knots throughout the length of them. My dog loves them, I didn’t spend a dime, and now he has half a dozen new toys! 

I live by myself, but I was thinking this might make a fun activity for parents to do with their kids! I used socks, but I think it could work just as well with old rags or towels, or even clothing like T-shirts. Plus, I feel happy knowing that I’m extending the life of the sock fabric a while longer before it ends up in the trash, while cutting down on some of my clothing clutter. :) 

Hopefully this link works, here are some pictures of the toys I made and the playtime that resulted immediately following. I’m not a crafty person by any means so I’m sure someone with more skill could make them look much prettier, but Calvin still gives them 10/10 approval. 

Happy decluttering!

Feeling More Free,"Today I donated things of the past that weighed me down physically, mentally, and spatially. I took pics of my beloved Grandmother’s obituary and discarded the newspaper clippings as well as my first born’s bronzed baby shoes (which she never wore). I only purchased them with the intention of bronzing. I took pics of my certificates and plaques of my achievements from decades ago. I donated a ton of home decor and other miscellaneous items that hasn’t been used in a few year’s time. I discarded old manuals and kids’ artwork and even ornaments that I had no emotional connection to. I did this to reclaim the space for my family and I.

Family overwhelms me with stuff that I don't know what to do with,"So several of my family members continually overwhelm me with stuff.

I feel overwhelmed and usually have a small panic attack as I try to figure out where we will store everything. Last visit she brought me all of her childhood dolls from the 60s.

How to grieve getting rid of things that represent a lost dream?,"My husband and I are downsizing.

Who is your ‘Fantasy Self’?,"I thought it would be fun to detail our fantasy selves for all to see - and maybe how far away we are from those...

For those that don’t know, there is lots on YouTube but the fantasy self is the concept of who you ‘want’ to be - which is typically achieved by buying or accumulating stuff - but you rarely use - and if you’re honest, this isn’t you - an example could be you buy loads of bath bombs, essential oils, soaps, candles because you’re the type of person who has long luxurious baths and relaxes for hours on end - when in reality you’re a stressed mom of three who hasn’t taken a bath longer than 15 mins in the last three years.

My fantasy self is a rugged dad - he’s a real go getter - he’s active and he goes the park - he takes his two kids on adventures - he also journals and eats well, goes gym, is in shape. He wears kinda south western Ralph Lauren plaid, denim boots, but more out there stuff like waistcoats and bandanas (like a rugged Johnny Depp).

He enjoys “cinema” he buys DVDs and blu rays of films he really wants to watch and appreciate. He spends his free time reading books and watching films. He has a large collection of great movies and music.

He’s organised. He carries tools in his car, which is always clean inside and out. Always ready to help out - he even has winter tyres. Can you believe it.

decluttered and now I feel bad,"Cleaned out late mom's linen closet, she was a packrat, as in the house was presentable but every closet and drawer is stuffed.

I should have sold my American Doll in 1999,"I have a Felicity doll with a few official outfits, including some made my great aunt, in a box in my basement. She's in extraordinary condition because I always took care of her. Like many girls of the 80s and 90s, I poured over the American Doll catalogue every month, wondering at many girls beautiful dresses and things, and reading about their lives in that impossible land of the past. 

Felicity, though, was the doll I wanted, with her little flowered dress she had sewn herself and her red hair with three neat little curls on each side of her face. I saved up for months for her - which at $82 was a King's ransom to me. My mom made a deal that she would pay for half, but the other half I had to save up for. And I sold homemade stationary door-to-door at 50 cents a packet for it. (Although generous family members gave me as much a $5). Finally, I had enough, and she came. She was given a place of honor on my bedroom dresser. I'd play with her, of course, but I also would simply display her and change her outfit to fit the season or my mood. Sometimes I'd take her to friends' houses and we'd play with our American Dolls together. 

Of course, I eventually grew out of dolls, and Felicity was put in a box. And I still have that box, intending to gift her to a daughter or a niece. Well, so far, I don't have any daughters or nieces. I'm still keeping her - maybe  there still will be a little girl I can give her to, or even a little boy - kids are more free from gender restrictions these days. I'm lightly considering displaying her again - but  But I also know that while they might enjoy her, I cannot recreate the magic of that catalogue or saving up for her.

So, I'm realizing now I should have sold her back in 1999, when there were still lots of little girls who wildly wanted such a doll, but maybe couldn't afford a new one. Perhaps that means she'd be in someone else's box right now, or maybe she'd even be in the dump, having gone through many small hands. But she would have been used.

But then again, now that I still have her, I think I might keep her and maybe display her - creepy old lady vibes or not. ",declutter,1698249941.0
Closet Declutter 2022 is complete! Learned a couple of things in the process.,"I have way too many pieces of clothing, and my husband wanted for me to declutter a bit, particularly because there's many pieces that I own, but he hasn't seen me wear in our 4+ years of living together. However, I'm one of those people who have a lot of emotional attachment to things and clothes, so it's hard for me to get rid of stuff.

We made a deal: I was gonna wear every piece of clothing during 2022 on my closet, and what didn't get worn, he could donate/get rid of. The only exception was party dresses as those don't get worn that often and I don't have that many. We kept a bag in the room that got donated every time it got full. When I worn an item, it would go to the back of the closet so that it was easy to see what I had worn and what I hadn't. 

Things I learned:

* You gotta let go, you won't fit into your high school jeans anymore: I'm in my 30s, I've been about the same weight thought my adult life but my body has changed. I have hips now, my ribcage has changed. Even if I can put the clothes on, that doesn't mean that the fit is right.

* Keep stuff you actually like to wear: It may fit, it may fit well, but that doesn't mean that you like it. I had a lot of stuff that was gifted or bought by my parents growing up. That's just not my style anymore, or it never was but I kept it out of... guilt? No point on keeping stuff that you don't actually like.

* The only way to truly realize if something fits, is to wear for a couple of hours, not just a short fit. There were things, specially pants, that I tried on and was like oh this is ok! And then I had a meal or moved around and realized that I can't really wear this for more than an hour or two, so why keep it?

* It will be sentimental to get rid of certain things, clothes with memories, clothes that you like but don't really fit in anymore. Taking pictures before donating them helped, as to keep the memory.

* You get to rediscover your closet: There's things I had forgotten about just because I often stuck with the same 5-10 outfits. Forcing myself to actually go through all my stuff made it so I had to be creative and had some fun through the process by putting together outfits that otherwise I would not have worn.

I wish I'd done a count at the beginning of the year to see how many things I cleared out, but it was definitely sizeable. I liked the system of actually going through the stuff, so things got decluttered with an actual reason, and not just at random.

The plan for 2023 is to do the same with the stuff in the dresser, shoes, accessories (belts, purses, hats), makeup and, jewelry. Only what gets used will be kept!

I would love to hear what kind of clothes declutter y'all did in 2022, and what you learned from the experience.",declutter,1671839381.0

My room now looks really good and I'm deciding what to put in the space instead of making a pile in the corner. 
I even made two scary phone calls! Please someone say yay me.

I'm breathing proof there is always hope in doing even 5 minutes at a time. That's how I've tackled the photos so far and it's way less stressful and pressurised",declutter,1683885826.0
Don't toss all those ripped and stained clothes!,"I had a box of ripped and stained clothes I was going to throw out, but something told me to list it for free on a Buy Nothing group. I gave it to a girl who refurbishes old Barbie dolls and makes clothes for them to give to kids in homeless and abused women's shelters. Her husband refurbishes boy toys for the same thing. She says she uses such small parts of the clothes, that it doesn't matter if they're torn or stained. 

This makes my heart so full to know that what I considered trash is going to help children who are traumatized by life.",declutter,1630552856.0
"Sorted out my ""special box""","My mom kept what she called a ""special box"" for each me and my sibling - a rubbermaid tote filled with things she deemed ""special"" from when we were little - and she sent mine along with me when I moved to my own place. I finally reopened it this past weekend to sort through it, and I have to wonder what she was thinking! I kept only the obvious personal/sentimental items, and ditched things like candles from my first three birthdays, a baby name booklet, and worn-out baby dinner plates. Then since I had space in the box, I added two childhood dolls I decided to keep from another tote (donating the rest of the dolls box) and stashed it in a closet out of my way. 

Moral of the story - just because it's cute and sentimental to you, doesn't mean your kid will want to drag it around for life. And just because your parents kept it, doesn't mean you have to keep it when they pawn it off on you in adulthood.",declutter,1616530782.0
your complete guide to go from overwhelmed to semi minimalism,"I recently posted this on the minimalism Reddit but got a comment saying it would be better suited here! I hope this helps someone 

Your complete guide to go from overwhelmed to semi minimalism

yes I used to be a maximalist. I got my first apartment, along with a well enough paying job & went crazy with the decor. 

I got in this mindset that I needed this or that in order to have a cool apartment and the more cool decorations the better. 

and honestly everything went well together, and it looked decent, but then I never stopped. 

It was never hoarding level but I just had a lot of stuff,

I could never keep my apartment clean. It was really sad because I have a nice apartment, and i wanted to have people over but I never could because my apartment wasn’t clean.

Nothing had a home and I was just constantly trying to reorganize to make everything fit, 

To clean a bathroom counter it took me like half a hour because of picking up all the products and moving them

I felt so overwhelmed and I didn’t like how my apartment looked

I started having to designate every weekend to cleaning, which I then would just reorganize, make a bigger mess & have to repeat the next week

I also kind of had a shopping addiction, like it was fun, and something to do not to the point where i was in any kind of financial stress, just accumulated a bunch of stuff

Finally I broke, I had enough of working all week and cleaning all weekend, I kept researching how people kept up cleaning and I couldn’t find anything, 

Finally I decided to work towards minimalism, not insane minimalism but decluttering minimalism 

Here are some things that changed my life:

I went through every single thing, every single drawer, every single cabinet

I got some moving boxes from walmart which helped and I had a goal to fill up 5 large moving boxes with just stuff

I posted anything worth over $20 value on Facebook market place, kept the boxes for two weeks and then gave the rest to goodwill

Here are things I went through

bathroom area: 

I took all the products out and put them on my vanity 

anything I didn’t want, don’t like, it doesn’t work for your skin, the scents old, the packaging looks gross, there’s only a 1% chance the situation you’d use it in would actually happen, it’s easy and cheap to repurchase etc was given away

I checked duplicated and got rid of duplicates I didn’t see myself getting through in the next 2 years 

Then the kicker - I picked 3 drawers, hair supplies, makeup, and other and whatever I could fit I kept, 

(That was only about 30% of my vanity space used :)

same with shower stuff, anything I can’t fit on the shelves or don’t like I gave away to my little sister 

I ended up giving my sister literally 40 pounds of products 

kitchen -

I aimed for absolute bare counters 

I ended up with only a blender and a soap dispenser (: 

I went through every food and condensed it down to 1 cabinet, 

if it wasn’t the noodle style I liked, if I did not like it, if it was too unhealthy, if I had duplicate spices, or didn’t like the spice, if it’s too hard to prepare, if I haven’t opened it and have no intention of opening it I gave it to my boyfriend

I went through cups and bowls and if they weren’t easy to clean and microwave safe I gave them away, same with pans

If I don’t like the cup because it’s ugly or a bad texture I gave it away, 

I got rid of duplicate utensils I barely use like  can openers or apple cutters, shredders and anything that was ugly, had rust on it, etc 

the dollar tree has most kitchen utensils even some pans! So anything I didn’t see myself using I got rid of 

Cleaning products i condensed if I had multiple bottles and gave away the ones I didn’t like, and am still whittling down today, the most important thing is knowing what you have and moving towards multi cleaners 

living room

went through my cords, any obscure duplicates that I rarely use I got rid of, any broken cords or cords that don’t work half the time I trashed 

the rest I bundled up and put in separate see through organza bags, 

Medicine was easy, I put all the bandaids in one container, got rid of obscure rarely used duplicates, got rid of expired medication, got rid of anything I don’t use that could be found at the dollar store 

For board games, movies, party supplies, anything that can’t fit inside a drawer had to go

Desk area -

For my paperwork I got this accordion organizing file thing and separated by subject, took pictures of things I might but likely will never need and shredded the rest


I decided through out this process I would use the last of the barely left candles so that took care of that

I got rid of any pens that didn’t work or that I don’t like, I got an organizer and any pen pencil marker that wouldn’t fit got trashed 

For books I allowed myself to keep 10, I rarely read as I enjoy audio books, I sold the rest on Facebook marketplace as bulk books 

Bedroom - 

My bedroom was mostly cluttered with furniture and decoration, I sold a few furniture pieces 

I took everything out of my room except for my bed and my desk then I only put back things I seen myself using rather than just trying to fit them in 

I got rid of picture frames expect for my favorite 3 and hung the pictures on the fridge instead 

Closet- 

I got an over the door shoe  organizer and any that don’t fit I gave away

I only kept plain ankle socks that were black and fuzzy socks I have the match for 

Only kept comfy bras 

Got rid of clothes that don’t fit, or are hard to wear, or don’t flatter me

I changed my wardrobe to only specific colors because I was tired of only having one shirt that matched a given pair of pants

I stuck to gold jewelry and got rid of any silver or tarnished jewelry 

anything I wore, all jewelry I wore, it all matched. I didn’t have to think much about what I wore, it all just went, some things go better with others but I didn’t have to search for the one shirt that matches the one pants, since everything flattered me I had to change less 

—————————————————

I’m well aware that I’m not a complete minimalist, I don’t only have 100 items, and Not everything I have is white.. but minimalism changed my life, 

I barely spend anytime cleaning because I don’t have many surface things, and what I do have has homes

Maximalism is great for some but it wasn’t great for me, it just got so overwhelming and I didn’t know what to do, I couldn’t keep my apartment clean, and I was constantly unsatisfied with my place, it sucked so much time from me 

You need to view stuff as disposable, that unfinished lotion that you hate the smell of is disposable, those tarnished earrings are disposable, that candle that’s out is disposable

don’t worry about getting rid of cheap and accessible things, if you can get it at the dollar store, and you never think you’ll use it get rid of it 

gifts- it’s hard to not accumulate things when you get so many physical gifts, If they’re really meant for me and I like it I keep it, but if it’s something I barely like and is a gift just because they have to give you a gift I try to regift, 

I leave in the package and put a sticky note from who I got it from, things like candles, perfumes, Mugs etc are great for it 

I only regift if I think they will genuinely enjoy it, & I never regift to anyone associated with who I got it from! 

I keep them in a drawer and it’s also a great stash in case you forget to get a gift for someone !

Things are meant to provide you value, not take away value from your life, 

Think about the item upkeep, get rid of things that aren’t worth the upkeep - certain pants that collect dog hair, plants that you can never seem to keep alive, lamps that you always have to change the bulb, lights where you always have to change the batteries, cups that aren’t dishwasher safe, shag rugs that are impossible to clean, shoes that always get dirty,  

I hope this helps someone else!

"After not living in my apartment for 8 months, decluttering feels far easier","Last January I had to drop from school for the rest of the semester because of health issues, and my school apartment sat empty for the rest of the winter all the way to the next autumn. During this time, me and my partner had discovered a mutual dream: Moving into an RV. Which means that everything that isn't necessary *has to go*.

 I had been trying to slowly and gradually reduce the amount of stuff in my life earlier - I had made it a rule of thumb that every time I move to a new place, I'd have at least one box of stuff less than I did last time. But now that we're planning to fit the whole life and material property of *two* people into one vehicle, just one box less isn't going to do.

 Having needed *nothing* from here for six months gave me a lot of much welcome clarity on how little of my property I actually used. Why do I have three large cabinets full of stuff that I haven't used in half a year? Why do I own *two* white tablecloths when I don't own *a table*?

 Before this, my decluttering has been mainly stuff that's *completely* useless, just junk, which is easy to let go of. Now I'll need to start with stuff that's still *useful*, but not useful *to me*.

I've been at work of filling up a box to take to the flea market all day. Still most of the stuff I find from my cabinets is literally just trash - things too broken to fix, ""important papers"" that were never important at all, broken art tools and dried-up and expired things - but the flea market box is slowly filling up as well, things that I do not use but someone else could have a better use for.

 For years I've looked at this stuff and thought ""meh, I'll go through them eventually, one day"". And 'one day' is today.

Feels *really* good.",declutter,1629635671.0
