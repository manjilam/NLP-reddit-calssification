Kitchen Before and After,"I've finally finished decluttering and cleaning my kitchen, heres the finished result! 

I've also managed to clear out more of my daughter's clothes (sold on Facebook) and decluttered under my bed. We have an ottoman bed which was full of junk and is now full of less junk. 2 bags to donate to charity, 1 book collection (18 books) to sell on eBay.

Slowly getting through things to do, been delayed with writing an essay for university today and my broken toe :(

How is there still so much stuff?!,"I‚Äôve been decluttering all of 2020, as well as making small changes 5 years previous to this. In the last 3 months I‚Äôve gotten rid of probably double the amount of stuff I did during the first lock down! How is this even possible? There‚Äôs less stuff to get rid of! The less I have the less I want! My other half is getting into it too which is a blessing but seriously how did I ever accumulate so much s**t????!!!! 

I‚Äôve come to the conclusion i was far better at organising and hiding my hoard than I‚Äôve ever given myself credit (shame) for!",declutter,1609607009.0

Clothes that fit but are old/aren‚Äôt me anymore,"Update: 
So I listed 4 dresses to the free site in my area and found some nice things I forgot I have!!! Separating stuff now that I‚Äôll just donate and not sort. The satisfaction from finding the couple nice lost gems has motivated me to go through more clothes! Thanks for everyone‚Äôs great advice. 

OP: 
So I‚Äôm now 24 but still fit the clothes I‚Äôve had since middle school. This makes it so so so hard to de clutter any clothes because I still ‚Äúfit‚Äù everything. I still have my old party dresses from bar mitzvahs I only wore once,but I don‚Äôt want to get rid of them because they still fit and are in like new condition. But I don‚Äôt want to be wearing a dress cut for a teenager on my adult body. But in my mind even tho I know I‚Äôm not going to wear these childish dresses, they still fit and are like new. I‚Äôm telling myself to give them away on the local free fb page but it‚Äôs hard. I have countless other clothing items like that too. Old travel t shirts and stuff that fits but look childish/old. Oh and how could I forget old tacky looking purses (my taste in accessories has changed since 14). Give me the motivation to get rid of them please . My room is really so cluttered I feel crippling overwhelmed.",declutter,1610106336.0

The sticker method is a game changer when it comes to decluttering. Hands down it has changed my life. Here's how it works.,"I heard this tip ages ago from Alton Brown on one of his cooking shows.  I thought it was genius and it has stuck with me for years.  Just wanted to share as I get ready to do another round of sticker-ing in January!

* Put (easy-peel) stickers on items at the beginning of the year/quarter/your birthday/some eventful date.
* Remove stickers on items when you use it during the year/quarter/time period you specified.
* When you get to the end of the year/time-specified, for items that still have stickers, realize you haven't use that item in a year and get rid of it or at least think hard about if you really want to keep it around another year since it's not adding value to your life.

Alton Brown does this with his kitchenwares.  He stickers lots of his kitchen items at the beginning of the year.  He even told this story on the show about how, mid-year, he'll see ""that purple sticker still on my beloved mixer"" and he'll force himself to find something to bake just so he can use the mixer and justify keeping it.  (His rule is that if the item still has a sticker at the end of the year, it goes.)

You can also write the month/date on the sticker to remind yourself when you attached it. (Too much work for me, I just write down the date and a specific color in my planner.)

When I do use an item and take the sticker off, I find I receive great satisfaction and joy from this act.

I don't sticker my entire house, but I do sticker certain categories of items that seem to get out of hand.  It's the stuff you don't use every day.  Electronics. Office supplies.  Holiday decor.  Ribbon/wrapping paper.  Shoes.  Coats.  The top of my closet.  The back of the cleaning supplies closet.  That cabinet above the refrigerator that is hard to reach.

One year I'll use purple stickers, the next year I'll use yellow stickers.  One year I don't think about coats.  The next year I'll think, ""Are the coats getting out of hand? Let's sticker them and find out.""

If I start to sticker items in January and an item already has two stickers?  That thing hasn't been used in 2 years!  My brain is rational in these moments: ""It's okay to let this go u/telladifferentstory.  Let someone else find joy in this item and use it for its intended purpose.  Let the item have joy and the new owner have joy.""

Even better, I sticker things in January and then notice in October that 60% of the stickers in my closet are still up.  All of the sudden my eyes are wide open.  üëÄ I end up going on a massive decluttering spree and getting rid of a bunch of stuff as I just realized I don't even touch a majority of my closet.  Seeing colored stickers all over your closet in October is a wake up call.

Final note, the stickers don't have to be big.  Even just a ""mini dot"" sticker put on the center of the hanger (under the hook) or on the sizing tag of a coat will work.",declutter,1610237224.0
2020 achievements - $4000+ sold and 10 garbage bags.,"Just wanted to share my decluttering success story from 2020.

I had a major decluttering in 2019 before but I continued to declutter in 2020.

With the pandemic, I made a small project out of selling on ebay. And have earned over $4000 dollars getting rid of stuff. I also got rid of an additional 10 garbage bags worth of stuff over the year.

I have been relatively busy as I am an essential worker so this is a result of doing things in my free time; about a hour a week outside of an initial  selling push during the first pandemic lockdown, I continued to post about 1 or 2 items a week.
To be honest I don't feel like I dedicate too much time to this endeavor. 

For those of you who have never sold anything on ebay or online I challenge you to try selling one item.

 The extra cash really helps and you will look at things differently. You will also be surprised at what you own has value I think the big mind set hump you have to get over is doing the leg work of understanding shipping , having shipping tape on hand and printing labels in case you don't have access to a printer. That is why I recommend selling a single item in order to get your brain to learn the different small steps that people gloss over when they say. ""just sell it on ebay""

In 2021 I will look to continue this habit of decluttering. I have sold about $100 dollars so far.",declutter,1610385059.0
Major closet purge,"I‚Äôve always been fat. Working on it. I lost 40 lbs and got a big breast reduction for medical reasons. I hadn‚Äôt really gone shopping for a few years as my size creeped up ‚Äî I‚Äôd just buy a new pair of jeans and live in my same beat up t shirts that were all tents anyway. 

BUT NOW I bit the bullet and went through everything I own from underwear and bras to all tops and bottoms to fancy dresses and holiday novelty items and coats and gloves. 

I got rid of, let‚Äôs say, something like 200+ items? Offered a bunch to friends and acquaintances. Anything they don‚Äôt keep will go to a local DV charity. 

Sometimes I look at my empty shelves and bare hangers and feel a bit of panic but usually I just feel an immense sense of freedom and possibility.

ETA: Thanks for the award! You made my day! I was feeling sort of anxious with, like, an emotional hangover(?) from last night's closet ordeal, but your support has made me feel so strong and hopeful.",declutter,1610457159.0
How do I stop feeling guilty over throwing clothes away?,"I'm a recovering hoarder. I am voluntarily on therapy and medication.  I try to adhere to the 2 things leave for every 1 thing bought. I can do this with my clothes easily but I struggle so bad when it comes to baby clothes. I have 3 girls in different sizes and a baby due in March.

I decided to kick off the New Year by gathering all baby clothes and doing the ' shock treatment'. I have them sorted by size and discarded clothes that were heavily stained and used the Marie Kondo method as well. All in all the clothes fit into 6 bulk diaper boxes, like the month supply boxes. One box for each size

I'm struggling so bad with guilt and regrets now.   I keep trying to tell myself I did the right thing. That I am breaking family cycles every time I let something go, and giving my girls the childhood I was robbed of due to hoarding. But the guilt is consuming me and I want it to stop. Does anyone have any tips on how to make it stop?",declutter,1610538947.0
Hobbies that don't create more stuff,"I'm in a lockdown situation, and am realizing how many of my hobbies involve going places, eating, or creating things. I'm all for creativity, but as I declutter I don't want to be creating new things just for the sake of making them. Gifts are great, but I don't like gifting handmade clutter to other people since I hate it so much myself. So crochet, carving, pyrography, knitting, some sewing (still working on some upcycling projects), are all out. Trying to eat healthy and be a kind upstairs neighbor, so baking and instruments are not currently on my to-do list either.

Any thoughts? My biggest hobby the last few weeks has been decluttering, and I can only study so much Spanish.",declutter,1610569376.0
Getting rid of mountains of clothes,"I‚Äôve been really making an effort to get my finances in order this year.

I felt like I had wasted so much money over the past few years. But instead of beating myself up about it, I focused all my energy into sorting out stuff to donate and consign. I‚Äôve already made $160 and can hopefully double that this month. I feel so relieved and having extra cash on hand has been awesome. I was feeling so overwhelmed until I finally took the step forward that I needed.",declutter,1610635423.0
I finally cleaned and decluttered my room for the first time in almost 6 years!,"Hello all! 

As the title says, I finally got the motivation and pushed through my anxiety to clean and organize my room after almost 6 years.

I am 23 and have hoarding tendencies just like the rest of my family. 

With most things in my room, I'd have the usual justifications, ""oh this can be useful in a few years if I ever need it!"" 

And ""this outfit/shirt is sooo cute, ill save it for when I finally lose that last 15 pounds!"" (But, those times never came.) 

Or, ""but someone gave this gift to me that I dont really want, but ill keep it cause its the thought that counts!"" (I seriously had old dead dried up roses in my room from my 17th birthday just lying around on one of my dressers.)  

In early December 2020, I was looking around my room at what it had become. I personally hoard things like old boxes, papers, pens, SO many clothes with tags still on it, unused purchases from the dollar store, and old presents / gifts.
 Just the thought of going through everything in my room would absolutely overwhelm me and give me tons of anxiety. 

I used to have the mentality that if I cleaned something, it would HAVE to all be done in one day, or it would all need to be done quickly. Naturally, that's a super overwhelming prospect! 

I told myself that I can break it up into sections- just do one little spot every day. And if that day, i just didn't have the mental energy to do it, then I could take a break from cleaning and try to make a game plan for another spot instead. 

But for some reason in early December, I got the motivation and clarity to start on my room and do a total overhaul. (Though I will admit, I am fortunate where I only have to deal with my one room.) 

I started in one small corner of my room and was able to calmly think about what I'd do with the items in that spot. (For example: old alcohol flavoring, huge yoga mat, old boxes, an unopened/unused bidet, and a suitcase) and I came up with organization ideas for about 5 or 6 items and actually took care of them the next day! 

That continued for the next month! 

In total, I ended up getting rid of 7 bags of clothes, 4 bags of random donate stuff, and probably 5 bags of just trash (paper and boxes). I consigned clothes, sold electronics and random stuff. The rest, I was able to donate or give away. It was an incredibly therapeutic feeling and so freeing! 

My closet was the worst spot in my room. It had blankets, comforters and 9 pillows on about 1/3rd of the closet that took up much room. The rest had clothes, trash, papers and boxes. It took me about a week to tackle and clean the whole thing. I can proudly now say that its actually a closet I can actually use and walk into! The floor before was completely covered. It all went up to my hips at least. 

The closet was a major source of anxiety for me. I actually originally planned to do everything else BUT my closet, it was so bad! But I was on a roll with the rest of my room and mustered up the courage to tackle it and pushed though my anxiety. 

Now, a month later, my room is 99% done, just a few detail spots I'm trying to finish. I also purchased some bookshelves that helped immensely! (I had tons of books and movies that I had stacked along my walls in random places.) 

I'm really sorry, this got a bit longer than I anticipated it to be, and kinda jumps around a lot. If you read the whole thing, thank you so much! 

If anyone has any questions or clarifications, I'd love to answer!",declutter,1610745326.0

In thanks to Freecycle.org,"In less than two weeks I will be moving from my home of 30 years to take care of family. It's an incredibly stressful time. According to my moving company I need to get the weight of my belongings down to keep it affordable.

I've been using [freecycle.org](https://freecycle.org) and making posts. Possessions that were heavy albatrosses, that I thought no one would want, have been flying out the door. Watching my pile of stuff, that I finally realized I can live without, shrink daily has been making me feel lighter. I didn't want to try to sell my belongings for a few dollars and wait for buyers, I just wanted things gone. So far, everyone I've dealt with has been kind and appreciative for the objects I've been letting go.

After years of accumulating, certainly things I have needed at the time, it feels good to let go. For all that, I'm calling it a success.

"Another thank you, this time for professional shredding companies","I wish I had saved the original post where someone made the recommendation, so I could give proper thanks.

I'm moving next week after being in my place for 30 years. My big clutter nemesis has always been paper. Old bills, insurance statements, ancient tax forms, credit card offers etc. It just got away from me and now I am drowning in a mountain of paper. I tried to go through it all shred the important bits, recycle the unimportant stuff, but it was still causing my shredder to overheat and the recycle bin to overflow. It's so loud and time consuming.

Today I went to a professional shredding company with 3 banker boxes full of stuff and they shredded it all in front of me in about 3 minutes. It cost $20. So worth it. While I was there I found out they would shred my old hard drives. I think I'm in love. Especially when you watch it all be destroyed and don't have to worry about someone getting your sensitive info.

So grateful for my TaskRabbit Organizer,"Sometimes you need to admit that you need help. I'm getting ready to move from my home of 30 years to take care of my family on another coast. To describe it as stressful doesn't even come close. My friends have been amazing, but sometimes you need to call in a professional. I looked through a bunch of TaskRabbit profiles and found someone who seemed to fit my needs and I liked her unusual picture so much I thought, ""even if today is a bust, at least we'll have something interesting to talk about"".

She came in like a big ball of sunshine. We went through my closets and in a couple of hours had cut my wardrobe  in half. Then, and this is the best part, she hauled away everything that I didn't want (7 big bags). I wasn't left to ponder what to do with everything, it was just gone. She was so nonjudgmental and stayed focused on the task. Whenever I dithered she asked a few pointed questions and got us back to business.

It worked out so well that two days before move day I have her coming back to help me pack. 

The intense sense of relief of letting things go, and knowing that I won't be burdened with them anymore has been incredible. When you stay in a place so long you can begin to be weighed down by stuff. It happens so gradually you don't even notice. Then when you have to suddenly let go and get moving it's overwhelming. There is no shame in asking for help. It was the best $100 I've ever spent. My only regret is in not doing it sooner.",declutter,1611436183.0
"Moving makes this so, so easy.","Any other time and I end up thinking ""Well, what if we need it again later?"" 

But moving? Everything's different. It then becomes ""How badly do I want to haul this over on top of all the other shit I'm hauling over?""

Then that turns into ""I don't want to pack, move, and unpack this shit.""

Magically, I have way less shit now.",declutter,1611644746.0

Cleaning out my closet just saved me ~$45 in new hanger purchases,"Since I began seriously decluttering during the pandemic, I‚Äôve payed more attention to my space and what I own, and my boyfriend and I decided that all matching wooden hangers would be a beautiful yet simple upgrade to our shared closet. We‚Äôre both grad students though and couldn‚Äôt justify spending $120+ just on hangers when the plastic mismatched ones we have work fine.

So, I counted the number of hangers we were using before we started to declutter, and kept tabs on them as we went through our stuff. As of today, we‚Äôve freed up 45 hangers! We‚Äôve been planning to get the 24-packs of hangers from Target, plus a few loose extras, so this just saved us at least $45 since we don‚Äôt need as many packs now. Plus, we gave away the newly freed hangers to someone on Facebook marketplace for free and they seemed really grateful. Win win! 

All this to say, if you‚Äôve been thinking about hanger upgrades, save some money and do it after you clear out your closet! I‚Äôve found that picturing my closet with nice new hangers has helped me be more honest about what I actually want to see on them.",declutter,1611849136.0
Decluttering: tried to sell them on ebay but gave up,"Hey I am decluttering my student room, which is full of books, dvds and blurays. I looked it up, an devided them into worth and nothing worth. The ones i wouldn‚Äòt get any money, it just donated to Bodo (it‚Äòs a German thing) and tried to sell the rest of it on ebay. But it was so exhausting and after 2 weeks i sold like 5 books, 2 dvds and 4 blurays. I gave up and was about to toss them all out. Then I found out about rebuy (also a German thing) and that you can just pick out everything you want to sell (books, movies, electronics etc.) and they give you a price, which depends on the condition. So I did that, and voila:  they took like 300 pieces, I just had to send them (for free, they pay for shipping) all the stuff and the amount of packages is also no problem. I got like 800‚Ç¨ and got rid of them. I would probably get more if I sold them by myself but it would just take so mich time, and all of the stuff would be just sitting here in my room, waiting to get sold.

"I found my white whale, finally! A simple routine to keep my house clean and clutter-free.","A few weeks ago, I asked for your input on decluttering my whole life. I Konmaried a lot, and decluttered, and did a 30-day challenge. I still have a lot of stuff to declutter and organize but I made some significant improvement. 

The thing is, I've always been pretty good at big projects. I handled moving 2 apartments in our house, I re-did the entire back porch, painted the staircase, reorganized the rooms to WFM. What I am not so good at, is keep the place uncluttered and clean, without having to do a major cleaning day on weekends. My husband is actually the one to most of the house care. It was creating friction and I had to do something. 

So I said to myself, fudge it, let's just try something. Anything. No more searching for the perfect routine or a magic formula that would keep the place looking like a magazine. I just need to do something. 

So I started to full and start the dishwasher every evening before bed. Since the countertops were now empty, I quickly wiped them, and wiped the counters in the half-bath. The first day, it took me at least 15 minutes, the second days, 10 minutes. Now,it takes barely 5 minutes. 

In the morning, I empty the dishwasher while waiting for my coffee. It takes 3 minutes, since it's a half-load. It's way less daunting than an overflowing 3 days of dishes and silverware full load! Then I pick-up the clutter and wipe the counters in the up-stair bathroom while doing my skincare routine. That's another 3 minutes. Finally, I do a 5 minutes tidy up of the main floor. Anything that's out of place, I put back in its place. 

The first day, it made very little difference. There was still winter coats, hats and gloves on the dining room table, and craft stuff on the couch, shoes everywhere and books on the floor. On the second day, the couch was empty and the mudroom was clear. On the third day, the mail was in its place, the flyers in the recycle bin, and there was nothing on the floor! 

On the fifth day, I had to go to the basement to find enough stuff and clutter to finish my five minutes of tidying. It was glorious to think that my living room, kitchen, dining room, half bath and mudroom were clean enough that I HAD NOTHING TO TIDY. Not a thing. That is exactly when it clicked for me. That was it. I could do 3 things in the morning and 3 things in the evening, barely 10 to 15 minutes each time and keep a decent and organize house. 

Is it as clean as my mother's house? Nope. The baseboard are dusty, there is dog hair on the furniture and I keep losing the remote. But it's way better. I can open the door without being embarrassed. I can have someone over without going into panic mode.  It's very motivating. It's easy to keep going. It's, most of all, working for me.",declutter,1612205300.0
"After realizing how much more calming my decluttered home felt, I decluttered my classroom.","I‚Äôve spent the last month donating and throwing away literally hundreds of pieces of clothing and items from my home. I have felt this great sense of peace now that my house is decluttered, but when I returned to work I started to feel suffocated by my classroom. 

I had mismatched bins filled to the brim with supplies on every cabinet, tons of old student work and posters all over the walls, outdated books shoved into every space I could fill, etc. I wondered if my students felt overwhelmed by my room and could even focus on what was on the board when there were a million other distractions around my room. 

So I spent this week cleaning, reorganizing, and decluttering. My room looks amazing. I still kept it interesting and colorful, but it‚Äôs not so in-your-face now. I was able to make enough room to move the stuff that was stored in plain sight into matching bins inside the cabinets. Now I can just take out the supplies when we need them and put them back when done. Rather than having student work scattered throughout the room, I designated one small bulletin board for it. All the posters and distractions that were around my main board are gone so that when students are taking notes they can (hopefully) better focus on the material. I threw away things I haven‚Äôt touched in 10 years. 

Overall I‚Äôm so happy I started this decluttering journey. It‚Äôs a relief to have calming spaces both at home and at work. I hope my students feel the same.",declutter,1612407039.0
"Just because my mom did it that way, doesn‚Äôt mean I have to!","Every so often I have a moment with myself where I cure a frustration inducing clutter trap by having the same revelation. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre keeping this stuff that is causing you frustration because mom taught you to keep everything, but there is a better way.‚Äù 

Most recently this applied to my dish rags and dish towels. We had received more than our small kitchen could hold of various types, materials and sizes when we married. The drawer wouldn‚Äôt shut, I hated using half of them, just - ugh! Then I realized I was only hanging onto them because replacing them with rags I enjoyed using felt ‚Äúwasteful‚Äù. 

So I kept the two I liked, donated the rags in good shape, tossed the grody ones, and bought a 10 pack of the rags I liked best. Now I have 12 dish clothes, and only the cute/functional towels in an amount that fit comfortably in my drawer!! No more cramming! 

I‚Äôve applied this to Tupperware, craft supplies, wal mart sacks, and several other categories. I‚Äôm sure there are so many other areas I will eventually have the same revelation with, but it always feels a bit freeing.",declutter,1612572867.0
Finally realized my mom‚Äôs voice inside my head is why I was holding on to so much stuff for so long,"There are some items I‚Äôve been carrying around for years: from dorm to apartment to the next apartment to the next to my first rental house and then now I‚Äôm finally in my first home.

We bought a fixer upper, and have slowly been transforming it into our own over the last year. This has forced me to confront boxes I‚Äôve moved time after time, but always dreaded unpacking (and some that didn‚Äôt get unpacked for a few moves).

I have a bulky, huge white jewelry box that was gifted to me as a teenager. I remember the disappointment I felt when I opened it (mostly because as a teen I wasn‚Äôt interested in jewelry) but I remember the excitement in my mother‚Äôs voice asking if I liked it. I‚Äôm now almost 27 years old and have been lugging it around for over ten years. It doesn‚Äôt match anything and it doesn‚Äôt have much in it. My expensive jewelry is in a delicate and lovely hand painted jewelry box that was a gift from my husband. Today, it finally clicked ‚ÄúI keep this for my mom, not for me‚Äù and I plan to donate it. 

Then, I realized there are a lot of items I‚Äôve carried for years because I always heard my mom gush over it (jewelry box) or talk about how much she liked it (a shirt that doesn‚Äôt fit quite right, but is otherwise cute that I make the mistake of forcing myself to wear like once a year and it doesn‚Äôt make me feel good/happy because it doesn‚Äôt fit right). I would much rather rehome, donate, or gift these items to people that will actually appreciate them rather than carry them around out of guilt.

This is my space and I want to surround it in the things I pick out or enjoy- and for me that means less things. Less clutter. My mom doesn‚Äôt live here, so even though the gifts were sweet, it was a gift and not an obligation.

Space was sacred, and my brother, ""Danny"" and I had been conditioned from a young age to declutter, so even when we were kids, we hardly ever came home with paper or trinkets or things we didn't need. This is about Danny, who although knew how to clutter, he had not yet learned the delicate concept of ""tact.""

One day after church, when Danny was about five, his Sunday School teacher comes up to my parents, looking quite upset. She asked woefully, ""Does Danny hate me?""

My parents looked at each other, confused. No, they reassured her, Danny loves you, he always tells us that he got to color cool pictures in your class.

""Then why does he always throw out the drawings after class?""

Danny's teacher worked so hard on making coloring pages for her students, but Danny was so good at decluttering that after spending Sunday School happily coloring,  as soon as class was over he would say goodbye to his teacher, throw the paper in the trash in front of her, and walk out.

That gave my parents a good laugh. They had taught him well. A little too well.",declutter,1612661253.0
I had a revelation this weekend,"Like many of you, I get overwhelmed with clutter. A lot of things are stuff I bought years ago---things from childhood, from my 20s, 30s, and 40s (I'm 50 now).

I had a revelation. If I buy something today at age 50, would I expect myself to hang onto it for the next 30 years? Do I want my 80-year-old self to hold onto things I don't use, simply because I bought it 30 years ago? Of course not! Things I buy today are meant to be used now. If I have something worth holding on to, I'll keep---but why would I want my future self to be burdened with things from my younger self?  


I am giving myself the same grace for my past self. Jewelry, stuff I had as a kid and in my younger years---I'm sure my past self wouldn't have expected me to hold onto everything for 30 years! It's ok to let go. 

I will be going through my stuff now with a more critical eye--and I hope this makes it easier for me to let go of crap I truly don't need anymore.",declutter,1612734015.0

Don't forget as you declutter your physical life to declutter your online life too! It's just as satisfying.,"Go through your subreddits and un-join everything that doesn't bring you joy (or do it one at a time as they show up on your feed). Could be ones you used to need for info or whatever and don't need anymore, could be ones that have too much drama/negativity, could be ones you thought would be cooler when you joined them and aren't actually that interesting. Free up your feed for stuff you actually like! 

Do this on Facebook and Insta and everywhere else, too. Unfollow (or unfriend) people who aren't an important part of your life. Personally, I use this rubric: if I saw this person in a crowded place like a mall or walking between classes at the university or whatever, and if they were more than 50 ft/15 m away from me, would I care enough to call out to them loud enough to say hi? Or would I avert my eyes and pretend I don't see them so I don't have to expend the energy? I unfriend everyone who doesn't pass, even if I used to like them. Humans aren't meant to have to hold onto 3,000 old friends from times past. YMMV, this rubric works for me but you might come up with a different one. Get rid of pages that make you compare yourself to them or that fill you with consumer-related desire. And hell, if you're feeling up to it, delete your profiles altogether! But even if you don't go that far, you can still clean it out. 

Get rid of old notes on your phone, clear out your Google drive, reorganize and merge and clean out your Pinterest boards! 

Honestly it is so wonderful to free up all that mental and emotional space, and to let go of old things and connections. Set yourself free.",declutter,1612949748.0
Decluttering my stuff led to decluttering my relationships.,"I did a big declutter a few weeks ago, which obviously feels really good. Cleaned out my closets, reorganized my music gear, gave away a bunch of toiletries and makeup. 

But I also decluttered (unfollowed) over 250 accounts on Instagram the other night. 

There also had been conflict building up with my roommate‚Äôs compulsion to take up a lot of space for the past year, and I finally got to set boundaries with her. Let‚Äôs just say I am finally able to buy and cook my own food because there is room in the fridge again! 

And I also confronted and forgave a spiritual mentor who was manipulative and hurtful to me after holding quiet resentment for over a year. 

And OH MY GOSH YOU GUYS I feel like a new person. I think that decluttering my physical space made me see the other things (people) in my life that were encroaching on my inner well-being. Actually following through and setting boundaries was hard but absolutely worth it.",declutter,1612979548.0
"idk who needs to hear this but if you are holding on to clothes that you‚Äôll ‚Äúget tailored one day‚Äù or fixed for years, the invisible chains have broken and you are now free to donate them!","If you still can‚Äôt let go just yet, put a sticky note on the article of clothing with what needs to be tailored/fixed by X date. Hold yourself accountable and if you don‚Äôt get it done by that date, donate it. 

A few more things to keep in mind:

It has been sitting so long that you may not even like the style/colour/cut/fabric anymore. Or it may have even degraded from improper storage. 

You are more likely to go out and buy something that reflects your current style. Your past self may have liked it and thought it was beautiful, but do YOU right now, in this moment feel it reflects your current style?

You obviously don‚Äôt like it THAT much if it has been the absolutely last thing on your to do list since forever 

You probably don‚Äôt need it and wear something else anyways

Sometimes we hold on to clothing because we like the colour or pattern, but not how it looks ON us. Unless it is displayed as art or something, take a picture of it then donate 

If you feel guilty about it, that‚Äôs your sign to donate it. Stop letting an inanimate object weigh you down with negative emotions",declutter,1613076088.0
"""Clutter is a Visual Sign of Procrastination""","I'm many years into decluttering so I've read a variety of resources by now, and I hear a lot of repetition of info/advice that I already know from most popular leaders the decluttering space. But, I just borrowed ""The More of Less"" audiobook tonight and listened to it while decluttering all of my old college and grad school work and was surprised to hear the author say that clutter is a visual sign of procrastination.

I guess it's obvious in hindsight now, but I'm on top of my work and other parts of my life that I feel are important to me and I've always been a stickler about time, so it's amusing that I don't see myself as the typical definition of a procrastinator. But, it's so true and fair that my clutter shows that I haven't valued my living space and that I've been procrastinating on upkeep there. Before the pandemic, I've always valued going out to staying in. Since I moved cross-country so much before, I never had a chance for clutter to really become an issue. My mom was a hoarder, so I valued not owning much when I was younger and loved the freeing feeling of moving easily. When I first moved to where I live now, I recall the first 3 years were still good, but once I realized I wanted to stay in my current area for the long-term that's when my possessions creeped up.

What's helping to keep me motivated to declutter is I'm passively planning to move to a different home within the same area in maybe 1-2 years, so I don't want the move to be difficult whenever it happens. Not sure if this inspo will help others, but just sharing in case it clicks.",declutter,1613290443.0
Slow progress is still progress,"I have been working since March to declutter my living space and get rid of unused and unwanted stuff. The amount of clothes I got rid of in 2020 has been huge. Recently, my living situation has changed, and I realized I still have too many clothes. I will be moving somewhere new yet again in about a month, and I want to continue to thin out the amount of clothes I have. My mother has accumulated clothes and shoes to the point where you could almost call it hoarding; random piles throughout my parents' house, some that haven't been touched for a decade or more...I don't want to become like that. I want to continue to cultivate a household and lifestyle that I can feel proud of. So I am happy to announce I am donating another bin of clothes and shoes this week! Remember, even if your progress in decluttering is slow, it is still progress and you deserve to feel proud of yourself.

My 7 year old is motivating,"So I have an almost 7 year old daughter.  She is like all (that I know of)  kids and keeps a lot of random things.  I tend to be the family purger.  However since she was 4, we talk a lot about how things are not really helping us feel better. How a clean room without a lot of extra stuff helps clear our mind.   

Her teacher this year for first grade puts a lot of emphasis on organization too.

So today I had to pick her up at school.  (She hurt her chin.) After urgent care, a Starbucks (a rare treat) and a nice nap, I find her in her room cleaning.  She gets done and for 7, she did a good job.  She got rid of several things. She pulled out her clothes and organized them by size and handed off a bunch that will go to her little sister. She sorted through her various treasures  (McDonald's toys. Valentines. Various doctor/dentist prizes.... ) (Yes old valentines are garbage to me... but to her they are to be carefully considered.)

When she was done, she looked around and said, ""I needed this.  I feel better.""

I came out and started going through crap that has piled up on our dresser because she absolutely right.  Clutter makes me feel tense.  And getting rid of it is liberating.

Old grade school papers and notebooks comprise 80% of my clutter. Bad school memories also make up 80% of my intrusive thoughts and nightmares.,"I was decluttering my room for *""the last time""* today, and I just realized this. It can't be a coincidence... can it?

&#x200B;

I have a nightmare about school memories at least once a week: teacher's face, teacher's name, procrastination, social troubles, the bullying, and more. Yet, at the same time, I struggle to throw away things like old essays and all my notebooks.

* I think they might be useful someday.
* Good or bad, the uniform is still a memory, so we should keep it, cause we should be able to keep memories that I don't agree with.
* The teacher that I was afraid of, and/or hurt me, gave me a good score on that essay, so I should keep it.
* I might need some binders in the future.
* The teacher wrote criticism on that paper for incompletion or tardy submission. It doesn't feel good to look at.
* I was Student of the Month that one time, but my teacher avoided me completely that day. He looked mad at me. Let's keep the award paper anyway.
* Keep the awards. What if I need to show them to someone someday?
* I should keep that discipline paper I got, on the day where a teacher and my parents lectured me for skipping the 2 hr Tues/Thurs/Sat SAT prep after school sessions... and Dad talked about being fed up and loving to move far away from us.
* Why do I not know what I should be proud of enough to display?

&#x200B;

I **hated** school. I discovered old writings where I'd literally describe why life wasn't worth living, at *10-years old*, and how unbearable school experiences were. I never knew ""depression"" was in my vocabulary. I was miserable.

School memories stress me out.

Yet I struggle to get rid of them. Physically.

I had 5 huge boxes of binders, folders, notebooks and worksheets. It was almost overwhelming but it‚Äôs amazing how much space cleared out in my home once I did. 

I actually forgot I even had these still, I had stuffed them in the back of my storage. So I highly recommend decluttering and recycling it if you haven‚Äôt already.

Plato's Closet didn't take ANYTHING,"I've been decluttering some clothes and I brought in a decent amount of stuff to Plato's Closet, thinking I might make a couple of dollars before I give the rest to either Goodwill or Thread Up. However, Plato's Closet didn't take ANYTHING today and I was pretty disappointed. And while some of it I knew they wouldn't take, there was other stuff in there that was nice quality items and almost brand new. So I'm pretty disappointed in them. I took half of it to Goodwill and the rest I'm going to send to ThreadUp. Anyone have any similar stories or success stories with them?",declutter,1614477392.0
"Does anyone else feel like what they're throwing away is ""sentient""? (For lack of a better term)","I'm an ex-hoarder. I say ex because I can successfully declutter my space, and I'm even doing so more frequently so that when I eventually move out from my dad's house I don't have much to bring with me. I no longer own a lot, I own a normal amount, but I'm in a small room so it feels like a lot more than it actually is.

But whenever I go through my stuff and throw things away, it feels like I'm insulting it. For example, I just threw away a Mexican Coca Cola bottle, that I got from Chipotle, the restaurant. It's nothing special by any means. It was just the first time I had tried it and it was in a cool glass bottle. But it's not like it's a memory from a vacation I took, or anything related to a special event. It's just a glass bottle that I thought was cool. 

And I felt horrible throwing it away. Same for old things I drew when I was a kid that I know I don't want. Same for shoes that are worn out to the point of not even being able to donate them, same for toys from childhood that are special enough to keep that I pack away in boxes, same for anything that's not literal trash that I throw away. Even throwing away broken things sometimes feels disrespectful to them. 

It could be due to spiritual beliefs of mine but it feels more superstitious I suppose. I just feel like I'm insulting these things. I threw away a bottle of lotion I didn't use anymore and was years and years old, and felt like I was insulting the lotion bottle. Donating items doesn't give me this feeling because they'll at least go to someone else, so I try to donate everything I can, along with all of the other reasons to donate things of course. 

Does anyone else feel like the objects you're getting rid of have some sort of sentience towards you and you feel bad for insulting them by throwing them away? I'm aware that these objects aren't literally sentient, so it's not really something I'm worried about, just a weird feeling I can't shake sometimes. I can overcome it luckily, I just wanna hear if anyone else has this.

Delete those songs you keep skipping!,"This one is important! We overlook the things that we consume everyday and music can be very hard to let go of. Between my Apple Music and Spotify accounts I have almost 10,000 songs. I love love love music, but where do we draw the line? So after a quick week-long music fast, I started deleting songs left and right. I'm down to 4,818 right now after a week of intense mass decluttering! 

Yes, music can span a long time and some songs we hold dear to us, but how do we make room for the new things? Mind you, this was spur of the moment and pretty dang close to overwhelming, so I'd recommend deleting songs that you don't like or value as you come across them.

I just donated 3 car loads of stuff and filled a skip bin!,"So this isn‚Äôt all that interesting but I wanted to share with people that might share my excitement about letting go of things and decluttering! It‚Äôs a bit of a read, I tend to ramble on.           
        
I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm a hoarder, I hang on to a lot of things for either sentimental reasons or because I think I can use it later. I‚Äôm 22 and I‚Äôve already amassed a ridiculous amount of stuff.      
In the last 4 years I & my partner have moved house 6 times including interstate moves and we are about to move again (I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with us haha).     
We‚Äôre currently staying with my parents so aside from everyday items, all of our belongings are in their garage boxed up.     
     
In all of these moves, I‚Äôve been holding onto things for different reasons- because I could use it at some point, it‚Äôs sentimental, or just because I‚Äôve been too lazy to unpack boxes. We‚Äôve never fully unpacked in any of the houses we lived in except the first.       
So I‚Äôve carted this stuff around from Queensland to New South Wales, to Victoria, back to New South Wales and now finally back to Victoria. It‚Äôs always been a huge hassle getting a big enough truck without being too expensive, and trying to fit everything in etc. but I‚Äôve still held on to the majority of our things.      
       
But this time my partner and I got into the garage and cleared it all out/packed everything up in two days!! I finally let go of a lot of things I‚Äôve been holding on to, and honestly I can‚Äôt remember most of what we got rid of.     
We also have toddler twins born in December and they receive a LOT of gifts for their birthday & Christmas. So there‚Äôs always a huge influx of things for them that time of the year. Going through it, there were a lot of toys, books, clothes (dear lord the clothes) and misc. baby stuff that they‚Äôve outgrown so we donated it to the local op shop. (All in good condition, anything that was stained, broken, missing pieces etc. was tossed in the skip). They still have a lot of things but it‚Äôs more manageable now. 
I decluttered a few months ago and donated 7 garbage bags of things, but this time we were ruthless!      
I feel so much better, and the move itself doesn‚Äôt seem as bad- and I hate moving haha.      
I don‚Äôt want to unpack anything now that it‚Äôs neatly stacked waiting for the moving truck, but once we‚Äôre in our new place I‚Äôve already decided I‚Äôm doing another cull.

How prison penpals helped me become more ruthless with my declutter,"So 2 years ago I got myself some prison penpals. I was going through a phase in life where I felt disconnected from society, imprisoned within my four walls, and dealing with stigma, attached to a chronic illness. I figured, ""Who else could possibly relate to this?"" - which is where this came about.

I have made some great friends and become less judgemental as a person. I have also developed a healthier perspective on life.
Another unintentional benefit has been with my recent decluttering and sorting through my life.

While going through all my stuff recently, the thought occurred to me ""What happened to all their stuff once arrested or sentenced?"" - so I asked both my friends.

They both had the same answer.

All their stuff was gone. They had left what possessions they had in untrustworthy places, with untrustworthy people - such were the lifestyles they had been living prior to incarceration. They had more than likely been sold, stolen or whatever. Those people, places and things were no longer in their lives (in any capacity) and hadn't been for years. 

They just learnt to get on with it, shrug their shoulders. It was out of their control anyway. It was just stuff. They would have to start completely over once released. Virtually the same as someone starting over after a house fire.

The positive progress made and journey they have been on (without any possessions) is proof enough that we don't need most of the shit surrounding us, and the materialistic possessions we hold onto. 

It has certainly helped motivate me to become more ruthless in what I'm willing to get rid of, donate and sell, in my epic task of decluttering!

Kid‚Äôs art,"I had a breakthrough this week. I‚Äôve been holding on to 3 huge bins of my two daughters‚Äô art work and journals for the past 20 years! (One is 21, the other 17). I am very sentimental and it‚Äôs been a struggle but I knew it was too much to hold on to as my husband and I want to move overseas. I‚Äôm also not one to be able to just photograph the art and discard the real deal. 

Anyway, my daughter wanted to help me this week in my attic purge so I decided to pass her a bin of her old art work. She easily got rid of most of it and I pulled out a few special pieces I wanted for myself. (The rest we left for my other daughter who will be visiting soon from her home in Europe.)

My youngest‚Äôs ability to let go motivated me so much that I started in on my already minimalist living room and I weeded out some things I‚Äôd been holding onto that I didn‚Äôt really love.

"Sorted out my ""special box""","My mom kept what she called a ""special box"" for each me and my sibling - a rubbermaid tote filled with things she deemed ""special"" from when we were little - and she sent mine along with me when I moved to my own place. I finally reopened it this past weekend to sort through it, and I have to wonder what she was thinking! I kept only the obvious personal/sentimental items, and ditched things like candles from my first three birthdays, a baby name booklet, and worn-out baby dinner plates. Then since I had space in the box, I added two childhood dolls I decided to keep from another tote (donating the rest of the dolls box) and stashed it in a closet out of my way. 

Moral of the story - just because it's cute and sentimental to you, doesn't mean your kid will want to drag it around for life. And just because your parents kept it, doesn't mean you have to keep it when they pawn it off on you in adulthood.",declutter,1616530782.0

Anyone else hate the process required to sell/recycle/dispose of stuff?,"I have no problem with decluttering and determining what items in my life spark joy, but it's the process of selling/donating items that really gets me.

I don't have a FaceBook so I can't post to my local ""buy nothing"" group. It's just exhausting going to the thrift store and trying to deal with selling things on Ebay. It really emphasizes the extent to which I've held onto items that don't add value to my life.

"Inherited my grandparents house, hoarder mother won't let me get rid of anything","My grandparents left me their house and property after they passed away. My husband and I are overwhelmed to say the least. And for the record, I was ridiculously close to my grandparents and their deaths hit me *very* hard.

My husband and I lived in a 900 sqft house for 10 years and recently added a child who is now 2.5 years old. So we adopted a minimalist type mindset (not a true minimalist but we had to be very selective about what we kept in our house). My grandparents house is 3000 sqft and full of furniture and stuff. 

We don't mind some of their stuff and find a lot of the older things kind of awesome. What we want to keep, we have a spot for. 

But we're reaching a point that a lot of what is left we don't really want. We're packing the stuff up and putting it in our old house until things calm down (I'm currently 8.5 months pregnant with our second kid) but my mother is driving me crazy. She's expecting me to keep everything my grandparents had. An example: my grandfather was one of those decorative plate collectors back in the 80's and 90's. Their house had 217 plates on the walls. We packed up all but 13 because they are sentimental to me and they fit perfectly in an odd spot that we didn't know what to do with. 
My mother is insisting I keep A L L of these plates because ""they were grandpa's"". 

When I told her we didn't want to keep them and I was afraid they would be ruined in the extreme weather we have in our area, she was livid. She told me she wanted them. I told her fine. Although they will still get ruined at her house. She has nothing on her walls because you can't get to the walls. She has trails in her house because of her stuff, etc etc etc. And when *she* dies, guess who gets to go through it all? *Moi*.

Anyway.

I'm trying to tell her that we are keeping certain things that we like and that are important to us. My husband and I love history and genealogy and we are keeping unique things to make this house ours, like my great-great grandfather's tailoring tools and some blankets that were made by my great-grandmother and her mother in law, things like that. My husband and I don't mind and like I said, this house is ridiculously huge with lots of wall space. 

I know there is basically no reasoning with hoarders but Lord Almighty. Is there anything I can do? My mother has memory problems, but everything I want her to forget, she doesn't. She asked about some dolls that were packed away in some trunk that I haven't seen in 20 years and can't tell you where it currently is, but that these dolls needed to be pulled out and checked on and kept because they belonged to my great-grandmother's sister or aunt or something. Frankly, I don't give a damn about them. If there is a family member that wants them, I'd be glad to give them to that person but my mother seems to think our side needs to be some ""heirloom"" protector??? Idk.

Finally got rid of most of my wedding decorations (small victory),"I got married a few years ago and bought rather than rented most of my decor.

However, I didnt get to it and who knows when weddings are going to start getting back to normal. I also didnt want to throw the stuff out because its nice stuff and I felt like keeping it all together as a set was better.


So my spouse has been helping plan a fundraising event for the last few months. The other day he showed me the intended centerpieces for the event and they were very plain. It was a glass cylinder with a candle and some moss in it. So I suggested we dig out our old centerpieces out of storage and offer them to the planning committee (they are geodesic terrariums that can be filled similarly, very pinteresty). One thing led to another and soon our car was packed up with the centerpieces, table runners and chalkboard things (including a restaurant sized folding chalkboard thats just been sitting in my basement.) Well most of this stuff was a hit with the committee. So then they said ""okay we'll borrow this and that"" and I said ""no you misunderstood, you can have all this stuff and dispose of it however you want when you are done, all we ask is that you don't give it back to us."" They agreed to that as the terms. So now I'm happy all this ""stuff"" is getting a second use and most importantly, it is permanently out of my house!",declutter,1618754494.0

Recluttering,"Thought I would share a story about recluttering. In 2017 my house burned to the ground. We (my husband, myself and my dog) had 15 minutes to get out with our lives.

We lost EVERYTHING. We managed to remember our passports and one file of important papers, but that was it. We were the only owners of the house, lived there for 20 years, and I had put my heart, soul, time and money into getting it exactly right. (A month before the fire I took delivery on the bed frame I‚Äôd wanted my whole adult life.) What‚Äôs really weird is that I had been in a decluttering mode for a few months previously, and I was cleaning out the linen closet one day feeling frustrated by all the crap that had accumulated in corners, cubbies and closets over the years. I literally stopped mid-cleaning and thought ‚ÄúBe careful what you wish for.‚Äù 

After the fire, we were in rentals for a while, furnished or with rental furniture and I knew immediately there was no way I would literally replace what we had. We were underinsured for one thing (a whole ‚Äònother conversation), and much of what we had was original artwork, textiles, and antiques that I‚Äôd collected over decades. The worst was the loss of photos, letters and other memories. I still get weepy when I remember some random little thing. 

The first recluttering was clothes (minimum needed), computer, toiletries, prescriptions and bed linens. As things have settled, I have the great advantage of knowing what worked and what didn‚Äôt over many years and I‚Äôve focused in on things that I could use in multiple ways. Just a small example is buying a dozen white cotton flour sack towels. I could use those things for drying the dishes, washing the car, placemats, etc. And I still use them. Every day. They were $10 for a dozen and those things don‚Äôt die. You get the idea. So I made a sort of game out of questioning each purchase and it is truly amazing how little we really need. Many people generously donated things (that frankly were going to Goodwill anyway) and we‚Äôve gradually replaced those. 

What I‚Äôve also found out is that my husband is a jacket, backpack, and garage stuff hoarder. I had suspicions. üòâ

I don‚Äôt really have a point I guess...just a counterpoint to DEcluttering. And the true value of the things we possess. Included in my evacuation kit now is a container with every card, and sentimental thing I own now.

Dispose of your nail polish properly!,"This weekend, I had some extra time and decided to get a manicure and pedicure. While there, I had a come-to-Jesus moment where I admitted that I wasn't ever going to get around to using the nail polish I had at home. Every time I get my nails done, I just choose a polish they have in store, even when I schedule the appointment in advance. I'd honestly be better off throwing the nail polish away and using that drawer for something else.

But as I discovered, my city and probably most areas don't want you to throw your nail polish in the regular trash. Instead, you should take it to your local household hazardous waste center.

"Not gifting clutter - are diapers still a ""safe"" gift for a baby shower?","I don't have kids, but I heard quite a ways back that diapers are almost universally a ""safe"" gift for when you're going to a baby shower, are expected to bring something, and don't really know the people well enough.

The rationale I heard was that stores are almost always happy to exchange sizes / brands / etc. on those, even without a receipt. And even parents that use reusable diapers (which this person almost certainly isn't) frequently have some store-bought diapers hanging around for emergencies.

They got married in 1985. The iron stopped working sometime in the 90s. The best part? We moved halfway across the country in 1998. So as my Mom was packing, she picked up the BROKEN iron and thought, ""Yeah this will be good to drag across 1800km and put in the new house.""

Small tip for those who have trouble letting go of clothes,"I have way too many clothes. My problem is that I have a lot of clothes with ‚Äúpotential‚Äù.

Anyways I started going through my clothing and trying each piece on. What REALLY helped was audibly (not just thinking) saying to myself the reasons I didn‚Äôt love or care for this item. Just hearing myself say and not only think ‚ÄúThis shirt makes me feel sloppy and I hate the way it clings to my chest‚Äù made me realize how ridiculous it sounds to hold on to these things.

Does anyone else regret getting rid of childhood things?,"Up until the day before yesterday, for the past 20 years our tool shed in our yard has been used as extra storage, packed full of plastic bins with our (mine and my parents') things. We'd been wanting to clean it out for years so we could actually use it for what it is, and looking through the 15 big bins we discovered most of them were full of things from my childhood - papers and homework, toys, and books. Hundreds of books. Most of it was stuff I didn't even know we had hung onto

I picked out a few things I wanted to keep, and the rest we bagged to throw away. A lot of the items were damaged either by animals or weather so donating wasn't really an option. At the time it felt freeing, to be able to say ""oh everything in this bin and that can go"", but watching the garbage men collect everything off of our lawn this morning actually gave me a pit in my stomach. Now I'm sat here in tears because I just threw my entire childhood away and I regret it. Now I'm thinking we should've just kept everything in the shed, because even though I had no idea all of those things were even in there before the other day, keeping them safe would've been better than junking it all.

Decluttering (and cleaning) with ADHD is a pain in the a**...,"So today and tomorrow, I have tasked myself with cleaning our entire apartment before a (much needed) trip out of town. I'm talking floors, walls, and going through cabinets. It's easier to get my partner to ignore me tossing things if he's distracted. He doesn't care what I get rid of, mostly, as long as it's not his. (I might've put too much on myself here...)

Important to note, after conversations with my doctor, we opted to hold off on my medication until after vacation, due to, what I call ""the dip"". (When your ADD/ADHD medicine wears off, some go through a mood dip. Mine lasts about an hour to an hour and a half, and I'm right back to the perky self I am.) I'll be in Vegas, we don't want to be mood dipping for no reason.. Well anyways.

I've been working on cleaning for a little over an hour and I. Am. Overwhelmed.   
Pet hair everywhere, dust everywhere, cabinets a mess. I realized that I threw my mop head in the washer... and now I need it. 

So I tried to start going through some cabinets and ridding myself of things. Let me tell you, I'm over it. I've already determined I will never have a ""Better Homes and Gardens"" looking space. But I'm really struggling today. 

Also, I have a ""rule"" about my medicine. After a certain time I do not take it, because it pushes that dip too late into the evening and then the hunger comes and I end up eating too late. 

I have times where I have decluttered an entire closet (I even did my office and shared that here). But today I am really struggling...   
(Also my partner is still sleeping and he doesn't want to hear my woes right now. So I just wanted to vent it out somewhere.)

**Consideration #1: If you need this item in a year, will it occur to you that you already have one?**

Let's say you're debating whether to keep the gravy boat from Grandma Granger.  You've never used it, but you might need it in the future.

It's useful to imagine yourself a year from now hosting Thanksgiving dinner and actually needing that gravy boat. At that time, will you remember that you have this item packed away in some back closet? Will you take the time to pull it out and clean it?

Or will you forget all about it?

(I got this idea from *Decluttering at the Speed of Life!* by Dana K. White.)

**Consideration #2: How much money do you have?**

If you have to re-buy something in a year, will you have enough money to do so?

(Many decluttering experts scoff at this, but a chunk of America is poor.)

**Consideration #3: Do you already have one of these?**

When we declutter, we often discover duplicates and triplicates of various items. How many containers of garlic salt do I really need?  How many copies of *Crucial Conversations* do I need? (I have no idea how I ended up with two copies sitting on my bookcase.)

**Consideration #4: How expensive is this to replace?**

Spatulas cost very little to replace.  KitchenAid mixers cost a lot more.  All things being equal, declutter the inexpensive stuff first.

**Consideration #5: How hard is it to replace this?**

Family heirlooms are irreplaceable. A bread maker may be expensive, but it's easy to find a replacement.

**Consideration #6: How much space does it take?**

Couches take a ton of room. A dozen necklaces from Grandma occupy far less space. All things being equal, get rid of the big stuff first.

**Consideration #7: When is the last time you used this item?**

A good rule of thumb says that if you haven't used something for three months, it'll be another three months before you use it again.  So start decluttering the stuff you haven't used in over a year.

Note: Exceptions to this exist, like with seasonal clothing. Use good judgment.

**Consideration #8: You'll re-buy 5% of what you declutter**

When you declutter and downsize, you'll inevitably get rid of a few things and have to re-buy them later.  Will you be OK with re-purchasing 5% of the things you get rid of? Is it worth having the clutter gone right now?  Is it worth having that space reclaimed right now?

**Consideration #9: How bad is the clutter?**

Does clutter cover every kitchen counter and make it impossible to prepare food? Or are you looking to get rid of few things in a couple of cupboards?

The more clutter you have, the more you need to start getting rid of stuff.

**Consideration #10: Is this part of a hobby?**

I love reading books, buying them, and checking them out from the public library. Books are my hobby. As a result, I keep a lot more books than the average person.

In every other area of my life, I'm more of a minimalist.  I limit my clothes and exercise equipment and regularly use what I have.

So before you get rid of something, consider whether it's part of a current hobby. Be less strict about decluttering stuff for your hobby. And beware of [aspirational identities](/decluttering/reddit=1#tool-5-utility-vs-aspirational-identity) and future hobbies.",declutter,1621803249.0
Stop storing things for other people,"**tl;dr Your home is not a storage unit for stuff that other people might not even want.**

We often store things for other people, things someone just might want in the future. Maybe it‚Äôs a tricycle and tinker toys for nieces and nephews. Perhaps it‚Äôs baby clothes and burp cloths for grandchildren. But here‚Äôs the deal: It‚Äôs all still clutter.

We store these things in totes and bins and boxes in our garages and basements and storage units until there‚Äôs no space left.  We haul our cache of maybe-someday-someone-will-want-this stuff from apartment to apartment, from house to house.

Now, this will probably make me sound like a heartless booger (which I totally am!), but stop storing stuff for other people. Most likely, no one wants it. And if you‚Äôre certain someone does want it, just give it to them. Let them store their stuff.  Let them fill their basement or rent a storage unit.

If this sounds unreasonable, try turning the tables. Imagine asking other people to store stuff for long periods, stuff that you might not even want in the future. Sound silly, right?

Your home is not a storage unit for stuff that other people might not even want!

**Take action**: Inventory all of the stuff you‚Äôre keeping for other folks. Each day, reach out to one of these people and ask them if they still want the stuff. If they do, give it to them.

Reminder that stuff doesn't last forever.,"I wanted to share something I've been realizing lately. This is what I've told myself in the aftermath:

Let's start with art supplies-markers dry out. Tape becomes stuck to itself. Stickers lose their stickiness. Paint becomes clumpy. Paper gets yellow and brittle. If you're saving something ""just in case,"" and you've been hanging on for years, it's time to let go. 

Same can be said about clothing! Especially nowadays with fast fashion. The elastic in clothes made 5 years ago that I saved for my 2nd child is worn out. Plastic degrades. Ink fades. Humidity might creep into something, ruining it. Screenprinted designs crack on old shirts.

I really wish I had donated this stuff sooner to someone who could have used it and given it a second life rather than let it sit there and become garbage. But you live you learn I guess. Hope this is helpful to those of you working on decluttering.",declutter,1622317662.0
I am ready to cry and so angry I could break things,"We're seniors, supposed to move to a senior community to a cottage half the size of our home.  My husband has been putting this off for 3 years.  We could move into a cottage in 3 months, but he is ""not ready"" because he has so much stuff to get rid of, so we had to pass - again.

I mean I could put all my things (which I have downsized) into one small U-haul.  He would need a moving van (and I am not counting furniture).  He promises to get rid of things (he saves everything)  if he can't find something he buys a duplicate and won't get rid of the old one.  He has about 75 jars of nuts, bolts screws, etc and shelves of car stuff.  I just sorted the garden stuff - 3 full bottles of Bug be Gon, 2 of spectracide and about 6 other spray bottles of assorted insect killers.   Why he keeps buying it I don't understand.  He has a street rod in the basement he hasn't driven in 4 years.  He even has the worn out toys and books he had as a kid - and he is 80+ years old.   I try to pick out things he hasn't touched in 25 years and he still wont let me get rid of it.  He does things he wants to do, putter with mechanical items, build wooden boxes for fun, read, play on the computer on forums - anything but spending even one hour sorting things.  I get the same answer - tomorrow, or later or don't bug me about it.  I'm beginning to think he will never ever cooperate.

I have become so anxious and angry I want to scream.  I want out from under all this stuff, this house, these things on every shelf, closet and 3 workshops are a burden!

I threw out a ball that fell off our chandelier two years ago,"I finally let that damn ball go, knowing that I'm never going to get around to pulling out the ladder to reach the light, to glue it back on.

"Why are clothes so hard to declutter? It seems like a common issue in this thread. I have LOTS of clothes, honestly most of it isn't worn, some have never been worn.

Right now most of my clothes are on my bed, fresh from the laundry and waits for me to sort and put away or toss. I already have an idea of what's being donated and tossed. 

I think it's hard b/c I don't have many clothes that fit me right now. I've also spent a lot of money on clothes over the years and can't afford to waste money. I mainly wear pj's right now, even those need to be sorted. My favourite pair of sleep pants are 5 years old, should those be tossed? They are well loved to say the least.",declutter,1622742720.0
Tried a new way to declutter clothes,"Step 1- remove everything from your closet

Step 2- store it elsewhere

Step 3- every day, go dress from your out of the closet pile. If you wear something, you can put it back in your closet (after laundry of course), given that you felt confortable wearing it. If not, discard.

Step 4- repeat as many days as needed. You can match a piece of clothing from the ¬´¬†keeping¬†¬ª closet to complete an outfit from the ¬´¬†elsewhere ¬´¬† pile.

Step 5- assess what‚Äôs left after a few weeks 


What happened to me: 

I finally let go of bras that i wore only once because they were not as fitting as i thought when i bought them initially. I saw which pieces were ¬¥orphans‚Äô because they didn‚Äôt fit with anything else. I also saw that I had way too many dresses for the same unique occasion ( Christmas, funerals, etc) and discarded what was in excess.

This method also helped me discover new outfits/ clothe matching.

I began this thing in the end of winter/middle of spring , knowing that by the end of the process I would be left with clothes specifically for summertime. So this process is still ungoing. 

Also also, to speed up the process, I put back in the wardrobe the pieces I knew I had wore recently. 

If you have the space to have an ¬´¬† elsewhere pile¬†¬ª I recommend it!!",declutter,1622808247.0
My most embarrassing declutter!,So like I said I‚Äôve been doing a major cleaning and de cluttering of my house.

Thoughts before buying things in the future: am I going to use it consistently for 10+ years & will it eventually end up in landfill,"As part of our house move we‚Äôve just cleared out our loft.

"Good old emergency declutter... if I don‚Äôt end up moving, my house will be cleaner and better organized than it ever has. Literally ever.","My partner and I live in a <500 sq ft home on a larger property, next door to a business inside a house that is on the same lot, owned by some old friends of my partner. Two weeks ago, we found out the landlord had an offer and was ready to sell the place out from under us, that he was coming by with a buyer inspection in one week.

Commence panic, the place is a wreck and some of these messes are literally months old. 

Fast forward, we‚Äôre not out of the woods yet, but the buyer inspection was canceled due to the business owners in the big house being like, ‚Äúoh hell no‚Äù and making a serious counter offer. If they succeed they will continue to rent us this place until we‚Äôre *actually* ready to move.

In the meantime... I think I have cleaned things in single days that I‚Äôve avoided for months. We‚Äôve packed up a lot of extra stuff for now, took some hard inventory, made a big thrift store box, and threw out a lot of things simply because I hoard shit, but was able to critically think ‚Äúdo I seriously want to pack up and move this broken plastic shoebox/5 y/o comforter/misc crap‚Äù. My partner and I tag team shit, and with less clutter I‚Äôve been able to mop/vacuum places that were way overdue.

Spend time with the things you own. You might discover that they've overstayed their welcome.,"A few weeks ago I had a craving to watch some old movies I've had for ages. I thought, it'll be so great to revisit these old faves! It had been 12+ years since I'd watched most of them. Turns out they didn't age quite so well and I realized I'd probably never want to watch them again after that. And if I did, the library or cheap copies on eBay could make it happen. So into the donation box they went!

The DVD-watching exercise expanded to books, clothes, and other crap I've been neglecting for a long time. Turns out I have been keeping around a lot of things simply because I was used to having them, but when it came time to actually use them, they weren't right for me anymore. 

Basically, I've been fighting against the [endowment effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect) by forcing my things to prove to me that they still deserved to be kept. And it's been so eye-opening! Plenty of things have been neglected because I was never going to use them again. Others are still useful and were just being ignored. (No longer! I am using them again!)

It seems so stupidly simple, but as someone who grew up in a hoarding household and has had decluttering struggles of her own, I've been blown away at how effective the tactic of USING MY STUFF has been compared to just evaluating things by sight. (Or touch, for you KonMari fans.)

Advice for a sentimental anthropomorphiser.,"I know that this sounds weird. I blame Toy Story and The Brave Little Toaster. I‚Äôve always had trouble discarding things into the trash. I am somewhat better at donating but I feel bad for things going into the landfill. I recently got new slippers after having a pair for about two years. I went to throw out the old ones because honestly no one wants slippers like that and it made me horribly sad. I was thinking them saying ‚Äúwait we kept your feet warm for two years please don‚Äôt send us away!‚Äù Or a pair of sleep PJ pants I‚Äôve had for years where the fabric ripped. I‚Äôve mended them because they are so soft. I feel like they‚Äôve served me so well and to dump them in the trash is horribly cruel. I think about how much we‚Äôve been through in the time I‚Äôve had them. 
I know that sounds totally CRAZY but it bothers me a lot to think of the unwanted things headed to the landfill. I‚Äôve tried Marie Kondo‚Äôs thanking them but that almost makes it worse. I‚Äôve also taken pictures but for me the tactile item can‚Äôt be replaced in that way.

Does it make me a bad person,"I just decluttered about 10 years of *things*. It has taken me 4 weeks to completely finish. Most of it was 10 years worth of paperwork that I needed to go through sheet by sheet. Most was schoolwork, notebooks, binders, books etc. 

I had originally planned to donate most of my items, but I've gotten to the point where I'm completely mentally exhausted and do not feel like putting in the effort to even donate the items (like binders and folders, crafts things like brushes, small nick nacks, some electronics like strobe lights, etc) 

I think I'd feel guilty of tossing things that could be donated because of the *waste* factor. But I feel just as guilty wasting this much *time* as well when I could be getting on with my life. 

I am 100% donating my collection of books. But everything else takes time to sort and shove in a trash bag and transport to the donation center. It's so much effort.

I am conflicted and would like your 2 cents (thoughts not money lol)

**TLDR; Does it make me a bad person to just dump it all in a dumpster and not waste another second on my *crap* ?**

Edit: The items in my ""donate"" pile really have no value. There's no clothing and no shoes. It's not large items. It's not furniture. It's not kitchen supplies.

Learning that we‚Äôre just caretakers of stuff,"I have to say thank you & I‚Äôm super proud for a moment, I wanted to share a story. 

My mother isn‚Äôt a true hoarder, but she has sentimentalized many items she owns. About two years ago, she called me to ask if I wanted to keep a shaped cake tin from a birthday party of mine from when I was 5. I am almost 30, and have no children who are 5, so I said no. I begged her to declutter it, give it a new home. But today, she told me she just realized, does she own items she loves for her, or is she just a caretaker of the stuff in her home? With that profound thought, she has begun to give up a lot more items. My siblings and I have strived for years to convince her to get rid of items from our childhood that aren‚Äôt worth saving. And through our encouragement she has let things go. She is making a cross country move in a few years, so it‚Äôs imperative for her to downsize her home, now, so she has less to move then. 

So thank you for the encouragement & tips to keep me motivating her. Since I don‚Äôt live near her, all I can do is give her advice via phones/ facetime. So it‚Äôs been a struggle, but I‚Äôm so glad she told me about her realization today. It‚Äôs going so well!

Decluttering makes more of a mess than having it all in boxes,"I've now decided to get rid of 90% of what I own, because no matter how much I organize and declutter, it just makes a bigger mess. I've already gotten rid of 75% of what I owned over the past 10 years, but the rest is just too much for the small space I'm living in. 

I've ""created"" closets by putting up plastic utility shelves and covering them with curtains, but it looks awful and I still feel like I'm sleeping in a storeroom, which is something I wanted to avoid. I still have a ton of boxes that I haven't gone through, and can't use my LR or DR anymore because of them. For some reason, I was determined to get back into my bedroom, so I moved the boxes into the LR. Now I hate my bedroom because of the ugly ""closets."" 

I don't know what the solution is anymore. I thought I'd make a bookcase wall in the LR to hold all the books, magazines and knick-knacks, but every time I look at that stuff, I want to throw it all away! I've recently donated three boxes of books to a thrift store, but I have several more at the bottom of the stacks of boxes. 

Knick-knacks are hard for me, because I don't really like decorative objects. They were all pretty much given to me by family and friends, so they're sentimental. The ones I bought myself are mostly boxes and cases designed to hold things like cards, collectibles, jewelry, etc. I've gone through all of them, and gotten rid of most of their contents, but I can't let go of the actual boxes! 

My plan for next week is to go through the three large 20 gal. containers of winter clothes and pick out a week's worth of clothes, then donate the rest, plus get rid of all the ones that no longer fit. Why do we always believe we're going to lose weight and fit into them again? I'm giving away 23 sweaters that don't fit me anymore, and besides, I barely ever wear sweaters here in FL.

I'm working on it, but it seems the more I do, the messier it gets. It was much nicer when I had all the boxes neatly stacked in the BR and I was living in the LR. But its done now, so I have to 'RESCUE"" my LR/DR from the mess!",declutter,1624214304.0

Letting go of old stories,"I moved in with my boyfriend a few months ago, and as a devoted declutter/minimalist I brought only my favorite/most essential things with me. Eventually, his eyes were opened to the imbalance in our stuff, especially in the closets/cabinets. He so eagerly accepted my request to help him declutter, and we have spent hours getting rid of clothes, books, kitchen items, etc. What a load off!

But the best transformation thus far has been decluttering his sentimental/childhood items. Discarding  things like tattered baseball gloves, unused bumper stickers to colleges he never even visited, letters from an ex-girlfriend from his teens...it's like I could see the transformation taking place. He's experienced a myriad of trauma from sports injuries, ambivalent relationships, dreams never ""fulfilled"", and he said that letting go of these things was like finally letting go of that little voice that clings to lost dreams and unhappy memories that he as lugged around his whole life. All of these old stories and conflict-filled chapters were put to rest. And now there's even more space in our hearts to bask in and enjoy together.

Just a little success story. I'm so happy for him, and so grateful that he has had an open heart to let these practices change his life and his mindset. :)",declutter,1624811519.0
"You don't have to hold onto entire collections! Or feel the need to ""complete"" the set","So a few months ago I let go of the majority of my hundreds of pokemon cards that I had held onto for 20 odd years. I kept only the few that meant a lot to me (5 cards including my old Charizard) and sold the rest.

BUT that is not why I am here.

I AM GIVING YOU PERMISSION TO GET RID OF THE MAJORITY OF YOUR COLLECTION!

Not just pokemon cards, but whatever you have decided to hoard. For my nerds out there, cards, comics, figures, pops, etc. Whatever it is.... you don't HAVE to collect the entire set/series/whatever. It is OKAY to only keep only the ones that are your favorite, or of your favorite character. You don't need every character from the series/show/etc. 

I have a side hustle of professionally organizing a warehouse for a friend who buys/sells nostalgia driven things of this nature. When you see mountains and mountains of essentially plastic and cardboard... it stops to have meaning. And seeing this much stuff has made me want to declutter my own stuff even more. 

\- That RARE collectible.... isn't that rare... hundreds of thousands exist around the world... we have like 40 charizards in the warehouse right now. shit tons of pops, He-man figures, whatever nerdy shit you can think of... we've got dozens. Lol. Ariel doesn't have shit on us. But seriously, remember at the end of the day, the value the item has... most importantly is the value it has to you. Most of the stuff, even if it goes on E-bay for $10,000 is really not worth more than the plastic it's made out of... since THOUSANDS+ were made. 

\- You are no less nerdy for not having the entire set! It is okay to ONLY have \_\_\_\_ character's comics/figures.. you don't NEED to own EVERY SINGLE DC/MARVEL Comic ever...  You aren't any less of a fan... It is OKAY to only Buy Captain America.. you don't HAVE TO BUY BUCKY too.... or okay to love JUST Batman and the joker... you don't NEED to own every weird arch nemesis he's ever had all the way to calender man JUST BECAUSE there is a figure for it...

\- Spending the money to keep/buy/collect/store all this stuff becomes a burden... so only keep the stuff that sparks joy! The stuff that you really love to see/touch/look at/read. The stuff that brings you that nice dopamine hit every time you glance at it... not just when you get it because ""it completes the collection""

\- Getting rid of stuff you don't use/read/have on display also does not invalidate your love! (Ex. I loved Full Metal Alchemist, but I was never going to read the Manga again... and so I donated it... It doesn't mean I don't love the series... just that that medium wasn't going to be used) 

\- Sell whatever you don't keep! Or free on FB marketplace! Or sell to a store that sells vintage/collectible/toys. Google the closest one in your area, and make a few quick bucks (You won't get full worth, because they need to make a profit... but it will make getting rid of large batches easy and guilt free since the items will get a second life down the road!)

FOR NON-NERDY Items... This still holds!!!

\- YOU DON'T NEED TO BUY THE MATCHING SHEETS/PLATES/CUPS etc for a whole set. You are allowed to just buy 1 and it is OKAY

\- You DON'T NEED THE WHOLE MAKEUP SET, if all you want is the contour (colourpop guily anyone?)

\- YOU DON'T NEED TO have EVERY COLOR of x item.... JUST IN CASE. Just keep the 1-2 colors you like. (Sweaters. nail polish, shoes, whatever).

I hope this helped someone with whatever guilt they might have about collections.

Decluttering your intake process is just as important as getting things out the door,"In the past I've found myself in a regular cycle of frequenting thrift stores, estate sales, etc. as a form of recreation, then donating a few bags back to Goodwill every few months. I didn't buy a TON of stuff, but I'd pick up little things here and there and get really attached to them, and then only donate back about 80% of what I'd bought, leading to a steady creep of items I couldn't really fit anywhere in my apartment.

This year, I've been doing a DEEP declutter, over the course of many months, and also doing some serious work to analyze the process of what comes IN. When I see something I want, I try to envision the full life of the object. Is it going to end up in a future round of decluttering? Is it going to be shifted from room to room and never quite find a home? Just because something is a great find or matches my style doesn't necessarily mean I need to take it home! I do not need a souvenir for every single trip to a thrift store.

We talk a lot about getting things out the door, but the other side of the coin is to not acquire things in the first place.

Success story,"Today my mum, who is very tidy to the point of being obsessed, dropped by to pick up a parcel that had been delivered to my place. She immediately made a beeline to my home office, which I've been working on lately, and she complimented it. 

""It's so organised in here! It looks great!""

Also it took only 10 minutes of straightening up the rest of the flat to make it good enough to have my mum over without me panicking.

Finally Feeling Free of Junk,"We had a leak in our kitchen, and the floors, counter, and cabinets had to be replaced. Literally everything downstairs had to be boxed up and put into storage for weeks until the floors were replaced and the kitchen was repaired/replaced. 

Once the 150+ boxes came back into the house, I started looking *very* critically at everything, and started donating items that don‚Äôt serve enough purpose to merit staying. 

I‚Äôm not even done going through all the kitchen stuff, but I‚Äôve gotten rid of about 8 boxes of stuff and the kitchen is already easier to function in without all that junk in the cabinets! AND it is lovely, too. [New kitchen](https://imgur.com/a/iGfMNIG)",declutter,1625436121.0
[RANT] Feeling the effects of electronic planned obsolescence,"One of the few ""big"" purchases that I've made in my life is buying my first ever iphone in 2015 for ~$900. I got the iphone 6 and absolutely adore it to this day. It still runs perfectly fine. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it.

And yet it is becoming completely unusable in my day-to-day workflow and life.

Apps that I've been using for 6+ years are giving me the ""You need to update this app to continue using it"" error message. When I go to update the app it tells me ""you need iOS 14"", but the iphone 6 only supports iOS 12 and then there is no more support for it. You can't even continue using something as-is because it locks you out. 

It makes me so angry that I am required to give away a perfectly functioning phone because of planned obsolescence. That I have to dish out another $1000 to upgrade from something that isn't broken. I hate it. It makes me feel so incredibly wasteful.",declutter,1625708142.0
Finally following my own decluttering rule!,"When we moved at the end of 2019, I made a rule that we weren‚Äôt going to store any spare kitchen stuff in the basement. Either it fit in the kitchen or it got donated. And I‚Äôve stuck to that rule - anything new had to have a space or something else had to go. It‚Äôs worked out really well. And it helps me to see that, since we‚Äôve moved, I‚Äôve never used a certain pan or tool. I can‚Äôt make the argument that I‚Äôd have used it if it were accessible. 

But I did NOT follow that rule for the rest of the house. My office in particular has several boxes of stuff just sitting in the closet that I don‚Äôt know what to do with. It‚Äôs useful stuff, and I want to keep it, but it can‚Äôt stay where it is, because who wants a closet full of cardboard boxes?! So today I‚Äôm finding spots for it all, and something‚Äôs getting donated or tossed to make room. I‚Äôve just started and it‚Äôs already looking better.",declutter,1625934121.0
Getting wooden hangers really helped my clothing clutter.,"This sounds stupid, but I went to Ikea and purchased a few sets of those natural Bumerang hangers. They're cheap, but they look pretty classy hanging up in the closet. I originally purchased them just for the appearance and to homogenize the look of all my hangers, but I discovered aonther benefit: when I was transferring my clothes to them, they made me think about whether I truly wanted that article of clothing. It was almost like I was asking myself if each article was ""worthy"" of being on such a nice hanger. Especially because I only had so many of these wooden hangers, so they felt more... I guess limited? And I didn't want to waste them on clothes I didn't completely love? Has anyone else experienced something like this? It's so strange, but I'm really glad it happened.",declutter,1626044875.0

"I declutter by reading others‚Äô lists, here‚Äôs my list of 41 things this week (and why)"," I love reading through declutter lists to see if there is anything else I haven‚Äôt thought of and skipped over. It‚Äôs never out of competition, just that I need inspiration and tend to talk myself into keeping things. For this reason, I added small descriptions to show you how I talk with myself about why I‚Äôm keeping something I don‚Äôt love/use. 

Note: I was doing a maintenance sweep, not a full purge. 

This is what I decluttered this week:

1. The covers for my knives because they stay snug in their knife block and I have never used a cover, once. 
2. The extra set of measuring cups/spoons I‚Äôve had since college. I don‚Äôt even bake enough and barely use them, I have others. I only keep these because it‚Äôs a full set
3. The food storage I have that isn‚Äôt glass. I never even use them for leftovers anyway. I kept them thinking I would use them to pack my lunch but the glass ones are easily accessible and organized so I have only used those lately. I never cook enough for leftovers.  
4. A cookbook I‚Äôve never opened but was given to me years ago. The recipes are generic and can be found easily on the internet. 
5. Beer coozies I forgot I had, while I was at it found glass screen protectors for my old phone, old batteries, business cards I can google, and knick-knacks I don‚Äôt even remember (junk drawer gone!)
6. Pens I hate or were free. I have a whole pack of ones that I love, and I would have forced myself to use the one I hate others first
7. The guest towels that aren‚Äôt the right color scheme and because the guests I never have don‚Äôt need 8 towels for their one night stay lol. 
8. A few bags I thought I would use for groceries but everything always fits in my massive blue ikea thing 
9. A totebag that is really nice but I kept it even though I don‚Äôt even like it
10. Handheld graters because I got a stand up triangle one and haven‚Äôt used them since
11. A few fancy dresses that were given to me, aren‚Äôt my style, but I kept in case I ever went to multiple black-tie events?!?! (MINDSET: This is my ‚ÄúFantasy Self‚Äù and someone I will never be. And If for some reason I am, she deserves a brand new black-tie dress)
12. A red belt I have never worn but kept it because of ‚ÄúFantasy Self‚Äù
13. A plant with sentimental value that I needed to let go of
14. More Paper files (MINDSET: If I had to manually scan these in for an electronic storage system, would I even bother?)
15. A free tote from a conference (okay‚Ä¶ a couple. I thought I would use it at work)
16. Some roaster pans I have never used- not even for thanksgiving or anything
17. Some sink faucets I was given that I didn‚Äôt use in my home, and don‚Äôt like enough to put in a future home
18. A few picture frames I haven‚Äôt bothered to hang (over 1 year) and don‚Äôt even really love
19. Some additional jewelry that are for my ‚ÄúFantasy Self‚Äù
20. The baggies and boxes that come with jewelry that I keep in case I need to travel with them, but I have a travel case?!?
21. Fragrances I was given and kept because the bottle looks nice. Smelled them all and they‚Äôre actually pretty awful smelling. 
22. Throw pillows that are always on the couch but are scratchy (p.s. I don‚Äôt even miss them. I thought I would recover them but I want to make things easier for future-self)
23. Plant pots I don‚Äôt like but was keeping for a craft I‚Äôll never do 
24. Unopened carpet cleaner that was leftover from previous owner. We replaced the carpet with other flooring. 
25. Excess Highlighters/ writing utensils I haven‚Äôt used since college 
26. Some winter jackets I have held onto but didn‚Äôt wear the past two winters
27. Nice winter scarves that have a cute pattern but I‚Äôll never wear anything that matches the pattern/colors
28. Sunglasses that make my face shape weird looking (at least I think it does)
29. Shower curtain rings I kept in case mine broke
30. Books I read but would never read again/ use for reference
31. Hair ties I don‚Äôt gravitate to
32. Hair accessories I haven‚Äôt used since college
33. Unopened lotion I won‚Äôt use because of ingredients but was expensive
34. Facemasks for the same reason
35. Clear storage bins holding washcloths on a shelf the washcloths can just sit on?!?
36. Nail polish that‚Äôs off-brand and chips so easily, also duplicates
37. Coffee mugs that are cute but weird to hold/ never get used
38. My second curling iron (It was my back up even though I haven‚Äôt used my first one in ages either)
39. Facewash (I replaced it before finishing it, which left me with a lot of guilt for buying the newer product.)
40. Random notebook I have for random lists around the house. I don‚Äôt like it and I have another I actually use. 
41. A graphic sticky note pad to-do list type thing I use sometimes but it bothers me to write on

Note: I am more of a casual declutter-ing person (declutter small amounts of things as I live my daily life or reorganize a single space). I have never before been one to be in need of a serious purge, but it is always surprising to find things I have held onto for a while, and note how my mindset has changed. What I value has changed as I have grown, so I am working on not being angry with myself for holding onto things I loved/used 4 years ago. I did a declutter when I moved almost two years ago. This is the first time since them I really took time to evaluate what I had and what was causing my space to succumb to a bit of disarray. 

Since this declutter: 

* \- Getting ready in the morning is easier because under my bathroom sink is less stressful to maneuver around.  
* \- I haven‚Äôt noticed the missing ‚ÄúFantasy Self‚Äù clothes/jewelry 
* \- I laid on the couch and looked for a pillow. I grabbed one that was a nice one and therefore never used ‚Äì but it is so soft! And feels so nice! Worth the price for this, not to sit and look pretty. 
* \- It was easier to put my coffee mugs back in the cabinet, and utensils in the drawer after unloading the dishwasher
* \- I didn‚Äôt have to step over the old carpet cleaner heading to my washer/dryer
* \- I appreciated the less crowded plant space on my dining room and actually just looked at my plants for entertainment instead of just to make sure they were watered. 
* \- I was able to free up my junk drawer in my mudroom for my SO to put some things he did need space for
* \- I pulled out my trash can liner without having to move over extra tote bags
* \- My guest closet no longer hold my fantasy self!

I know these things all seem small but the day after, my day was drastically happier! Just about every corner/ cupboard was slightly easier to deal with. 

\*\*\* I am really proud of 35. I have always tried not to clutter my space with things that hold the stuff in my space. I had a three storage bins lined up on a shelf holding washcloths, hand towels and tissue boxes ‚Äì all things that stack nicely on their own. There was no reason for the storage bins. And on top of that, I didn‚Äôt even like the color. 

Please read through and let me know what items of mine inspired you! I am genuinely curious (especially about 11, 14, 19, 22, \*\*\*35\*\*\*, and 41) Share yours because you might help me also ‚Äì I always feel like I‚Äôm missing something I could probably let go of!

"I started a home business right before covid, and it failed. I donated the wares I was supposed to be selling, and it feels so good.","Backstory: In January of 2020 I started a business designing custom fabric. Fast forward, I've been sitting on a mountain of fabric since around October 2020, when I realised WAY TOO LATE that I wasn't cut out for running a business during a pandemic. Before I started the business, I had a love for sewing (and buying new fabric). The old stock was in my sewing area, and had nowhere else that it could fit, and honestly it felt like it was sucking the joy out of my favourite hobby. It was an immense quantity of fabric (so it was like The God Of Clutter), and it was like a lingering reminder of how much pain that business attempt caused. Debt, anxiety (I spent so much time trying to advertise and network that I'm still burned out on most social media), feelings of failure in general. 

What's more, we live in a rented apartment right now, but we're saving up for a house currently and the prospect of that fabric following me to a new home was like a neverending dread. I kept telling myself I needed to figure out something to do with it, but it was such an enormous quantity that it was a task just to think about. I was sure nobody would even want it, anyways.

Well Monday night I got fed up and posted on my local area facebook group, offering it to anyone who wanted a buttload of fabric for free. It... certainly hurt to give this stock that I'd purchased for a LOT of money away for free, but at this point my sanity was more valuable.

50+ comments and two days later, nearly all of it is GONE. And what's not gone is going to a charity that just needs to organise transport. It's gone to a fashion student who now has enough matching fabric to make a whole clothing line. It's gone to someone's mother in law who just really likes sewing. It's gone to a bunch of different craft groups, charities, and hobbyists. It's GONE.

I feel so free. I can actually continue my decluttering journey now, because the behemoth lumbering around in my loft is gone. And what was causing me so much distress is now sparking joy for a TON of other people. 

So yeah, bit of a weird kind of declutter, but I felt it belonged here because this subreddit really pushed me to want to see it gone. And also, it's such an amazing feeling I had to share.  


(Side note because it's fun if unrelated: because of the debt I am/was in from the business, I had to brush up majorly on my other employable skills to get us out of it... and now I'm in a job that I love that pays money I never could have dreamed of. I'm getting out of debt caused by my business failing BECAUSE that business failed, in a sense. Which is also one of the reasons I gave the fabric away for free. Life's weird as shit.)",declutter,1626275836.0

Decluttering = spreading happiness to others,"In the past few days, I‚Äôve used the Craigslist free section to get rid of a few things. Having not really used Craigslist before, I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect, but it was SUCH a positive experience. 

‚Ä¢ TV/DVD player: Both were rarely used, 10+ years old, but in working condition. The guy who picked them up said he was going to give them to a friend in need.

‚Ä¢ 30+ metal rods from an IKEA bed: had been sitting in my closet for years. The guy who picked them up said they were just perfect for plant stakes, and he couldn‚Äôt wait to get them in his backyard. 

‚Ä¢ Camera: almost just ‚Äúorganized‚Äù this into an electronics bin‚Ä¶ but realized I hadn‚Äôt used it in 10 years. The woman who picked it up was SO grateful and said she needed it for a project. She gave me a hug!

So many‚Ä¶.bowls,"Two weeks ago I started throwing out 10 things a day. I do major decluttering a few times a year, but 10 things a day is something I can do every day, and I like decluttering. 
The fact that you have to ‚Äòsearch‚Äô for 10 things makes you look in those hidden corners, the drawers you never look in. 

Last week I was looking in the kitchen and I saw bowls in many different places. So I thought I would count them. How many bowls do we need ‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs just the two of us. And we don‚Äôt have visitors a lot. On a regular basis just my mom or our daughters. 

Now bowls are something that we like to buy. Sometimes because we need to (the holiday accommodation had only very tiny bowls and we like to have breakfast in larger bowls so we bought two larger bowls in the thrift store. (This, three times. Same with mugs. üò¨) Sometimes because we see a bowl we LOVE. 

Anyway. I started counting and I quit counting at 52‚Ä¶. üò± and that was not all. 
I was in shock LOL. I am not a hoarder,  and everything is nicely put away in the cupboards ‚Ä¶ how was it even possible we had 52 bowls? 

So we donated some to the thrift store. 

Today I am looking for another 10 things to declutter, and looked in a box in the garage. Guess what I found there? 16 more bowls.

Staying in hotels to escape the clutter at home,"I feel so overwhelmed by the sheer volume of stuff I still have, despite giving away and throwing out easily 100 plus bags.

I'm so miserable living like this and still feeling like I've barely scratched the surface. I stay in hotels just to feel like I can actually relax and its worth every penny. I know I could probably put that money into the house but I'm just so stressed out by it that I can't even think straight or plan what steps I'm going to take so I just end up doing random bits and getting distracted.

Habitat wouldn‚Äôt take my furniture donation,"We‚Äôre moving & I‚Äôm getting rid of stuff while packing. Initially, we were going to hire a mover that would also pack, but the cost is insane & our time table moved up to where we can‚Äôt get a mover now without paying even more. The mover we were going to use also encouraged me to NOT get rid of stuff. 

I took a load over for donation of my craft room furniture and they wouldn‚Äôt take it! I felt really bad cuz the stuff (imo) was ‚Äúnice enough‚Äù & I felt/thought to myself ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt take my crap when I‚Äôve seen what the s**t you sell here looks like?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt say that to them, but I thought it!

I had a total break-down ugly crying session when I got home. I realized I‚Äôve been asking myself if I‚Äôm worthy of something instead of asking if it‚Äôs worthy of me when bringing it into the house.

So I took a load over to the dump & it felt really freeing & good. I‚Äôve gotten 2 other loads donated this week. I listed the dining table for sale, I‚Äôve got more stuff piled up for donation & I‚Äôve got another load in mind for the dump. 

The next time you find yourself feeling ‚Äúbad‚Äù about your stuff, ask yourself if the stuff is worthy of YOU instead of asking if you‚Äôre worthy of it (or even believing you‚Äôre not). This goes in line with my buying for the idea of who I want to be or thought I could be if I owned something as opposed to who I really am now. Asking that item‚Äôs worth in relation to me has helped flip the script on why I keep hold of things that are actually dragging me down & helping to lower my self-esteem cuz of the clutter or low-quality of the item.

Dear car dealers: I don‚Äôt want a ‚Äúfree‚Äù t-shirt with your logo,"Two years ago, I bought a used minivan. After I signed the paperwork and got the keys, the salesman said, ""OK last thing: let's get your T-shirts!"" No joke, they had a whole bunch of shelves with T-shirts, silkscreened with the car dealer's logo, in every imaginable size.

I politely declined, and the salesman gave me that fake ""You hurt my feelings"" look which perturbed me. I mean, I had just barely spent thousands of dollars on a minivan, and now you're offended that I won't be a walking billboard for you??? Seriously, I'm happy to buy things that I actually need, like a minivan that won't lose power when the temperature exceeds 100¬∞ F, but don't expect me to provide free advertising for you.

Don't try to guilt me into storing clothes that I honestly will never wear. I have enough stuff, and I'm trying to reduce what I have. Don't make things worse.

(And for those of you who say, ""Just accept the shirt and donate it,"" I have some bad news for you. Nobody who shops at Goodwill will buy a silkscreened shirt with a car dealer's logo on it.  So this T-shirt will end up recycled/trashed.)

"My ""nice"" clothes sold for a total of... ¬£13!!","After posting here about clothes I still wear despite not feeling 100% comfortable in them, I went through my wardrobe and got rid of most things that despite being in perfect condition just aren't my cup of tea. A lot of them went straight to a donation bin, but to satisfy that voice in my head that keeps telling me that these things have monetary value and I'm losing out by not selling, I attempted to sell 10 of the ""nicest"" items.

I grouped them into two bundles - the ""silk"" bundle with five 100% silk items, many by french and italian brands, and the ""linen"" bundle with five items from brands like ralph lauren and esprit. None exactly designer but they were my personal thrift treasures.

After photographing each item with their care labels and any imperfections, creating the listings, writing descriptions etc - each bundle ended up selling for a whopping ¬£6.50, which I set as the starting bid. I now still have to find packaging, package them, write the labels, and take them to a post office. After that I'll have to update the buyers that the items have been dispatched, and then worry about the postal services losing the items or buyers not being happy and opening a case with me.

Declutter your sock bin and turn your old and mismatched socks into dog toys!,"I love this sub and constantly get lots of great tips and inspiration from people‚Äôs posts on here, so I wanted to pay it forward with a stroke of inspiration I had this morning while decluttering my sock bin. 


It was super easy and all you need is old socks and a pair of scissors (and, I suppose, a dog üòâ). I braided together trios of crew length or thigh high socks, and cut up a few ankle socks into strips to tie both ends together. I had two leftover long socks, so I just tied several knots throughout the length of them. My dog loves them, I didn‚Äôt spend a dime, and now he has half a dozen new toys! 

I live by myself, but I was thinking this might make a fun activity for parents to do with their kids! I used socks, but I think it could work just as well with old rags or towels, or even clothing like T-shirts. Plus, I feel happy knowing that I‚Äôm extending the life of the sock fabric a while longer before it ends up in the trash, while cutting down on some of my clothing clutter. :) 

Hopefully this link works, here are some pictures of the toys I made and the playtime that resulted immediately following. I‚Äôm not a crafty person by any means so I‚Äôm sure someone with more skill could make them look much prettier, but Calvin still gives them 10/10 approval. 

Happy decluttering!

"Mindset shift from the book, ""Decluttering at the speed of Life""!","I'm so happy someone shared ""Decluttering at the Speed of Life""  by Dana K. White on here. What a game-changer! 

The biggest take-away has been refining my understanding of a container. A container isn't just a cute jar you put pens in, or the boxes you use to keep your socks separate from your underwear in the drawer. The drawer is a container. A shelf is a container. A closet is a container. Your house is a container of containers.

When you start decluttering, she has you start from the most visible places from the entrance. She uses 2 boxes: garbage and donate. (No keep box!!!! What?! I'll explain later.)

1. Throw away all the obvious garbage.
2. Then as you go about decluttering, she doesn't have you take everything off the shelf or out of the closet. She just has you look through the area for anything out of place.
3. When you find an out of place item, you ask yourself two questions: 

* Where would I look for this item if I needed it? And then you just go put it there. Yes, even if you have to walk all the way across the house. You can do a quick scan and see if anything else needs to go to that place to save a trip. When you get to that place, if that container (shelf, closet, box) is already full, then you have to do one-in-one-out. What can you donate or throw away to make room for this new item?
* The second question is ""If I needed this item, would I even know I already had one?"" If not, toss it.

At first glance it seems wildy inefficient to take out of place items to their final place right in the middle of things. But it means that if you get distracted or interrupted, things are ALREADY BETTER and you're already at a stopping place. It means that you have a box of garbage (easy, just throw away), a box to donate (easy, just take away), and that the area you were decluttering has fewer things in it. 

It may not be done, but it is better. You left things better. And when you have another 5 or 15 or 55 minutes, you can leave things a little bit better. No more ""keep"" boxes to sort through. You haven't created MORE clutter. 

The other thing I love is the question: Where would I look for this if I needed it? Somehow it just simplifies things. Not ""where could I store this""? But ""where do I look for this when I need it""? 

And then the container concept! No more worrying about whether or not the item sparks joy, or has value, or if I might need it someday. Just a simple ""Does it fit where it belongs?""

Because at the end of the day, we can't just get more containers or shelves. Because our houses have a finite amount of space in them. But it's hard to remember that when we know we can just go get another container from the Container Store. The problem is that our house is already full. There isn't room for more containers!

So to solve the headache of deciding whether or not a thing has value or will be needed or sparks joy, we just ask, ""Does it fit here, in the place I would look for it if I needed it?""

And if it doesn't, then you have to decide which item you can get rid of to make room for it. That's a little easier for me. 

And the best part is that as you go along, you're making visible progress, which gives you more energy and motivation! Just wanted to share how awesome this mindset shift has been for me. Highly recommend the Audiobook. Makes great decluttering listening!",declutter,1629221413.0
"After not living in my apartment for 8 months, decluttering feels far easier","Last January I had to drop from school for the rest of the semester because of health issues, and my school apartment sat empty for the rest of the winter all the way to the next autumn. During this time, me and my partner had discovered a mutual dream: Moving into an RV. Which means that everything that isn't necessary *has to go*.

 I had been trying to slowly and gradually reduce the amount of stuff in my life earlier - I had made it a rule of thumb that every time I move to a new place, I'd have at least one box of stuff less than I did last time. But now that we're planning to fit the whole life and material property of *two* people into one vehicle, just one box less isn't going to do.

 Having needed *nothing* from here for six months gave me a lot of much welcome clarity on how little of my property I actually used. Why do I have three large cabinets full of stuff that I haven't used in half a year? Why do I own *two* white tablecloths when I don't own *a table*?

 Before this, my decluttering has been mainly stuff that's *completely* useless, just junk, which is easy to let go of. Now I'll need to start with stuff that's still *useful*, but not useful *to me*.

I've been at work of filling up a box to take to the flea market all day. Still most of the stuff I find from my cabinets is literally just trash - things too broken to fix, ""important papers"" that were never important at all, broken art tools and dried-up and expired things - but the flea market box is slowly filling up as well, things that I do not use but someone else could have a better use for.

 For years I've looked at this stuff and thought ""meh, I'll go through them eventually, one day"". And 'one day' is today.

The ' burden ' of owning stuff,Last week I was with my friends and we went shopping. Which was the first time in for ever because COVID. The two for them bought clothing ( like one of them bought over 10+ items at different second hand stores) and I was like no thanks I'm not even looking at stuff for myself I'm not buying clothes because that only means that at some point I have to declutter it. Which they seem to think was depressing.  But I really see it like that. I own so much stuff I feel like I'm spending more time decluttering and tidying than actually enjoying my stuff. At this time I rather not buy clothing or just buy something that's absolutely perfect because it's easier not to buy stuff than decided what to keep and what to donate. Or  I just buy candles and beauty stuff at this point because then you use it up enjoy it and it's not there anymore which is easier..üòÖ because I really feel like it's a burden that I own a lot of stuff.. anyone else feels the same ?,declutter,1629740859.0
"Gave away a bunch of stuff for free on Craigslist...but instead of starving the landfill, I feel like I'm just feeding the hoarders (and resellers)","Most people are chill & polite & only express interest in a few items from my craigslist posts...but every so often, the proud new owner of my trash will roll up in a vehicle *filled to the headliner* with assorted junk. Which my junk then joins. If their car looks like that, I shudder to consider the condition of their house. 


This very afternoon, I walked away from an older gentleman in a chonker of an SUV, wondering if anyone is ever going to cook in my cast iron grill pans ever again...or if they'll just end up in a roll away dumpster after that man dies, and his kids chuck all his accumulated trash en mass. His vehicle looked like it had hit up every curb alert from Richmond to Baltimore. 


I have a separate post for clothes, and I regularly receive emails offering to 'take all of it'--even though the styles are wildly different. I just don't believe there are multiple size 0 women out there coveting my...denim punk-lite mini skirt from high school *and* practical work khakis *and* sparkly sequined bandeau top *and* a load of mismatched plastic hangers. 

Someone's selling this shit--which I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with, so long as they actually wore & used whatever doesn't sell...which, let's be honest, is gonna be most of it. Instead they'll make a dollar or two off the best pieces & trash the rest--which is exactly what I'm trying to avoid. Landfill waste. 


Anyways thanks for coming to my TED rant. May your clutter find a forever home somewhere...just, you know, not my place üññ

**ETA**: I'm getting a lot of judgmental comments (mostly from salty resellers) along the lines of 'wElL yOu BoUghT iT nEw soUltimatelyYouCreatedTheProblem sO StOp BuYiNg sHiT'

Yeah that's not what's happening here--a lot of it is stuff former roommates simply abandoned when they moved out (thanks Allison for dumping a 15 lb bag of senior dog food on me...I don't have a dog ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø).

Other pieces are 'gifts with purchase'. I buy most of my clothing 2nd hand, and I've noticed poshmark sellers in particular like to include little knick knacks. This is stuff I did not ask for & do not want--that's how the sparkly tube top landed in my closet. I suspect it was 'gifted' to me because the seller couldn't find a buyer. This is why I'm not particularly interested in passing off more clothes into the cycle of reselling--I'd rather just give it to someone who actually wears sequined crop tops.

Others are things that made sense in a past life--the cast iron grill pans? Made beautiful meals on the gas range in my old apartment. But I can't use them on a glasstop stove üòî. Same story with the khakis--used to be part of my office dress code, but I don't work that job anymore. The new job is less khakis & more Carhartt. 

My issue with resellers isn't profit or effort--it's wastage & the ecological impact of the Great Global Garbage Stream.

**I agree that resellers are providing a valuable service when the original owner simply wants to dump stuff en mass, dump the mental load & forget about it--but I already did the most labor intensive part: cleaning, prepping, measuring, snapping pics, drafting & posting an ad. This is not a service that makes sense for my stuff. The reseller is not adding any marginal benefit.**

I don't care if they make money off it; but the fact of the matter is, most 2nd hand clothes don't sell for a profit. The seller is eventually going to trash unsold inventory, and I think there's an even greater business incentive to trash inventory that cost them nothing to begin with. 

A lot of resellers are chiming in to explain that they donate unsold merchandise, but that's just [trashing with extra steps.](https://www.greenamerica.org/unraveling-fashion-industry/what-really-happens-unwanted-clothes)

"I made enough money from decluttering, that it is paying for my cross-country move","I am in a long distance relationship and am closing the gap this week.  He lives near my dad, and my dad is sick with stage 4 cancer, and it made sense to finally come home after spending 4 years in another state.

So I decided to declutter.  We announced my move to family on Mother's Day 2021 I was coming back, with the intent of moving in October.  The move has now changed to early September because of my dad's health.  So here I am, all packed and ready for the U-Haul.

I've given 12 carfulls of stuff to the local donation center, trunk and backseat fully loaded.  That was the easiest way to offload a lot of my stuff without guilt.

Trashbagging it wasn't my favorite option but I think I probably tossed about 2 industrial sized garbage bags worth of things beyond repair or worth.

I like to flip items on Mercari, which started as a stress hobby when I was furloughed during the early stages of the pandemic April 2020.  I was stressing about paying for my move (U-Haul, hotels, gas), but figured I could do Mercari again and see what would happen.

And I did it.  I made a goal to sell enough to equal what the cost of my U-Haul + tow dolly would be, which was $887.00.  On July 20th I met my sales goal and transfered $954.40 out of my Mercari account.

And I kept going.  About doubling my sale goal, earning a total of $1808.35 before the move.  I just put my shop on pause today, so I can pack up my laptop and printer.  I just packed the remaining to sell items and was able to fit them in a small box.  

Keep pushing hard with decluttering.  For me, it was worth selling my decluttered items.  I'm sure more will come up when I unpack, but I did the best I could before my move and I'm very happy.",declutter,1630875022.0
Radical idea for inherited fine china,"I inherited an 8 piece setting of fine Noritake china from my mother in mint condition that she received as a gift from my uncle. The packing slip is still in it.  She never used it and I am not so sure it's been out of the box (other than when I opened the box myself), but here's the ideal that I'm starting to live instead of just saying it in my head.  *That china was made to be enjoyed*, and not to sit in a musty box in my basement.  I've been complaining for years that my everyday dishes are chipped, old, cracked, mismatched, etc.  I am in the process of moving/decluttering because we're moving to a house half the size, and I was thinking about how much money I could get for that china. Brand new, it probably cost the equivalent of a couple thousand, and I could probably still get about $400, but it's beautiful and it's such a shame that it still sits in a box with the packing slip from 1969, so it's coming with me to the new house and I am going to start using it.  

A set of new Corelle would probably cost me as much for all the pieces I have (including serving dishes).  As for the old dishes, the ones that are still in good shape will either be donated to my son and his fiancee (if they want them), or else to the local thrift shop that supports the local homeless shelter - the chipped ones will be used for target practice.  I consider it an absolute victory that I am going to use those dishes for dishes instead of letting them sit somewhere and be admired from afar.  Someone may be rolling in their grave that I'm going to put them in the dishwasher, which will probably wash all the metallic trim off, but oh well.",declutter,1631120464.0
Just decluttered my engineering college notes: letting go of my past self,"I have an engineering degree but got my first job in warehouse management after graduation. It‚Äôs been 7 years since I finished uni, I have moved company, got promotion etc, all in the warehouse management and planning. Realistically I‚Äôm happy with my job; the hours are good, the money and benefit is pretty good, work life balance is there, I get along with my boss and colleagues. 

However I was having a hard time letting go of my physics, chemistry, and advanced math lecture notes and exercise books. 

After weeks of self analysis, I‚Äôve concluded it‚Äôs difficult for me because:
1. I feel like I am ‚Äòwasting‚Äô my degree by not working in engineering field, even though I had a blast at uni and without the degree I wouldn‚Äôt have got my first job (they picked me because of my degree since they needed someone with a decent computer skill and a fresh college graduate seemed pretty savvy)
2. I feel like I might need these notes if someday I get a more technical job. Realistically, I‚Äôd have to compete with all graduate engineers to get an engineering job and start at a lesser pay. Without getting a master degree, It‚Äôll be difficult for me to get a senior engineering job to match my current salary and I‚Äôm not thinking of getting a master degree anytime soon, not in the next 2-3 years.
3. I was a good student. I went to a very academic and highly prestigious high school and university. I took pride in my good marks. Letting go of these notes seemed like losing an identity as ‚Äòthe smart one‚Äô to me.

This morning, I threw them in the recycling bin. I flicked through them once more, to be honest I don‚Äôt really remember how to solve these equations anymore. I literally kissed each exercise book, thanked them, and threw them in the recycling bin while saying out loud ‚Äòget recycled now, will you‚Äô.

It‚Äôs so freeing. I feel a bit sad but at the same time i feel light and happy.
I have the space for them, my house is not cluttered as I‚Äôve embraced minimalism for a couple of years now.
However, those notes and notebooks, stacked neatly, didn‚Äôt bring me joy. To me, they were nagging me because I don‚Äôt use them anymore and I‚Äôve forgotten how to do all these intricate and complicated calculations that I was once so proud to be able to solve. 

I am free of them now, free of expectations to be ‚Äòsmart‚Äô in an engineering way.
I like my non-engineering job, it‚Äôs time to move on, and my graduation testamur/certificate that I display on my bookcase is enough reminder that I did it, that I had a great time at college.
The past doesn‚Äôt identify me now, I‚Äôve let go of that identity; of being the smart college student, and am ready to embrace who I am now, a young warehouse manager who is darn good at her job.

Epiphany about the ‚Äúsilent to-do list‚Äù,"So, a lot of people have heard that every item in our home contributes to our ‚Äúsilent to-do list‚Äù- ‚Äú *oh, I need to clean this, return that, finish that project* ‚Äú. We also know that statistically, women are more likely to have a lower clutter tolerance than men, experiencing more anxiety when spaces are cluttered than most of our male counterparts. It literally just dawned on me, as I tidied up before bed, that a large part of why women generally have a lower tolerance for clutter is because we‚Äôre more likely to be the ones having to deal with the silent to-do list. If someone is doing almost all of the household chores, of course clutter and excess is going to bother them more, because they‚Äôre the one that has to actually deal with it.

The author explains how they did some studies about a weird phenomenon they noticed in themselves and others: if they decided *once* early on that something was too nice to use for an occasion, they were even more likely to decide against using it again and again. Things that were not inherently special or valuable took on a specialness that prevented them from ever being enjoyed (e.g. an ordinary bottle of wine started to feel like a wedding toast wine, a Target shirt became viewed as an extra special blouse, etc). 

Eventually some things would get used for an extraordinary occasion, but often enough, they would go unused until they had gone bad, gone out of style, and so on. This ""specialness spiral"" then ends up being a big cause of clutter accumulation.

I'm specifically thinking of old, ratty clothes, cheap kitchen gadgets, and opened toiletries. No one wants them and we end up having to PAY OUT OF POCKET to get them taken away. It ends up COSTING us.

The condition of the majority of the clothes we got was horrendous! If it's pilling and the fabric is worn thin, do not donate it. We got leggings with holes in the crotch and tops with armpit stains. It has gotten much worse in recent years as the ""declutter"" trend has grown.

I know people are trying their best, and that can opener still works, but it's garbage and it ends up in a landfill anyway. Why?

Please understand that we didn't resell what we received, we simply processed them before they went to an organization that provided for those suffering from addiction.

But please remember that many of the people donating leggings with holes in the crotch also thought they were ""decent.""

This is a big issue we face. it's especially bad before the holiday season. It clogs up the system.

And for those donating useful items, the people who get them are truly grateful. A few years, we collected used dresses and gowns right before prom so that girls from less fortunate families could go to prom. We also provided baby items to teenage moms, and that was received very well.

In fact they try to convince me not to declutter my things, saying one day I‚Äôm going to need it all and I‚Äôm going to regret getting rid of it (I.e. an old scarf I never wear, when I have 5 newer ones already). **edit: yes, I donate my old clothing and other items if in good condition. Parents still hate me doing so. I purchased the clothes with my own money** 

How do you deal with a family that doesn‚Äôt want you to declutter your own stuff? They are like hoarders, never wanting to let things go even if they‚Äôre old and dirty.

**Edit: thanks everyone for the advice! to clarify, I already do donate most things that I can** such as clothing and home items in good condition. And yes, my parents still hate me donating things or trashing things regardless. Its the act of be getting rid of things that bothers them. In this specific example of the pens, I just didn‚Äôt think old junky freebie pens were worth donating.",declutter,1636842434.0
"Throwing things away is really hard, particularly if you fancy yourself to be a friend of the environment.","BUT SOMETIMES it is okay to just throw it in the trash if it creates problems for you selling, donating or recycling it. If it becomes a ""beast of burden"" by ""doing the right thing"" and not getting it out of the house, it is okay, and empowering to just take the easy way out. You will be fine. 

Don¬¥t try to do everything so perfect that it stops the prosess and stuff is still in your house.

Paid off my student loans today,"This subreddit helped change my perspective. It got me to take a long, hard look at where my paychecks were going and that what I was buying was just clutter.

Used my Thanksgiving visit to my parents to purge 90% of my childhood memorabilia.,"Bless my mom's heart, she saved so much of my childhood drawings, report cards, school pictures, toys....but I have been paring down this year and finally have my own house so I have room to take my memory boxes home.

I threw out 6 bags of trash/recycling (LOTS of paper) and a box of donate. Finally got everything down to ONE Rubbermaid bin (and two tiny boxes of photos and cards).

Most useful tip I found: go through and purge, then circle back and go through again. Once I had seen the whole spread of, say, middle school drawings, I could better gage which I truly wanted to keep.

Tell me your stories of decluttering memorabilia or high nostalgia stuff! Because man, it's tough but satisfying.",declutter,1638111615.0
"Instead of donating everything, I sold all my clutter and made ~$2k","Hey all, I've always had a habit of accumulating a bit of clutter everywhere I settle down. After I moved into my current house and throughout Covid I realized the happiest times in my life were when I could throw everything in a few suitcases and take off. I had some hobbies I needed to be realistic about (sewing/cosplay) and that I was never going to finish all the projects, so I decided to take charge of my space and really clear as much as I can out.   


It also really hurt me to just 'let go' of some of these things I had spent a bit of money on or I had truly loved, but no longer really served me. I kept hearing that donation centers are really overwhelmed and most things won't be used either way. So I wanted to try and get rid of my stuff but also get it into the hands of someone else who would truly use it. It's been about a year since I started this project and I found a lot of resources that helped me get rid of my clutter while also recouping a little money and ensuring the things were being used and I wanted to share some of what I learned!! (And also how much money I made in each category)  


**Books** \- Super easy, low time investment \~$25  
I love Discover Books, its an online used bookstore-type site and when shopping for some gifts I noticed they have a Buyback Program. I gathered up all the books I was looking to rehome and entered all the ISBN's on their site. If they want the book they'll give you an estimate, send you the postage to ship them the books, and all you have to do it box them up and ship it out. I was able to send them quite a few for about $25 and donated the remaining ones!  


**Home Goods/Hobby Stuff/Furniture**, Low-ish time sink, $823  
I found Facebook marketplace works really well for home stuff, I listed larger items/things that generally required pickup and most things would be gone within a few days. I sold cat trees, desks, chairs, dog toys, picture frames, game consoles, a projector and more. This might be a little bit of a sneaky tactic but when I wasn't really sure the value of an item I would list it on FB Marketplace and then on OfferUp but I would make the price on one listing a little higher. Since items moved so fast I would occasionally get an offer on each and just took the higher one.  


**Knick Knacks/Collectibles/Small Electronics**, Medium-Big time sink, \~$1k  
I had a BUNCH of knick knacks and collectibles from trips to Japan and my younger years where I wanted to have figures of EVERYTHING. A lot of these things were still in their packaging!! I just couldn't let them go knowing I had paid for all these blind boxes but they literally sat in a drawer, forgotten for months at a time. I found eBay was the best spot for these items and especially smaller electronics and I even got WAY over asking on some things (listed a Nintendo DS for $100 and received a $350 offer within a few minutes). This was a bit of a decent time-sink in terms of taking photos, listing, replying to questions, shipping, etc. but I did re-home a ton of items and made a decent chunk of change for them!  
Things I sold there: anime magazines, artbooks, anime figures/keychains/toys, old macbook, old digital camera, Nintendo DS, Pokemon cards, old DSLR

&#x200B;

**Clothes**,  big time investment, \~$400-ish?  
Oof this one is a bit of a mess and I still have stuff hanging up in a spare closet waiting to sell but here's what's roughly worked for me??  


Depop/Poshmark - Trendy brands/clothes  
I found that the only things really worth listing on Depop for someone like me are brands that are currently trendy. I found stuff like Adidas, Champion, I.am.Gia, etc. all sell super quickly. And more niche brands go even faster like Omocat. Sometimes I'd sell 3-4 things in a day and then weeks will go by with nothing. But to recoup the cost on some of these things really took the sting out of it.

ThredUp - Mall brands, unbranded clothes  
For mall branded clothes or styles that may not be trendy right now, I found its more worth it to send over to ThredUp in a massive bag rather than hoping I'll offload it on Depop. I had pretty good success with ThredUp and usually all my items would sell, the payouts from ThredUp are pretty meh but even getting $1 back on a pair of leggings I never wear made me feel a bit better. I made about $200 from ThredUp over the last year, anything they don't take from you they will donate.  


Unhoused Shelters/Donate - Bulky clothing items, sneakers, jackets  
I had a few old jackets, puffers and sneakers that I felt would be a pain to try and sell online when someone told me that homeless/unhoused shelters would really appreciate. I separated some of the super bulky items I had like jackets and sneakers and took them over to the shelter drop-off. I wanted to do this last year but with Covid they weren't accepting items at the time. Obv. no money made but I felt these items would be best served donating them here than just dropping them at Goodwill!  


I hope this post is useful to some of you, I feel really inspired reading everyone's posts on this sub and wishing you all luck on your decluttering journey :) <3",declutter,1638228915.0
I. Am. Down. To. ONE. Christmas. Tote!,"I just went through and decluttered all the holiday decorations that I just don't use anymore.  Tossed the broken stuff and donated the good-but-not-our-style-anymore things.  I am down to a single tote of ornaments and the box that the tree gets stored in.  

It's so weird to think about having so few decorations since I remember pulling out boxes upon boxes of decorations as a kid and even in college, I had probably 10 totes of decorations (I worked at a craft store so employee discount on top of clearance prices meant I overbought for a few years).  

Even the tree skirt got donated.  The cat would use it as a slip and slide and it was almost 20 years old and just not my style anymore.  I mentioned to my mom that I'm going to wrap a piece of cardboard with wrapping paper to make a tree collar that's less tempting for the cat (who generally leaves things alone except that tree skirt) and recycle it in January and she tried to convince me to keep it and store it while simultaneously complaining that her tree collar was so big and bulky and took up an entire shelf in her basement.    


While I have the storage room in a state of chaos from pulling holiday decor out, it's time to go through things again.  The last time I decluttered, I got rid of a few things but ended up with 2/3 full totes.  This time I'm going to condense and consolidate.  My goal this month is to have everything fit on the shelves with nothing on the floor in front of them.  It's a lofty goal but I think I can make great progress if I can get the rest of the family on board.  This storage room has been the bane of my existence since we moved to this house.  It's always a multi day event to get decorations down and I want to be able to walk in, grab what I need and walk out instead of dismantling the entire room.",declutter,1638393396.0

Start with your kitchen table. Keep it completely empty.,"If you don't know where to start, or if you started decluttering and feeling stuck, empty your kitchen table or dining table. Tables are the largest horizontal surfaces in a house and they tend to collect all kinds of clutter.

 Remove everything, and try to find a home for them. Your goal must be ""nothing lives on my table"". No fruit ball, no napkins, no salt and pepper, no vases. It's remarkable how a clean surface is so soothing to look at.

 It's the same principle as the made bed. Makes the rest of the room look clean too. Eventually you will leave stuff on the table mugs, papers etc, but since nothing lives on the table it will be as easy to put away as is to leave them there.

Getting rid of stuff via my Buy Nothing Group has been so freeing,"For the longest time I've held on to things that I though we're too expensive or nice to just ""give away"" aka send to the thrift store.

This week I said fuck it and posted a bunch of stuff in my local Buy Nothing Group and have given nearly all of it away to people who are actually going to use it! No more guilt about things rotting away at the thrift store either. I'm a happy gal!

Edit: I love all of the love that Buy Nothing groups are getting here! If you've never heard of it, it started through the Buy Nothing Project. They have an app now, but in generally most folks are more active in the community Facebook groups. In these groups it's a complete gifting economy.

"Tackled the freezer, a job I've been putting off for more than a year","My freezer wasn't actually bad, I threw out less than 5 lbs of expired food, but it was mostly almost-empty bags of frozen veggies/fruit. That made it look like it was overflowing, but it was just how we shoved things back when we finished cooking. It's actually not-even half at capacity, which lets me know I'm not overbuying food and I'm eating what I am buying.

The worst part of it was chipping away ice that had formed in the tray and shop vacuuming ice chunks out of there. 

Since my freezer is just two giant drawers, I used some left over drawer organizers to split one huge drawer into three small sections and got it nice and organized. Need to invest in some little container boxes to finish splitting up the deeper bottom drawer of the freezer, which is  75% empty. 

Best part - I found a whole unopened sleeve of Thin Mints in the bottom of the freezer, so I know what I will be snacking on tonight as a reward. I also am using the remains of ten separate almost empty bags of frozen veggies for some stir fry for dinner. 

This is a success and a huge weight off of me today.",declutter,1639784586.0
Looking for perspectives: how to make peace with the money I‚Äôve wasted on stuff?,"The main reason why I fail at decluttering is remembering how much money I spent on some stuff (mostly clothes) that I‚Äôve never used and can‚Äôt imagine myself ever using at this point. The amount is just too much to simply donate/give away the stuff. 

I‚Äôm luckily not in debt, but to think ~10% of my net worth is tied up in stuff and won‚Äôt yield any returns is discouraging at times.

Would love to hear your perspectives/advice. Thanks all.

Update: thanks everyone who chimed in, and the kind stranger for my first award. I loved hearing all of your thoughts, and especially the Konmari way of thinking about how my things have fulfilled their purposes. Going to read the book, donate some and consign some!",declutter,1640026441.0
Stealth Decluttering - how did you do it?,"I live with semi hoarder parents who discourage me from decluttering my own possessions. A couple people recommended stealth decluttering and oh, it‚Äôs been a bit of an exciting challenge. 

Every day I load up my work backpack with stuff to get rid of (think junky items, cardboard boxes, old clothes etc). 

On my walks to work I stop by and gradually empty out my junk at various trash bins and make a stop at a donation bin too. And at work I put my cardboard in recycling.

Gifts to Future You,"What favors are you doing for Future You as you get and stay organized and tidy?

Mine include:

* Making sure the spot where I unload groceries is bare before going shopping.
* Setting out the fixings of my preferred drink before I go out for errands (especially if it's a big-box store or a walk in the snow), so I have a reward (and less temptation to stop for cocoa on the way home).
* If an item going into its ready-to-be-used spot (not pantry storage) doesn't need to be sealed for perishability, opening it when I put it there. This includes opening jar lids as the jars go into the refrigerator and  unsealing the new plastic wrap box as it goes into the drawer.

My grandmother passed suddenly and I have inherited her very full home ‚Äî everything feels sentimental and I don‚Äôt know where to start.,"My grandmother passed unexpectedly a few months ago. 

She was the matriarch of our family and very meaningful for me. 

Unfortunately towards the end her cognitive functioning was starting to go and the house went with it. She amassed many random items, her useful and sentimental items became totally disorganized, and general housekeeping went by the wayside. 

By the time we realized, it was not long before she was admitted to the hospital, and then we were too distracted to bother with the house of course. 

Anyways, she has very generously left the house to me. Even after everyone has come through and taken the things they‚Äôd like to keep, it is still absolutely packed. 

As in ‚Äî there is barely space on the counter to cook dinner. 

But none of it is ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù it‚Äôs mostly items like cake pans and yarn and paintings she‚Äôd started and never finished. Things of that nature where I‚Äôm guessing she either bought multiples not realizing, or started new projects not remembering about the old ones. 

I‚Äôm the only family member in this area of town so have to tackle this mostly on my own. It‚Äôs driving me absolutely insane, quite literally, to live in such chaos (and not have room for my own things which are still in boxes in storage), but not nearly as difficult as it is to part with her things. 

Any advice would be really appreciated. Especially about making slow, steady, sustainable progress as ‚Äútoday‚Äôs the day I conquer this‚Äù methods have definitely crashed and burned for me.

The more stuff you have the more you have to worry about,"Was just moving apartments the other day and it blew my mind just how much useless junk I had. Items you use once and never touch again and others only for incredibly specific things. Tons of old clothes I never wear but take up valuable space, making a mess of everything. Not to mention you have all this stuff to worry about incase anything happens.

I realized it was all pointless. I don't need any of this junk and I never did. Will old articles of clothes and excessive furniture give me any benefit in the next life? All it does is make me worry and quite honestly clutter up my mind. Not to mention finding things becomes a nightmare.

I don't want to do this anymore. I'm donating all the clothes I don't need or use. All those old multivitamins that probably didn't do anything to begin with.

"My ""dollar a day"" rule of thumb for getting rid of unwanted gifts","I notice this time of year that a lot of people seem unsure what to do with gifts they received that they don't want or can't use. It feels rude to get rid of them too soon, but burdensome to keep them too long. I thought it might be helpful to share my rule of thumb:

Look up or estimate the dollar value of any gift you don't want, and keep it one day for each dollar it cost the giver. Put it out on display where you can see or use it daily, and each time you do, take that as an opportunity to reflect on the person who gave it to you. Once the prescribed time is up, sell or donate it without guilt.

So a $5 greeting card can sit on the mantle for 5 days, a $25 shirt can get hung up on the closet doorknob for 25 days, and so on. I find the inconvenience to me is minor and temporary, and it honors the gift giver enough that their money wasn't wasted in a way that shoving it in a closet or keeping and resenting it indefinitely doesn't.",declutter,1640623050.0

Who is your ‚ÄòFantasy Self‚Äô?,"I thought it would be fun to detail our fantasy selves for all to see - and maybe how far away we are from those...

For those that don‚Äôt know, there is lots on YouTube but the fantasy self is the concept of who you ‚Äòwant‚Äô to be - which is typically achieved by buying or accumulating stuff - but you rarely use - and if you‚Äôre honest, this isn‚Äôt you - an example could be you buy loads of bath bombs, essential oils, soaps, candles because you‚Äôre the type of person who has long luxurious baths and relaxes for hours on end - when in reality you‚Äôre a stressed mom of three who hasn‚Äôt taken a bath longer than 15 mins in the last three years.

My fantasy self is a rugged dad - he‚Äôs a real go getter - he‚Äôs active and he goes the park - he takes his two kids on adventures - he also journals and eats well, goes gym, is in shape. He wears kinda south western Ralph Lauren plaid, denim boots, but more out there stuff like waistcoats and bandanas (like a rugged Johnny Depp).

He enjoys ‚Äúcinema‚Äù he buys DVDs and blu rays of films he really wants to watch and appreciate. He spends his free time reading books and watching films. He has a large collection of great movies and music.

He‚Äôs organised. He carries tools in his car, which is always clean inside and out. Always ready to help out - he even has winter tyres. Can you believe it.

The 5 item game (a.k.a How I tackle clutter with ADHD),"I'm a Very Messy Person ‚Ñ¢. My desks accumulate millions of things and it gets so incredibly overwhelming that I can't handle it. So I came up with a system that works surprisingly well. 

**Figure out your areas** 

In a bedroom, this might be your nightstand, your dresser, the chair in the corner, one half of the floor, and the other half of the floor. That's 5 regions. 

**Put 5 things away from one of the areas**

This is where the magic happens. You don't need to stress or beat yourself up. Just pick up the 5 easiest things to put away. The only rule is that they have to be put where they belong. You can count 3 pens as one item, or 3 items. Count them as you pick them up. No more and no less than 5 (or any other number you choose. Even 1 is fine. Just stick with it once you start). Don't worry about any other area until you're done. 

**Move to the next area and repeat** 

A piece of paper, a pencil, a cup, a lip balm, and a rubber band. Boom. Done. Move on to the next area 

**Cycle through the areas until there's nothing else to put away** 

**Why I think this works (for me, at least)** 

It's SUPER low pressure. Sometimes I count a toothpick as one item, sometimes I count a set of pencils. But somehow, it helps so much. As you cycle through, you'll probably notice things that will be easy to grab during the next round. 

It's also very rewarding to have these reasonable goals. You can make it a game. Set a timer for 15 minutes and see how many rounds you can do. Or set a goal for a number of rounds. I just do rounds until I'm bored. No matter what, you'll have a tidier space at the end. 

**Hope this helped you**

This is is the only thing that consistently works for me, so maybe it will help someone else. Also, if you have additional ideas, please share!

Edit: This is for items that have been taken out, and just not put away, so everything ideally has a place to go back to. 

I mostly use this in my art studio, so 95% of items have homes.

If something doesn't have a home, I will instead put 4 things away, and find a new home for the 5th thing.",declutter,1641164957.0
Expectations vs. reality of inherited books I thought would be treasured by original owners,"When my grandma died several years ago, I inherited some of my mom's childhood books. My mom had me in her 40s and is 74 now.  

There's a hardback chapter book from my mom's childhood in the 1950s that a) is out of print, b) the titular character of the book has my mom's name and even looks like her, c) as a kid, my mom had neatly written her name in the book multiple times, as if quite proud of it. Surely this was a book of treasured significance; getting rid of it would be sacrilege. 

I sent my mom a photo of the book and her cursive inside it. Her response, essentially: ""Oh, that? Struggling to remember it... you should sell it if it's worth anything.""

Similarly, a few years ago I asked my dad (70) if I could take one of his books from his house. I recently got around to reading it. This was essentially our convo: ""Dad, I finished *Papillon*, it's a good book."" ""Yeah, a great book. I really liked it. Where'd you pick it up?"" ""Um.. it's your book. I got it from your house?"" ""I vaguely remember."" (note: my dad is still working and doesn't have memory issues)

Again, that's it. No mystical significance to the item itself; I could've read any copy of it. But if either parent had died before I'd got around to asking about it, I'd have imbued the items they were indifferent to with all sorts of needless meaning. 

Moral of the story: if you're holding on to inherited items out of a sense of guilt or obligation, keep in mind the original owner might not have actually cared much either, nor want you to preserve their stuff like you're a museum or something",declutter,1641185913.0
I don't know who needs to read this today but it is OK to throw that out!!,"For too long I've hung on to things that I don't like because I thought it might grow on me, or I felt guilty for spending the money, or I thought maybe someone could use it, or I intended to list it on marketplace but never got around to it, or I did list it on marketplace and no one wanted it. You know the deal.

I had this body spray that I absolutely HATED from the moment I bought it. Every time I used it I was grossed out. But I kept using it anyway, convincing myself maybe it wasn't so bad. Finally one day I said you know what, INTO THE GARBAGE FOR YOU. And it was so freeing!

As we head into a new year, consider this your permission to just throw it out. Yes recycling, reusing, and giving away is ideal but you can't suffer with stuff you don't need holding out for the perfect moment to let it go. Let it go right now. Into the trash. Take that shirt you hate that the thrift store doesn't want anyway, cut it up, use it to wipe off your toilet and THROW IT AWAY.

Moving forward, be more thoughtful with your purchases. Ask yourself ""do I really need this?' But for the love of all that's holy, give yourself permission to throw things away every now and then. Decluttering is not about following a perfect template toward liberation from stuff, it's about letting go and giving yourself the lovely, liveable space you deserve. Toss it!

Well in the past two days I have washed the dishes (they were stacked up for almost a year because our oven broke and I didn't see a reason to clean our oven pans), almost totally (except what I used for dinner last night) and cleaned out our laundry room/bathroom of all the clothes that got ruined from our ac pouring water into our old room without us knowing and creating a lot of mold. I'm hoping tomorrow I can clean our old room and begin to make it into a storage room/ space for me to put my sewing machine so I can actually sew. Then I hope to finish the small things I have left to do and I can just do small upkeeping things, like dishes and laundry and deep cleaning once a week. I'm very excited! Hope everyone is doing good today!!",declutter,1642019861.0
Just a friendly tip for unwanted jewelry‚Ä¶,"There‚Äôs a US based organization called ‚ÄúI Have Wings‚Äù which takes costume jewelry and other kinds of jewelry (even mismatched pieces or one earring) and provides them for crafts for the elderly among other things. They accept mail in donations but you must pay for the shipping. I sent a USPS Flat Rate Envelope last night full of jewelry I was no longer going to wear for ~$8.00. I know paying money to donate seems counterintuitive but it seems so much less wasteful for someone like me who has a hard time just throwing things away. 

Hope this information helps!",declutter,1642347360.0
your complete guide to go from overwhelmed to semi minimalism,"I recently posted this on the minimalism Reddit but got a comment saying it would be better suited here! I hope this helps someone 

Your complete guide to go from overwhelmed to semi minimalism

yes I used to be a maximalist. I got my first apartment, along with a well enough paying job & went crazy with the decor. 

I got in this mindset that I needed this or that in order to have a cool apartment and the more cool decorations the better. 

and honestly everything went well together, and it looked decent, but then I never stopped. 

It was never hoarding level but I just had a lot of stuff,

I could never keep my apartment clean. It was really sad because I have a nice apartment, and i wanted to have people over but I never could because my apartment wasn‚Äôt clean.

Nothing had a home and I was just constantly trying to reorganize to make everything fit, 

To clean a bathroom counter it took me like half a hour because of picking up all the products and moving them

I felt so overwhelmed and I didn‚Äôt like how my apartment looked

I started having to designate every weekend to cleaning, which I then would just reorganize, make a bigger mess & have to repeat the next week

I also kind of had a shopping addiction, like it was fun, and something to do not to the point where i was in any kind of financial stress, just accumulated a bunch of stuff

Finally I broke, I had enough of working all week and cleaning all weekend, I kept researching how people kept up cleaning and I couldn‚Äôt find anything, 

Finally I decided to work towards minimalism, not insane minimalism but decluttering minimalism 

Here are some things that changed my life:

I went through every single thing, every single drawer, every single cabinet

I got some moving boxes from walmart which helped and I had a goal to fill up 5 large moving boxes with just stuff

I posted anything worth over $20 value on Facebook market place, kept the boxes for two weeks and then gave the rest to goodwill

Here are things I went through

bathroom area: 

I took all the products out and put them on my vanity 

anything I didn‚Äôt want, don‚Äôt like, it doesn‚Äôt work for your skin, the scents old, the packaging looks gross, there‚Äôs only a 1% chance the situation you‚Äôd use it in would actually happen, it‚Äôs easy and cheap to repurchase etc was given away

I checked duplicated and got rid of duplicates I didn‚Äôt see myself getting through in the next 2 years 

Then the kicker - I picked 3 drawers, hair supplies, makeup, and other and whatever I could fit I kept, 

(That was only about 30% of my vanity space used :)

same with shower stuff, anything I can‚Äôt fit on the shelves or don‚Äôt like I gave away to my little sister 

I ended up giving my sister literally 40 pounds of products 

kitchen -

I aimed for absolute bare counters 

I ended up with only a blender and a soap dispenser (: 

I went through every food and condensed it down to 1 cabinet, 

if it wasn‚Äôt the noodle style I liked, if I did not like it, if it was too unhealthy, if I had duplicate spices, or didn‚Äôt like the spice, if it‚Äôs too hard to prepare, if I haven‚Äôt opened it and have no intention of opening it I gave it to my boyfriend

I went through cups and bowls and if they weren‚Äôt easy to clean and microwave safe I gave them away, same with pans

If I don‚Äôt like the cup because it‚Äôs ugly or a bad texture I gave it away, 

I got rid of duplicate utensils I barely use like  can openers or apple cutters, shredders and anything that was ugly, had rust on it, etc 

the dollar tree has most kitchen utensils even some pans! So anything I didn‚Äôt see myself using I got rid of 

Cleaning products i condensed if I had multiple bottles and gave away the ones I didn‚Äôt like, and am still whittling down today, the most important thing is knowing what you have and moving towards multi cleaners 

living room

went through my cords, any obscure duplicates that I rarely use I got rid of, any broken cords or cords that don‚Äôt work half the time I trashed 

the rest I bundled up and put in separate see through organza bags, 

Medicine was easy, I put all the bandaids in one container, got rid of obscure rarely used duplicates, got rid of expired medication, got rid of anything I don‚Äôt use that could be found at the dollar store 

For board games, movies, party supplies, anything that can‚Äôt fit inside a drawer had to go

Desk area -

For my paperwork I got this accordion organizing file thing and separated by subject, took pictures of things I might but likely will never need and shredded the rest


I decided through out this process I would use the last of the barely left candles so that took care of that

I got rid of any pens that didn‚Äôt work or that I don‚Äôt like, I got an organizer and any pen pencil marker that wouldn‚Äôt fit got trashed 

For books I allowed myself to keep 10, I rarely read as I enjoy audio books, I sold the rest on Facebook marketplace as bulk books 

Bedroom - 

My bedroom was mostly cluttered with furniture and decoration, I sold a few furniture pieces 

I took everything out of my room except for my bed and my desk then I only put back things I seen myself using rather than just trying to fit them in 

I got rid of picture frames expect for my favorite 3 and hung the pictures on the fridge instead 

Closet- 

I got an over the door shoe  organizer and any that don‚Äôt fit I gave away

I only kept plain ankle socks that were black and fuzzy socks I have the match for 

Only kept comfy bras 

Got rid of clothes that don‚Äôt fit, or are hard to wear, or don‚Äôt flatter me

I changed my wardrobe to only specific colors because I was tired of only having one shirt that matched a given pair of pants

I stuck to gold jewelry and got rid of any silver or tarnished jewelry 

anything I wore, all jewelry I wore, it all matched. I didn‚Äôt have to think much about what I wore, it all just went, some things go better with others but I didn‚Äôt have to search for the one shirt that matches the one pants, since everything flattered me I had to change less 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I‚Äôm well aware that I‚Äôm not a complete minimalist, I don‚Äôt only have 100 items, and Not everything I have is white.. but minimalism changed my life, 

I barely spend anytime cleaning because I don‚Äôt have many surface things, and what I do have has homes

Maximalism is great for some but it wasn‚Äôt great for me, it just got so overwhelming and I didn‚Äôt know what to do, I couldn‚Äôt keep my apartment clean, and I was constantly unsatisfied with my place, it sucked so much time from me 

You need to view stuff as disposable, that unfinished lotion that you hate the smell of is disposable, those tarnished earrings are disposable, that candle that‚Äôs out is disposable

don‚Äôt worry about getting rid of cheap and accessible things, if you can get it at the dollar store, and you never think you‚Äôll use it get rid of it 

gifts- it‚Äôs hard to not accumulate things when you get so many physical gifts, If they‚Äôre really meant for me and I like it I keep it, but if it‚Äôs something I barely like and is a gift just because they have to give you a gift I try to regift, 

I leave in the package and put a sticky note from who I got it from, things like candles, perfumes, Mugs etc are great for it 

I only regift if I think they will genuinely enjoy it, & I never regift to anyone associated with who I got it from! 

I keep them in a drawer and it‚Äôs also a great stash in case you forget to get a gift for someone !

Things are meant to provide you value, not take away value from your life, 

Think about the item upkeep, get rid of things that aren‚Äôt worth the upkeep - certain pants that collect dog hair, plants that you can never seem to keep alive, lamps that you always have to change the bulb, lights where you always have to change the batteries, cups that aren‚Äôt dishwasher safe, shag rugs that are impossible to clean, shoes that always get dirty,  

I hope this helps someone else!

I just lost 100 pounds!,"I'm an admitted hoarder of paper, so I resolved to unhoard this month. We had a 2-drawer filing cabinet that was so full, closing it was a chore, in addition to a small file box on a top shelf of our laundry room that none of us had opened in a decade at least. 
 
One file folder at a time, everything came out, including taxes back to 1986, medical files dating back to 1995, manuals for everything we've purchased for 30 years, and the warranty for our computer we bought in 2001. *facepalm*
 
At least 2,000 papers were shredded, and the rest went to recycling. Easily 100 pounds of paper gone, and the filing cabinet is gone too!
 
All that's left now easily fits in the small file box, with room to spare. I feel lighter and motivated to start on the next decluttering project!",declutter,1642615102.0
"Browse the ""wanted"" section","This may be obvious but it never occurred to me that I should also check out the ""wanted"" sections of freecycle/olio.

There's a lot of items which I don't even bother putting up ads for and feel like if I put them on the street in a ""free"" box they'd go untouched. I am talking old magazines with pages cut out for an arts project kind of thing.

Well last night I ventured into the ""wanted"" ads and who would've known it people want all sorts of things. I got rid of an old chipped mirror, a box full of packaging from an IKEA order (which I was holding on till recycling day), partially used up jar of loose leaf tea that we didn't like from a zero-waste store, and a half-dead plant that I was going to chuck into compost.

I just agreed time for pick up and put said items on the curb with a sign ""For Jane from Olio, pick up \~9:30pm"" and that was it. I live on a quiet street with no foot traffic, so this saved me lugging a ""free"" box to the main road.

As an added bonus there were zero no-shows, as I guess if people wanted these items so much they made an ad for them, they were more committed to actually show up.

Don¬¥t sabotage yourself when it is difficult to sell/ donate/recycle in the most sustainable way.,"We humans attach our selves to lots of stuff - even if we don¬¥t think we do. When we find discarding difficult we sometimes find ways to sabotage our self - both  unconsciously and consciously. 

We all want to do the right thing and let our stuff be taken care of by someone else or becoming useful again. But, sometimes there are to many bumps in the road that make it difficult to discard and we end up unhappy looking at our stuff that get stuck, while wanting a decluttered home.

Trying to resell my clothes has surprisingly helped me avoid recluttering my closet,"Someone mentioned earlier how decluttering is an *ongoing process.* You do it once, and then you do it again and again. 

My biggest area of focus in declutterring is my closet. I stopped being ‚Äúclothes blind‚Äù in 2020, and really tried to actively participate in my closet. I noticed all the clothes I never wore, and clothes I loved but didn‚Äôt wear, and even clothes I *just added* but hadn‚Äôt touched, as well as my obvious rotation. 

Taking out the ‚Äúnever wears‚Äù was easy. It was the ones I loved but didn‚Äôt wear or the ones I recently added that were difficult to remove. To me, they still had value, so I couldn‚Äôt just ‚Äúget rid of them.‚Äù 

So, I tried listing them online to resell. 

And what I learned, is that it takes *a LOT of work* to go through the process. 

At first, I listed everything. Forever 21, H&M, items I got for $20 or less, reselling for around $8 or so. I thought they were a good deal. Clothes were in good enough shape. 

But nope, *nobody wanted them.* So they just sat. 

Eventually, I sold a few that were $9-12. And my return? Under $5. It was a waste of effort. 

I did have clothes that were more expensive, and I was amazed at how quickly they moved. It was surprising to see how buyers preferred getting the Lulu‚Äôs dress for $40 vs the forever 21 dress for $20. 

So, I reevaluated my shop. I removed anything that wasn‚Äôt going to give me a return ‚Äî post fees ‚Äî of at least $20. Man, did this fuel my declutter! I went from having a store of 100 items to just under 30. 

I learned a LOT by going through this exercise. 

For starters, realistically, nobody wants your junk. You got a new shirt for $8 and it‚Äôs still in good condition? Great, your ROI was fulfilled. YOU got to use it. You‚Äôre not going to get your full dollar back by reselling it, and whatever discounted rate you give it really isn‚Äôt worth the income you receive. Your time is worth more. 

Next, I learned that it‚Äôs better to have a shop of a few items than to overstock. Again, this is a hobby shop. It‚Äôs not my FTJ. I‚Äôm not trying to maintain stock, I‚Äôm trying to get some small ROI to feel better about the dollars I spent in the first place. So for me, it‚Äôs better to have a small shop that conveys *quality* than to list everything and cheapen my brand. (Lol, I don‚Äôt actually have a brand.)

Having this set baseline helped me get rid of *everything* that didn‚Äôt meet it. No longer was I hanging on to the forever 21 romper to resell for $18. It was going straight to donations. My stock was no longer taking up multiple bins in my closet. I felt free. 

This in turn, also meant that for the clothes I *was* reselling, I put *a lot more care* in the staging, description, and overall quality of their listings. 

Finally, and most surprisingly, I‚Äôve become more conscientious of the items I *do* add to my closet. I have become more at peace that if I buy a cheap basic long sleeve shirt from H&M, whatever I use it for will be my only ROI. I won‚Äôt seek reselling it. It gave me what I wanted for the time I had it. But of course, I do enjoy having clothes that have resell value. And, those clothes are more expensive. What‚Äôs been surprisingly nice is my new-found slow approach to adding items to my closet. It‚Äôs more expensive for me now, so it takes more time in between purchased. 

I feel I have become more aware of my closet, inside and out. I have comfortably filled all the functional gaps in my closet, so I‚Äôm less motivated to buy things on a whim. The items I buy now are of much higher quality, and purchased more slowly. And I feel better not hanging onto something for its potential value. It either has value or it doesn‚Äôt. And it‚Äôs okay to let it go when you realize it doesn‚Äôt have the value to you thought it did. 

TLDR: most of your clothes don‚Äôt have the resell value you think they do. Accept the time you got to enjoy them as the full extent of their value, and then let them go.",declutter,1643473598.0
Got rid of two years of trash today!,"Long story/short, depression, lost job 2020.

Reminder: ‚ÄúCollecting‚Äù may be Shopping Addiction,"Oftentimes, people validate their shopping addictions by calling themselves ‚Äúcollectors.‚Äù This gives it legitimacy by making it into a hobby, disguising the true nature of the action. It is an addiction to purchasing a specific type of thing. More problematically, calling yourself a ‚Äúbag collector‚Äù, ‚Äúshoe collector‚Äù, ‚Äúmakeup collector‚Äù, ‚Äú18th century coin collector‚Äù, ‚Äúrare stone collector‚Äù, ‚Äúpen collector,‚Äù etc. ties it to the identity and makes it harder to get rid of.

For context, last year I developed a hobby of getting really into perfume. I would read about each perfume, learn the notes, learn about the house it came from. I would even read books about scent. I also purchased and received a lot of perfumes as gifts. However, despite wanting a ‚Äúiconic scent‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt use them up to completion, and would seek the next purchase, despite having lovely perfumes already in my collection. People identified me as a perfume hobbyist/collector. Since reflecting on my relationship with perfume, I now use up each perfume and have developed low-consumption hobbies (drawing, painting, running, lifting weights, organizing my apartment).

Ask yourself: do you really enjoy and use up each item you get, or do you spend more time scoping out the next one? Take your time to enjoy and use each item to completion before purchasing a new one. And finally, try to structure your hobby around actions, not purchases.",declutter,1643642275.0
Different relationship to stuff than previous generations,"Does anyone else find themselves completely unable to relate to previous generations' patterns of hanging on to things?

Reevaluating my relationship with material goods and consumerism,"I‚Äôve been on my decluttering journey for a month now and I‚Äôm trying to sell my stuff online. It makes me feel good that my stuff are getting a new life even if it only sells for $5 (and honestly, the $5 adds up)

But selling is time and effort intensive. I look at similar items being sold online (for price checks) and I realize there are SO MANY people all trying to sell their stuff. And yet, as a society we always feel like we need to buy more stuff from retail stores. 

It was kind of an eye opener for me. We are conditioned to always want more more more, way beyond what is essential for a quality life. Our society is overflowing with stuff.

Here is what I learned: 
Rule one, don‚Äôt buy stuff unless if you‚Äôre sure you‚Äôre going to like it and use it for the long haul. No more mindless shopping, everything I buy must have a clear purpose. 

Rule two, try to shop on second hand market first before buying new things from retail stores. There are just so many items out there.",declutter,1644932382.0
"When companies are not making lasting products anymore, is buying for life even possible today?","The titanic brands and manufacturers are onto us. They don't make many lasting products anymore. Why sell you one thing that lasts five years when you can engineer it to fail in two? That literally more than doubles their profits! It‚Äôs getting more and more difficult to find those products.

 I think the foremost thing we as conscious individuals can do is pick items that are repairable over disposable. We can‚Äôt do everything the earth needs, but the earth needs everything we can do. Think carefully. There are no consumer magazines to accurately tell you what will last a lifetime. Here are some beliefs: Buy simple. Fewer moving parts in a product helps. Lifetime durability implies lifetime maintenance. Take care of what you buy. Minimize use. Buy strong products. Thicker chair legs may break less often than those that are graceful, but weaker. Buy products whose technology you are familiar enough with to be able to repair. Be gentle. Most items last longer with light usage.

Also, while a buy for life purchase often involves the trade-off of spending more upfront, price does not always indicate quality, and it doesn't always indicate the kind of quality that brings durability.

My family is making me feel guilty over the stuff that I got rid of.,"I have had a real problem of letting go of things my whole life.  For some reason, I am a very nostalgic person, even though I haven't had a very good life.  I would hold onto things that reminded me of the good moments.  I always fear that nothing good will ever happen to me again, and I need to hold onto those moments for dear life because they're all I have.  Because of this mindset, I never let myself get rid of anything.  I still had clothing from 25+ years ago when I was a kid.  I had more stuffed animals than I knew what to do with.  Barbies that were missing body parts, even their heads.  I just couldn't throw away anything.  I would even keep the boxes that they were shipped in.  It had gotten to a point where I no longer had room for anything new.  If I bought new clothing, I would have to put it in piles on the floor because the draws were filled.  Then, the piles on the floor started growing.

Back in December, I watched a video, and the person said that if an item has been put away, and you don't even think about it anymore, than it must not be that important.  That really spoke to me, and I started watching more videos about decluttering.  I started slowing throwing things away.  I felt bad about it at first, but then it started to feel really good freeing up space, and seeing the piles on the floor going down.  Anything that was still in good condition, (other than clothing) I donated.  It made me feel better knowing that those items weren't just sitting in a landfill somewhere.  After awhile, I had gotten rid of nearly all of the junk.  There are still things that I just can't part with.  They mean too much, but I got rid of easily 85%+ of the clutter.

I was feeling really good about this, but now my mom and my brother are making me feel terrible about it.  They keep telling me that I got rid of my whole childhood, and I'll never be able to get it back.  They are really upset with me.  I keep telling them that I didn't get rid of a single thing that truly meant anything to me.  That it was just junk, but they don't see it that way.  I already have a real problem with anxiety, and I feel guilty, and regret everything else in life, so now they've made me regret this.  I had a major anxiety attack last Sunday night over it.

Did I go overboard with the decluttering?

Inherited clutter revelation,"I just came to a realization. I have donated a couple dozen bags of stuff since January, but the sticking point has been inherited things.

Over the past years, family members have moved and downsized. And more stuff than I ever needed or wanted has been passed onto me. 

We all like antiques and vintage, and there have also been plenty of things passed from previous generations, who also appreciated those types of things. Most of it falls into that category. Not exactly true family heirlooms (and I will hold onto the truly meaningful heirlooms), but more like, ""your grandmother was into milkglass, teacups, and dolls -- here are those collections which I fondly remember growing up with!""

I've taken a lot of it, because I know it would be painful, for example, to tell my mom (painful to her) that I don't want something that is meaningful to her but that I don't have special memories of, don't really like, or don't have a use for. Sometimes I've been told, ""This is valuable, if you don't have a use for it, you can sell it!""

So I have a garage full of bins of stuff that ""I can sell"" or use in a theoretical house that I will own someday. But it's a lot of work to sell things, I'm done with having garage sales, and shipping breakable things makes me nervous. And I probably will never have a place, or desire, to display most of those things.

Of course, some of it I do love. And I'll keep those. 

But I just had a realization: 
The amount of money I could get for those things doesn't compare to my time, and the amount of stress that they cause me now. (And they are causing me a lot of stress, and have done for years.)

And whatever pleasure they bring (truthfully, not a lot) doesn't compare to to the pleasure of just owning things that I really love. And it doesn't compare to how great it will feel to have more usable closets -- or a garage I don't have to walk through sideways and can park a car in again. 

With that realization, I can donate these things now and feel okay about it. I don't have to feel guilty about not selling. People who appreciate them will find them (much like how my grandmother or mom collected them) and the proceeds will benefit local charities. And I get space -- physical and mental -- back. 

I can release these things. I feel lighter just thinking about it.",declutter,1645832609.0
Pro tip: decluttering is easy when a flood takes all of your belongings,"We lost almost all of our possessions in the ongoing brisbane flood. I have been decluttering and it sure was easier to get some important things out without unwanted junk everywhere.  I am also trying to keep in mind some of the decluttering themes, like of you dont remeber you had it then it doesnt matter, gifts are to be recieved then they have served there purpose etc. 
Anyway, wherever you are, stay safe.",declutter,1646217387.0
"Finally decluttered my packed-full closet, and had an emotional moment of self-acceptance and self-love in the process.","I usually lurk on this sub, but today I finally got past my biggest stressor in terms of clutter- a closet we use as a catch-all storage area. I've been decluttering other areas of our house slowly over a long time, and seen a lot of progress, but this closet has ALWAYS been looming in the background. When I would picture ""finishing"" decluttering, this closet is what I would picture as the final step, because it always seemed too big to tackle ""right now,"" so I could only ever picture doing it ""later.""  Recently, I've been thinking a lot about this closet. Every time I have felt stressed about our clutter, this closet came to mind. Over the past few weeks, every other declutter effort I made felt meaningless in light of this closet. It had come to represent my personal struggles with clutter. It felt like the one area that would NEVER get clean. Today, I set out with the intention of 1) figuring out what was even in the closet, and sorting appropriately, 2) categorizing the sorted remains into tubs, and 3) finally decluttering the notebooks and old school books I had in there. 

Number 3 was a big step for me, I've decluttered many areas over the years and have never been able to let go of these old notebooks. I hold immense sentimental attachment to old school notes, in the same way some people hold immense sentimental attachment to old diaries or artwork.  I have ADHD, and had a lot of stress and shame around academics, particularly as a teenager. I would, as a high-schooler, get fed-up with feeling stupid, check out textbooks from the university library nearby, and hyper-focus on taking notes. Over and over and over. Every notebook I had represented my efforts to work past my own ""laziness"" and general feelings of ineptitude. Every moment of shame around school, and every moment of pride as I tried to work harder and harder to overcome it, was wrapped up in this unwieldy collection of notes. I graduated almost 8 years ago, and it took until now to be able to let go of those things. I tossed EVERY old book of notes into a trash bag (to be sorted into recycling shortly), as well as many other items I could never see myself parting with. An old report of my ACT scores here, an old certificate from my high-school debate team, there. This has been my biggest moment of sentimental letting-go, of releasing myself from the image I've always held of who I could be, and of accepting who I am as I move forward. It was a moment of self-love that has taken years of journaling, therapy, and growth to get to. And it all culminated with ridding myself of this clutter. It has left me feeling raw, but happy and proud. 

To my surprise, all of the remaining items fit neatly into categories, there was no need to put anything in a ""miscellaneous"" bin to be decluttered or sorted later. I labeled each remaining tub - one for Christmas decorations, two for unused office supplies, and one for table-top games so we can entertain company, and so-on. It went from a jumbled mess of who-knows-what to a labeled, accessible, organized closet. I can find our wrapping paper, blank thank-you notes, social security cards, checkbooks, and whatever else I need from in there. I have a whole pile of old boxes to break down, and all-in-all, about 3 garbage bags of trash/recycling. One closet may not seem like a lot, but it was everything I couldn't imagine even getting through, and today I conquered it, and I am so proud of myself.",declutter,1646277606.0
"The other day I asked my husband ""If our house burned down, what valued things would you be secretly relieved to be rid of?"" We had a great conversation!","We didn't make specific plans to act on the conversation- just kept it confessional, which I think was the right move- it kept us feeling free to be honest, without fear that the other would hold us to what we'd said.

It was interesting to realize how much unconscious bias I bring to decluttering. I struggle to get rid of clothes, old paperwork, unused kitchen tools, and the like, but some things don't even seem to enter the mental realm of possibility.

It was really good to just admit to each other that we'd like to be free from so much that we own. It was also super illuminating to hear his picks and name my own. Neither of us said ""Outdated clothes!""- even though clothes are bulky and personal and hard to get rid of, it turns out they're still pretty low-hanging fruit.

Then we asked each other what few items we'd save- we pretty much said important documents and irreplaceable musical instruments. Other than that- we feather our nest as lovingly as anyone, but it's interesting to think that it's all just stuff in the end.",declutter,1646349289.0

New Decluttering Goal/Epiphany,"I started this decluttering journey in December of 2020. Had a few periods of backsliding, but it was more of an irritation at having to catch back up than any real damage done. Most of the time I'm maintaining and chipping away at little areas that need to be done.

But yesterday I had the thought of why not view my little house like an AirBnB? I stayed in a few when relocating, and loved how they were prettily decorated, clean, and fully stocked when I moved in.

One was especially great. The woman who owned it would come with a maid every other week, clean, tidy up, change the bedding (including ironing the sheets!), make the bed look beautiful and inviting, and leave an arrangement of fresh flowers for me to enjoy. It was so lovely to come back to.

So what if I act simultaneously as AirBnB owner, always looking with an eye to everything being as peaceful, beautiful, uncluttered, clean as I can make it for my guest, with me being the guest? Like I'm living my life on a relaxing holiday, but this AirBnB also just happens to have everything I own that I most love and need, without having to pack or unpack!

The down side is I also have to act as my own maid, but I do that anyway, and when I'm thinking in terms of ""How can I make this really nice for The Guest?"" cleaning doesn't seem so much like a drudgery, I'm taking my time and enjoying doing it for The Guest, lol.

Parts are already good to go, but other parts I'd change if I were renting this out, so I will change them. It'll be a process, but so far I'm having fun doing it!

I draw the line at ironing sheets. Spritzing with linen spray and smoothing them with my hands is as far as I'm willing to go, and it does make them lovely to slip into.

So my new decluttering goal is to make my place AirBnB ready. On a permanent basis (within reason).",declutter,1646694056.0
A Lesson in Keeping ‚ÄúUseful‚Äù Things,"I‚Äôm the person who struggles to get rid of things that I think are perfectly good or that could be used for something. I have boxes and boxes full of random things that I can‚Äôt bear to part with because I‚Äôm convinced I‚Äôll need them again.

Preparing for the worst,"Recently I have been really worried about a fire in my apartment. I get this way every couple of years but this year I decided to do something about it.

Yesterday that all changed. I went through everything and got rid of most of it. My important documents are now in a plain binder in plastic sheets so I can easily see everything I need from mine and my wife‚Äôs government documents, to the the love notes we have written each other, to the proof of purchase on our cars, even the pets health records. All of it is in one spot so all I have to do is grab it and get out. I‚Äôm feeling so excited and chilled out now about emergencies.

My mom is an aspiring hoarder that works at Dollar Tree,"Hello all. I just wanted some advice to declutter my space. I haven‚Äôt lived with my mom for 5+ years but she‚Äôs still nearby and in my life. To compensate for being a sh*tty parent she gives me gifts. Too. Many. And it‚Äôs not ones with any meaning or value, it‚Äôs stuff from her work (dollar tree, obvi) that she finds would be helpful to me somehow. Christmas is the worst, because she‚Äôll fill my ‚Äústocking‚Äù with loads of things from dollar tree that she finds instead of something I‚Äôll actually want. From puppy themed playing cards to battery powered string lights that have purple poop emojis on them. I‚Äôm not kidding. I‚Äôm a 19 year old boy and this is the majority of gifts I get from her. 

I don‚Äôt want to sound ungrateful but she‚Äôs wasting her money and I‚Äôve told her this year after year. I would rather one big present than a million small presents because in the end it‚Äôll probably be less money anyways. 

The point of all this is that I don‚Äôt know what to do with it all. It‚Äôs taking up space in my already small room with no closet and it‚Äôs all in bags. I don‚Äôt even look at or think about any of it. Can I just throw these unused things away? I get anxious about throwing things in the trash that can be donated/recycled/etc. so I guess some guidance on what to do with it and not feel bad for getting rid of it would be helpful.

"Is it wrong to do a Swedish Death Cleaning on your teenagers bedroom, even if they say there very emotionally attached to their items your throwing away and put up a strong rebuttal.(Asking for my mom)","A few days ago I took a pair of my moms hair cutting scissors and she found them in my room. She also found my room was a mess so she took trash bags and bagged up most of my old toys and belongings that weren‚Äôt hidden away in cabinets. This includes my doll collection which I have been working on for years and am VERY attached to. She left some dolls and some other things, and left things hidden in closets. But most of my things which I care about dearly are in trash bags half will go in storage, half will go in the trash. She also made new rules like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt have anything on my desk, nightstands or out at all‚Äù and she‚Äôll come and inspect every day to make sure it looks the way it was after she cleaned half my stuff out. My room feels empty, sad and I want my thing s back a lot, or at least some of them I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to just purge a teenagers room of their valuables like that especially if they put up a huge fight about it. My room exterior is all white and looks completely empty (she even took down posters I drew as a young kid because she says they look trashy) is she in the wrong for almost completely purging all of my things, most of which I‚Äôve had for years.

Update: I thought she was going to throw my stuff out, she decided instead just to leave it in bags in the hallway. Eventually we made a deal where I would go through everything, and make three piles. One pile to keep, one pile to go in storage and another to get donated or trashed. Also to make it up to me she went through the trash to get back a very large and special stuffed animal of mine that she had tossed down the shoot.

Getting rid of professional clothes that KIND of fit,"Yeah, just a random brag. In the beginning of my career as a lawyer I bought a lot of random clothing on clearance that kinda sorta fit.

The biggest mental roadblock for me is feeling like I wasted money when I get rid of something I barely/never used. By reframing the purchase as, ""what I was *really* buying was the dopamine hit so I did actually get value out of it"", it's weirdly helped me let go of things. 

That $50 board game I played once is my equivalent of buying ~~a gram~~ 3.5 grams of weed, and no one would expect a gram of weed to last forever right? And hell, you're getting a double serotonin hit with the act of decluttering.",declutter,1652291451.0

How to start EASY home-wide cleaning/decluttering/minimalizing in 1-2-3! (Long but worth it),"Pre-Context: So, I'm about to invest a good hour or so this morning into quick-cleaning my house. I deep cleaned it on Saturday, but my sister and her family including a 2-year-old came to visit yesterday, and the 2-year-old played her little heart out dragging all sorts of things from our playroom. I loved every second of it because she had a blast and so did my kids with her. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* **THIS POST FEELS LONG BUT WORTH IT I PROMSE!**

Disclaimer - the below is not how everyone does their clean-up/declutter/minimalizing routines, but it's worked well for me over the last ten years. Also, this is not a thorough deep clean, it's a start to help you breathe. Once you've done all three, you can do a deeper dive with the same concept later on.

&#x200B;

# 1-2-3: 

&#x200B;

* ***What to use***: 3 containers. Personally, I like two laundry baskets (LB) and one mid-sized storage container with no holes (TB - trash box). LB#1 will hold things that don't belong in the first room. LB#2 will be for things I instantly know can be donated. TB is literally just for trash that I can pour into our dumpster on the side of the house. Pouring it in instead of bothering with trash bags has worked for me better, but do what serves \***you**\* best. 
* ***Phase 1 - Intro*** 
   * Pick your first room. Put your three containers in the middle. Start your first 1-2-3 time routines.
      * Time #1 - Set a timer for 5 mins and aim to find all the trash you can easily see around the room and throw it in your TB. If you run out of things to throw away, jump to time #2.
      * Time #2 - Set a new timer for 5 mins and pick up everything easily spotted that does not belong in that room and put it in LB#1. If you finish before the timer goes off, jump to time#3.
      * Time #3 - Set a new timer for 5 mins, pick up any items around the room that you can easily decide within 10 seconds if you're ok with donating them and put them in LB#2. Don't go crazy trying to toss everything in the LB#2, this is for easy choice items. You'll be surprised at how many things you discover you are ready to donate. 
      * **NOTE: YOU WILL POTENTIALLY MISS THINGS FROM THOSE CATEGORIES IN THE FIVE-MINUTE INCREMENTS AND THAT'S FINE.**
* ***Phase 2 - Relaxed Clean***
   * Now that you've cleaned off the surface of the chaos, you can fine-tune your cleaning direction. If that means straightening a pillow on the couch or making the bed in your room, do your thing.
      * **Set a timer for 15 minutes and go wild, but stay in that room. If you find additional things that fit in your three containers, continue to utilize them.** (Dump your TB items into the outside trash dumpster/container as you need to regardless of the room you're currently working on.) 
      * **If you feel like you've finished before the 15 minutes goes by, feel free to go to your next room and restart the timer.** 
      * **If you feel like you're far from basic done at the end of 5 minutes, set another 5 and challenge yourself as if it were a race. Don't kill yourself, but have fun with the challenge!**
* **REPEAT PHASES 1 & 2 ROTATING ROOM BY ROOM IN YOUR HOME. As you go room by room, try to put away clear items from your LB#1.  You can do another walkthrough put away during phase 3 if you miss putting a few items away in phase 2.** 
* ***Phase 3 - Final walkthrough***
   * Now that you've gone through all the rooms with Phase 1 & 2, start back at the first room. Take a look around and see if there's anything simple you still need to address. If you're satisfied, pop out that vacuum and clean the floor. I'm amazed every time how good it feels after the vacuuming is done. Repeat to each room as is necessary. If you feel especially adrenaline-driven - feel free to grab a rag and your disinfectant of choice and wipe down counters in appropriate rooms. At the end, look at your LB#2 with the donate items and determine if they're ok being thrown in a big trash bag to donate, or if they're sturdy enough to need a box. If so, grab one if you have excess stored away, or you can ask for sturdy boxes from the banana section in your local grocery store. 

&#x200B;

I realize that's a lot to read, but if you can follow those 1-2-3's for a basic home-wide cleaning/declutter/minimizing - it'll help tremendously with the feeling of too much surrounding you.

"I went through years of make-up I hoarded and never used, cleared out my bathroom drawer, and have no regrets","I'm talking lipsticks, concealers eyeliner, mascara... I realized that this has been nearly a decade (if not more) of stuff just collecting that I don't use anymore. I should have taken before and after photos! I only use certain products anymore, especially with mascara and eyeliner.

I took photos of products I used to love but were either old or empty. Some I looked up immediately and knew I could find them on Amazon, eBay, or even Etsy. I'll eventually start buying those products one at a time (if I even remember to!) Clearly I haven't thought about them in a while, so it's no big deal if I don't obtain them anymore. Some were products I spoiled myself on (Sephora gift card way back when) and haven't been able to afford again. However, I won't miss what I haven't used.

I also cleaned out and threw in some trays to organize my bathroom drawer. It looks much better and is actually neat. Next feat is the bathroom closet.

Why am I doing all of this, you may ask? I'm starting a new job Monday, so I'm excited to truly pull all the punches I can in being prepared and stress-free.

Anyway, I got really into audiobooks back when they were on audio cassette, and I ended up saving a lot of them when CDs became a thing, and then when Audible became a thing, because they just weren't available in those formats.  So tonight, as I sort through the boxes the movers packed, I'm going through those audiobooks, and I found two with post-its on them: one for my dad, and one for an old friend (because I knew they'd *really* love them).  The thing is, both of them are now dead.

Please don't be like me.  If you have something you know someone will love, give it to them right away. And keep sorting through your stuff.  I just can't believe the old stuff I've found as I go through all these boxes.  But at least it's giving me the opportunity to get rid of this stuff now.",declutter,1653201857.0
My house is ready for close ups!,"After MONTHS of decluttering, tossing, donating, giving away, selling, and organizing to get my house ready to sell, I finished with hours to spare before the real estate photographer arrived. It looks beautiful. And clean. And tidy. Magazine worthy. All 3000 sq ft. of it. I really did have very nice things under all those overwhelming, mammoth piles.

While it‚Äôs never really ‚Äúfinished‚Äù as I still will have packing and likely tons more purging related to that to do (and not all the cupboards and closets that a potential buyer will open are totally tidy and the garage absorbed a lot in the final hours), it feels amazing. Afterwards, I crashed and slept harder than ever. The kind of physically and mentally exhausted nap where you‚Äôre not quite sure who, when, and where you are when you wake up.

Toward the end, the ‚Äúshould I or shouldn‚Äôt I get rid of this or that‚Äù became easier. The worst part is staring at those junk rooms full of nothing but things without a home and wondering how you‚Äôre going to find places/homes for everything. The tail end is much easier as it‚Äôs only a few things standing between you and utterly presentable. Much easier to make decisions then!

I feel lighter, proud to show my space, and ready for my new adventure!",declutter,1653324678.0
Your kids are watching...,"I just had a fit of giggles upon finding something my five year old did. 

Slowly over my decluttering/minimalism journey, I've been working on finding good ways that work for my home in terms of organizing what I have kept after decluttering purges. I've found some containers and organizers here and there that I enjoy and my kids see me using them all over the house, including their rooms. 


Y'all, my five year old took an empty egg carton from the inside recycle bin (I take out everything once a week to our recycle dumpster) and 'folded' all the Barbie clothes she could find in the playroom and put them in the egg carton just like those organizers with a bunch of tiny squares that you fold and tuck smaller things like socks or undies in. 

Kids are amazing guys. They're like sponges and they'll pick up on good habits if you practice them too. If you needed any extra motivation, consider this a fun one.

I removed an entire shelf in my fridge!,"I deep-cleaned my fridge the other day and decided to finally try this idea I‚Äôve had for a while.

There were three shelves in my crappy little fridge, and time and time again the middle shelf became like a food graveyard of sad leftovers and expired sauce. It blocked the view of the bottom shelf and the top shelf made it so you couldn‚Äôt see anything. Everything was so cramped. Not to mention it was really easy for something to spill and not be noticed‚Ä¶ old ketchup is really labor-intensive to clean, y‚Äôall.

There‚Äôs so much more room now! There‚Äôs no more weird hidey-holes for food to slip into, and since you can see both shelves properly, you can see what‚Äôs behind.

"Please tell me it‚Äôs ok to declutter my collectibles by donating, instead of selling!","I started collecting Squishmallows just before the pandemic hit and it just went crazy from there (I think many of us had a pandemic purchase that we went overboard on). I love them and I still plan on keeping a good amount but I am overwhelmed by the size of my collection. I just moved and I couldn‚Äôt believe how many boxes, so time to declutter!

I‚Äôve been doing great with decluttering and minimizing my life but I‚Äôve been dreading tackling my collection. I‚Äôve looked into selling them and I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt wanna ship it to people because I don‚Äôt wanna deal with shipping something that I wanna sell for so cheap and I‚Äôve heard horror stories about shipping issues with squish, people lying about not receiving them, processing fees, etc, and I‚Äôve never sold anything before.

I made a Facebook to use marketplace so that I can use local pick up instead, and I‚Äôll give that a shot, but I can already tell that there are posts that are pretty cheap and have been there for weeks or months! So the idea of it taking months to get rid of a squish for really cheap doesn‚Äôt really help my decluttering mindset.

To be 100% honest I just wanna donate them. I don‚Äôt wanna sell them, and even my husband is ok with that. But I see so many people in the Squishmallow community trading or selling them, it makes me feel like I should too and if I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm losing money. You know?

I think the money/purchase did it‚Äôs job when it gave me the joy when I first got them. And I think stressing over feeling like I have so much clutter and dealing with selling etc might not be worth the money especially because I‚Äôm not selling any rare or expensive ones (I wouldn‚Äôt make it expensive anyway because I truly dislike overpriced resellers)

I like minimalism as a concept but absolutely hate the aesthetic of it.,"I‚Äôm all for minimalism in terms of what it‚Äôs about. Getting rid of stuff you don‚Äôt need or use, (and want, to some extent), only keeping and using the things you need or want. 

That being said, I hate the blank empty spaces. It makes me so uncomfortable, especially when the furniture is white, like mine. Maybe this means I‚Äôm not a complete or full blown minimalist but it just looks to‚Ä¶sterile? Devoid of personality? Obviously one way to fix this would be to get different colored furniture but I‚Äôm not gonna do that. It‚Äôd be completely pointless as it‚Äôs nice furniture. I finally did get rid of some stuff yesterday (two boxes and a bag of clothes) and that was a really nice feeling and I cleared off the tops of my dressers and bookshelf and while they look nice and cleaner, I just really don‚Äôt like the white space.

"""You don't exist to serve your space. Your space exists to serve you."" - KC Davis, author of How to Keep House While Drowning","I'm currently listening to this audiobook while trying to motivate myself to go through an ""intermediate-level"" declutter. I've been on a decluttering journey for over 5 years now and slowly chipping away at overflowing things while listening to resources that are new-to-me in case new perspectives help.

I honestly don't know how to make my space serve me. I think this quote goes hand-in-hand a bit with ""a place for everything and everything in it's place"" since it makes sense to have a convenient and logical designated home for things I use often. But aside from my kitchen and bathroom spaces which have built-in organizational structures that have helped me in designating logical homes for my things, the rest of my small condo feels too much of a blank slate -- I have too many weirdly shaped items that belong in different categories to know what to do with them.

I need to either just wash the damned thing, or get rid of it.

"Please, for the love of God - HOW do I use up tea?","Okay listen. Like 80% of millennial-aged people, I have collected a dragon's horde of teas. I don't know. The cozy packaging traps me.

I know I can de-stash. I do, frequently. But everyone and their dog around me has their own tea horde and if we make eye contact I just end up leaving with ANOTHER box of teabags. I got a hamper for Christmas from my sister that included a *kilo* of loose leaf tea I'm 99% sure she de-stashed herself.

Part of the problem was that I would forget about them because they were tucked out of sight (behind other teas), so I've moved them to a more prominent position, which has helped. I'm also always cold-brewing a jug in my fridge on rotation, which is a good way to go through several teabags at once. I have a thermos, and since I'm doing No-Buy July I'll be taking more tea with me to work etc.

But I'm looking for other ways to use up tea a little less obvious than ""drink it"". Since June's theme here was the kitchen/pantry, did anyone have any recipes involving tea? It's winter here so both hot & cold recipes are welcome. Any surprising non-culinary uses (other than dying fabric)? Any benefits to bathing in it? Because I could. I've got black tea, green tea, herbals, florals, rooibos, hell, even mugicha, and that's not even tea. That's wheat. I'm the only person in my house who can tolerate gluten and I've gone and put it in the tea.

I'm giving it away as the opportunity arises, and it's not sensible to throw out since I *am* drinking it (I have already gotten rid of any I know I won't). It might not be as pressing as other issues but I would love any tips on how to burn through it *faster* as I would love to organise my hot-drinks shelf some time this century.

Edit: Probably too late, but - to be clear, this is not an issue of how to *get rid of* these teas. Otherwise I would gift or compost them! No charity wants these old, strange, already-opened teas. I'd rather just donate a couple new boxes of more normal tea. But more than that, I enjoy these teas. I'm drinking these teas. They're *my* teas. I would simply like ways to enjoy them faster or at higher volumes so that I can move on and enjoy different teas at a more reasonable pace.

Edit two: Thank you for all the comments! I really wasn't expecting this many responses. I can't reply to everyone, but I wanted to compile a list from everyone's suggestions for anyone else seeking inspiration:

* **Bake with it.** You can incorporate tea into sweet recipes like cookies, scones, chocolates, flan, jello, ice cream, cakes, loaves, etc. by steeping the tea into milk/cream, replacing some of the liquid with strongly brewed tea, or by grinding the tea into a powder.
* **Cook with it.** Tea can be used to impart flavour in savoury dishes; make tea eggs, infuse meats, fish or tofu with tea, add dry tea when smoking foods on a BBQ, make chazuke, use half-tea half-milk for oatmeal, soak burghul or couscous in hot tea, and cook rice in tea instead of water (jasmine tea and basmati rice are a great pair).
* **Bartend with it.** Strongly-brewed tea by itself can be used as a mixer - especially fruity/floral teas like hibiscus or passionfruit - or turned into a tasty simple syrup. You can also infuse leaves into vodka or freeze brewed tea into icecubes.
* **Bathe in it.** Not a joke! Caffeine has some hair & skin benefits, chamomile is soothing on the skin, and tea baths smell lovely. Cold tea bags can be used as an under-eye treatment.
* **Cold brew it.** I steep 3-4 tea bags in a jug of cold water overnight. It's so easy, and it can often mellow out teas that are unpleasantly strong or bitter when brewed hot.
* **Deodorise with it.** Tea bags can be used to deodorise shoes, bags, etc. and can potentially deter pests, especially mint tea. Loose leaf tea can act as a potpourri.
* **Make kombucha.** If you can't find someone to give you a scoby, then you can make some from store-bought kombucha if it says it includes the live mother.
* **Craft with it.** Tea can be used to dye fabrics a subtle beige, or give paper an ""aged"" appearance.

In light of all the suggestions to ""donate it to a food pantry"", I would like to say: Please don't treat food pantries like a trash can for food you don't want. The teas I have left are already opened, and most food banks wouldn't be able to accept them, especially loose leaf teas of questionable origin.

Donations like this can be like sending ragged, unwearable clothes to a thrift store - it's just garbage the volunteers have to spend their time sorting through. Smaller, local charities may have more lenient rules, so it's worth asking them, but the only pantries operating near me would just have to throw it out. I do think there was a miscommunication somewhere in my post, because if I gave the impression that I didn't *want* my tea and was just looking for any excuse to get rid of it, that was not the case; but even so, if I don't clear out certain teas soon, I'm going to be offering them to local mothers' groups and community centres in case they can/will accept them.

Thank you again for all the awesome ideas! I'm gonna try a bunch of these - I'll be posting my successes over at r/noscrapleftbehind.",declutter,1656741567.0

It finally happened. Something I was hanging onto to use at a future date was needed. And it broke instantly.,"I‚Äôm sharing this in case you‚Äôre saving that one special item that you just *know* will be useful in the future. 

Well, I was hanging on to a plant grow light for when I decided to grow seedlings again. A majority of my plants are a mature size (or as mature as their pots will allow), and they‚Äôve been acclimated to their conditions in my tiny balcony, and said tiny balcony is too small to grow too many new plants. 

I decided to swap out a couple plants and get some new ones in my collection, and lo and behold, even though it had been at least 5 years, it was time to whip out the ol‚Äô grow light! 

Well. It didn‚Äôt work. 

Not only did it not work, but it sputtered out with bright flashes of light before finally kicking the bucket. All in about 15 seconds. 

I had been saving this lamp for *just this occasion*‚Ä¶. and it died. I was saving it for so long because 6-7 years ago, this lamp was rather new on the market, and I had spent a pretty penny on it. I knew I was an avid plant enthusiast, so it was *only a matter of time* before I had to use it again. 

So I‚Äôm back online looking up new grow lights, and guess what! To my surprise, grow lights have come a LONG way in both usability and affordability. My light required a separate timer to be purchased so you could set the lamp duration, and it required its own stand to attach to. They‚Äôre all built in nowadays! And for $20! Stand it up, plug it in, set it, and forget it (until watering day). Incredible. 

I know not everyone is saving their old grow lamp that‚Äôs old enough to be a second grader, but I know there‚Äôs something you‚Äôre hanging on to for *just the right moment.* Well, it‚Äôs time to let go of that item. Not only will it not be guaranteed to work (heck, my lamp was in a temperature controlled garage in a plastic bin alone), but by the time you will need it, the new ones on the market will blow it out of the water.",declutter,1658278216.0

You Can't Give This Sh*t Away: On Trying to Sell Your Stuff,"This is a lesson I've learned that I wanted to share after six years of decluttering. I hope this doesn't sound preachy or anything since, as I'm about to illustrate, I'm the slowest learner of them all.

I made the teensy mistake of vastly overestimating how much my used crap was worth. I see so many people doing it - people selling their H&M clothes for $5 less than retail price, people selling their used blenders for over $100, and people selling printers that no longer work for the extremely low price of 40% under retail.

At one point I started looking through my remaining stuff to give away for free what I hadn't been able to sell. It was just cluttering my space and it just wasn't worth it anymore to hold onto stuff for literally years, posting and reposting them just to get $20 for them - I'd rather just skip a few fast food trips.

To my surprise, a lot of the stuff I had been trying to sell, some for a pretty decent amount of money, I LITERALLY COULD NOT GIVE AWAY. Nobody claimed it, for FREE. It's not that nobody in the world wanted it, but unfortunately when you're selling used stuff you have to hope that the right person comes along, and that could take a long time.

So if you have stashes of ""I'll sell that"" items, I'd encourage you to pick just a few you're willing to part with and post them for free, especially lower value stuff, to see how much your stuff is actually worth to the rest of the world. For example, I had things like books, clothes, a heavy duty lock, a makeup bag, posters, collectible coins, etc. that weren't claimed for free, or at least took a while. Take some of your other stuff and slash the price, and see if it even sells. Your blenders, your printer, your sofa. Also consider how much time you're willing to spend trying to sell it - chances are you're paying yourself well under minimum wage to get rid of a lot of stuff. Set a limit and stick to it.

Ultimately you can't sell your way out of buyer's remorse. You're never, ever going to get back the money you spent on that impulse buy, or even half of it. But you can give your old blender to someone who needs it (remember that the person who's taking the time to come get your blender probably isn't rich, and you're helping them by saving them $50 on a new one), and then go out for dinner and have a nightcap in your beautiful, clean space free of physical representations of your financial regrets. It'll hurt for, like, 10 minutes, and then it'll feel great.",declutter,1659847334.0
Declutter Success: Getting rid of organizing and storage bins,"Something amazing has happened. I had this huge plastic dresser/drawer that was as tall as my hip and had 4 drawers filled with art & craft supplies. I decluttered so much that every item is gone. I stared at the huge empty drawer/storage/organizer and thought, ""What can I put in it? I don't have anything to put in it. It's a good item, so surely I can find a use for it?"" I thought about shoving it back into my closet but had an epiphany: I didn't need it anymore! I could get rid of it! 

It's gone to the thrift shop where I'm sure it'll be bought quickly by a lucky person who needs it. It's no longer calling for me to put stuff in it. I won't be tempted to fill it by buying new stuff because I won't have any empty drawers to put them. I feel free!! 

Then it happened again and again. I had four tubs (about the size of a breadbox) also filled with items. All the items inside have been decluttered and I was left with four very well-made organization tubs. I thought, ""These are nice but... I don't... need them anymore???""

I helped my mom declutter her pantry. Some takeaways.,"I helped my mom declutter her pantry. Here are some takeaways I was reminded of:

1. I could only help because she was ready to accept help. Emotion often trumps logic when it comes to her and her things but after I have been very supportive for long enough, she finally came around. 

2. It was her pantry, not mine. While I had my own expectations of what I would keep in/toss from the pantry and how to arrange it, I had to let her make these decisions herself. She just needed the willpower to clear them out entirely to start anew. Which brings me to the next point. 

3. It helps significantly when you remove everything from the space you're decluttering. Hard reset is the best way. You can take account of everything and see the empty space as a new opportunity. 

4. Decluttering is a process. We got a lot done today, but the jury is still out on what to do with a few things. It can't all be done in a day, but pat yourself on the back for the small victories. You should be getting more excited the more you work on reclaiming the space! ‚úåÔ∏è",declutter,1660354822.0
"My father-in-law was a hoarder because everything was ""useful"". After he passed, 99% of it went into the garbage.","My father-in-law had a battle with dementia and we lost him last year. He had a very nice little house with a fully finished basement, a massive cold room (I mean you could fit 3 couches in this thing), a small kitchen, living room, enclosed porch, 2 bedrooms, and 1 bathroom. Every single room, floor to ceiling, was packed with stuff. He only kept the areas clear that he needed to live in. He also had a 2 story garage/barn that was full of stuff, again, everywhere you looked.

Why? Well, according to my husband, he was always frugal and a saver. Everything had a use. If he saw something on the side of the road, he picked it up. He saved everything. Literally everything.

We knew it was going to be a massive undertaking, and it took 6+ months to clean it out with at least a dozen people helping whenever they had free time. He had a large cabinet in his living room full of stuff. When I cleaned it out, most of it was old peanut butter jars that had been cleaned out and stuffed full of nails, screws, or various plastic bags from the grocery store or other random products. In his attic, we found empty bags of cookies from the 1980s. We found at least 5 sets of dinnerware all neatly wrapped up and put into a box. And so many boxes of clothes that had sat for so long they were matted together. Leather boots that had long since rotted because they were saved for so long. Broken typewriters, broken instruments, broken porch swings, broken TVs and microwaves he would someday ""fix"".

We tried to be mindful when cleaning out his house. We had someone come in and remove anything that could be salvaged for metal. We donated everything we thought was worth donating. We sold items online to be split between his kids.

You know what? 99% of the shit he saved went into a dumpster. A dumpster that cost money for us to have hauled away. We barely earned anything by selling all his stuff we hoped would have value, not nearly enough to cover the cost of throwing away all the junk.

Even worse is the mementos we did find from my husband's childhood. Most of them were donated or thrown away. Why? Well, one, my husband and his sister were appalled by the state of their dad's house and didn't want to follow in his footsteps. Two, so many of those mementos were damaged or rotted away that they had to be thrown into the garbage. Three, they didn't mean shit to my husband or his sister. My FIL kept these things for his kids, and 99% of it went into the garbage. We ended up with 2 items from his entire house - an antique clock, and a little wooden elephant statue.

I hope this inspires some of you today to continue decluttering and avoid saving items you don't use or need. I also highly recommend looking into Swedish Death Cleaning if you are more interested in the idea of ""What happens to all my stuff after I die?""",declutter,1660789473.0
I decluttered a small area without my friend and it was so exciting.,"My friend has spent a total of 20 hours in my home helping me declutter my daughter's room, her playroom, and then the ""movie room"" in the basement. She also spent another two hours on the phone with me while I sorted through what we called the ""guest room"" but was basically the family closet with a bed. 

Her and her family are on vacation and I have the weekend to myself. I told her I wanted to work on the kitchen and dining area next. Without saying she didn't have to be there for me to do it, she encouraged me to try it for myself. I was able to declutter our table and buffet and even moved on to the couch in the living room. 

She has changed my life for the better and has given me the tools to be successful without her. 

What a gift. Happy weekend all. :)",declutter,1661024185.0
"I did it!! I decluttered 1,000 items!","It started July 26. In less than a month, I've decluttered 1,000 items! My goal was to declutter that much by the end of August, but I finished early! My new goal will probably be 2,022 items by December 31 for the year 2022! 

I'm so happy! I watched a ton of decluttering videos on Youtube for inspiration. They kept me going! Most of the tips, techniques, and psychology discussed in the videos were common sense, nothing I hadn't heard before, and nothing new, but there was one method described in a video that really struck me. 

The woman in the video started by saying \[I'm summarizing\], ""Imagine you're in school and you have one teacher who keeps assigning you massive amounts of homework. Every day, there's more and more and to make it worse, most of it is busy work. None of it is that important or worth doing! You don't want to do it, but you feel compelled to because your teacher assigned all these projects and assignments! That's just like all the items you keep in your home for all the projects you tell yourself you will do in the future, but you end up not doing them. You keep accumulating more items for ""future projects,"" but those future projects never get done. Meanwhile, the ""To Do"" list of items keeps growing and growing. Every time you look at the stuff in your room, you're reminded of all the things you SHOULD do, but aren't doing. You just had fun collecting the items and imagining doing projects instead of actually doing them. Meanwhile, your ""To Do"" list gets bigger and bigger, more and more stressful, and now you can't even relax in your room anymore because you're constantly reminded of everything you should or could be doing instead of what you *want* to do. It's time to let go of your To Do lists. Let go of the projects. Let yourself breathe and relax.""

As someone with a million arts & craft supplies for projects I'd love to do but haven't gotten around to them in years, this hit home. Watching videos on the Sunk Cost Fallacy also helped a lot!",declutter,1661128944.0
Ironic decluttering problem,"I‚Äôm pretty good at decluttering and organizing, but like most people there are one or two categories that I find more difficult. Other than sentimental items, my most difficult category is, ironically, the tools and items used for organizing. Boxes, bins, drawer dividers, over-the-door organizers, small wire shelves and turntables for the kitchen, baskets, etc. Ultimately, I can make myself get rid of them, but it‚Äôs not easy. It‚Äôs a good thing that I can see the humor in the situation.

By brutally culling the Tupperware‚Ä¶,"‚Ä¶we opened up a whole kitchen cabinet. By moving our cake/loaf pans and other baking miscellany into that cabinet, we then cleared a whole shelf in the bottom cabinet of the china hutch. By moving some tableware for special occasions (butter dish, gravy boat, condiment bowls) onto that shelf, we could move some pretty barware into the windowed upper part of the hutch. This in turn allowed us to consolidate all of our day-to-day drinking glasses and mugs onto one shelf, which meant the cereal bowls could have their own spot, which subsequently makes it much easier to grab our large dinner plates (because the cereal bowls aren‚Äôt stacked on top of them). 

Of course, along the way there were some other items we realized we didn‚Äôt need (chipped cereal bowls, stupid coffee mugs, that one mini bundt pan that never releases cleanly). But even just getting rid of ONE moderately overgrown category resulted in a cascade of positive organizational changes.

Listing house on Wednesday. Took 6 months but successfully decluttered ENTIRE HOUSE!!,"I feel like I can breath again!  


I am the collector of stuff and things while my husband is content with owning very little.

Donating‚Ä¶and knowing it‚Äôs just delaying its path to the landfill.,"I know most thrift stores are overwhelmed with stuff and end up just throwing it into a landfill or dumping it onto an impoverished country (which then hurts their local economy when people who make clothes/items there have no place to sell them)

Because of this, I hit a paralysis when decluttering/purging my home of the stuff I‚Äôve accumulated.  I end up feeling guilty because I‚Äôm just contributing to our ecological nightmare by donating and know that *someone* could use it.

Brother's girlfriend keeps trying to dump their clutter on us and I don't know what to do,"This started roughly a year ago. Once a while she would come over and bring 1-2 big boxes or bags filled with her old clothing for me to look through. This has happened probably three or four times. How and why she has so much clothing is beyond me.
Anyways, few months ago she started trying to give us their unwanted decoration here and then. My brother and she are moving soon and now it's all gotten worse. Few weeks ago she wanted me to look at some random books that she bought _for decoration_. Then she asked if I wanted some of her old bed sheets. A few days ago she brought even more of their old stuff that they don't want to keep. Just now I received a message and by the notification I can see that she wants to know if I want some deco light.

I am so tired of this. I have tried to decline politely, for example one time she asked if I wanted a coat and sent a picture. Her style is pretty cheugy and I don't like it, so I replied with ""I already have a jacket for winter so I don't need it, but thanks"". She still brought it the next time she came over! She said it wasn't a winter jacket yada yada. To the bedsheet offer I just said that I had already bought new sets recently (which is true).

I am not a confrontational person and I have trouble saying no. I'm tired of basically being her clutter dump.

Edit: I just woke up and I didn't expect this post to blow up so much... I just needed a place to vent/rant about this. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read my post and maybe even decided to leave a comment. I appreciate it!! I'll try to read them all and reply. I texted my brother's girlfriend now ""No, but thanks for the offer"". I hope her dumping will stop. Otherwise I'll tell her that I can't take the stuff in because I'm decluttering and trying to live more minimalistically.",declutter,1661872512.0

Reframing decluttering as a ‚Äútreat‚Äù,"Like a lot of people, I tend to feel a lot of guilt and anxiety getting rid of things that were expensive or that I tell myself might be useful in the future. 

A mental shift that has really helped me is thinking of getting rid of something I don‚Äôt like as a treat in the same way buying something new could be a treat. But instead of spending the money now, the treat is giving myself permission to get rid of something I don‚Äôt love or need now and to potentially spend the money to replace it, if needed. 

The other part of the ‚Äútreat‚Äù idea is remembering the value of having a less cluttered space. I just got rid of a big picture frame that I had shoved behind a bookcase and found it really helpful just to take a step back and note that it looked a lot nicer and neater afterwards. This is my home and there is a real value to having it look nice and be a pleasant space! 

I hope some of you find this helpful too!",declutter,1662239127.0
I‚Äôve embraced my ‚Äòfantasy self‚Äô,"I‚Äôve (49f) become reasonably minimalist in recent years and love watching YouTube videos about how I can declutter and reduce my ‚Äúinventory‚Äù. Anything I keep has to serve a purpose and be something I love and use or appreciate often.

Many videos recommended reducing my wardrobe to only the items I wore and to ‚Äúlet go‚Äù of anything I kept for my ‚Äúfantasy self‚Äù. For me my ‚Äòfantasy self‚Äô wore dresses while the ‚Äòreal me‚Äô wore tunic tops with jeans, jeggings or smart trousers. I‚Äôm a bit top heavy, so longer tunic tops balance me out a bit better even though trousers make me feel a bit frumpy. I also have problems with my (stupidly small) feet so wear trainers/sneakers because shoes are just too uncomfortable.

Anyway, I was going through my small wardrobe/closet and was struggling to part with a couple of dresses I still had. They weren‚Äôt party dresses but were really cute and I‚Äôd always wanted to be a ‚Äòcute dress‚Äô kind of woman. So I tried one on and was amazed at how comfortable it felt and how flattering it looked. Paired with some pretty sneakers it looked casual but still cute and was everything I wanted it to be but never dared hope for. 

So now I‚Äôve bought another pair of pretty pumps/sneakers that are comfortable but go really well with both dresses and have even bought another dress. I wore a dress to work last week for the first time ever and got so many compliments I was almost embarrassed (I don‚Äôt normally like attention but these were from my work friends and they tend to say what they mean). When I got home my husband was ‚Äúooh, you look nice‚Äù too, which made my day. I‚Äôm nearly 50 and it‚Äôs been a long time since anyone has commented on anything other than my hair!

So it seems my ‚Äòfantasy self‚Äô has become my real self and I‚Äôll be decluttering my ‚Äòold self‚Äô this weekend!!

I‚Äôd encourage anyone in the same rut to just give it a try. Wear that outfit you‚Äôve always wanted to try out. You‚Äôve got nothing to lose and might even find your real self at the back of that wardrobe/closet.

(Edited typo in age)


Another Edit: THANK YOU to the many who responded to this, I honestly didn‚Äôt expect more than a couple of people to comment. Certainly not so many positive and encouraging comments. But then we‚Äôre pretty good for that on this subreddit. I even had a couple of awards. I‚Äôm so so happy to be both wholesome and helpful.

Anyway, I am so happy to have made people smile, encouraged them to embrace their ‚Äòfantasy selves‚Äô - whether that‚Äôs wearing certain clothes or it‚Äôs accepting themselves as they actually are - or just filled an empty few minutes in an otherwise ordinary day.

"7 light pink nail polishes, none of which I liked or used","They all either applied unevenly or didn‚Äôt suit me, but I had a weird mental block about decluttering them. Yesterday I was paring down my cosmetics to fit in my new, smaller vanity. I wanted to store all my nail polishes in a particular small tray, and needed to get rid of at least four or five bottles for that to happen. 

While trying to decide which of my three green polishes‚Äî all of which I love and wear regularly‚Äî I should toss, I realized that I was operating under an irrational subconscious belief that one must have at least one version of each major sensible color if one wants three versions of a niche shade. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt rationalize having multiple ‚Äúimpractical‚Äù greens without having a respectable, ‚Äúpractical‚Äù blush. So, for literal *years*, I have been hanging onto all 7 pink bottles because I, disliking them all, couldn‚Äôt decide which token to keep.

Turns out that you *don‚Äôt* actually need a bottle of light pink nail polish that you don‚Äôt like or use to justify having other colors that you do. Likewise, you can save the ice cream maker but donate the microwave if you want. You can wear those neon green, sequined, over-the-knee boots without owning a pair of plain black pumps. You can keep the antique player piano and the gramophone but get rid of the Bluetooth speaker. Hell, there‚Äôs no law that you must possess a couch when you vastly prefer sitting in your living room hammock. If THE sensible choice is not YOUR sensible choice, you can jettison the ‚Äúpractical‚Äù items and keep the ‚Äúimpractical‚Äù items. 

Anyways, put all 7 bottles on the curb today and it‚Äôs funny how such a little thing makes a big mental difference.",declutter,1663784764.0
It's crazy finding old items and work of yours that speaks loudly of the kind of person you used to be and what you believed in.,"First off, I want to say thank you to the community and everyone who supported me on my last post. I thought I was being too emotional and wasn't expecting much, but it really gave me hope in a really bad time in my life.

Anyways, day 5 of decluttering my room has been a very slow decluttering day. My heart and mind are very heavy today. I'm not feeling well at all. I've dumped many things in a pile to sort from two drawers and some room decorations.

Amongst the decorations I found a few items hidden inside of things. These items were from before a traumatic time in my life. Also, I found artwork and school work from around the same time and directly after. Everything speaks loudly about how much life and personality I used to have.

I used to be a free spirit. I used to feel so much and love so much. I believed in so much and stuck to my true self that I left everything to be a better version of myself. A lot has happened since and I couldn't pick myself back up. Everytime it felt like I was doing it I got trapped in another cycle. I feel like a muted version of myself now. I've had this feeling for years. 

Five days of decluttering has been like peeling back the layers of my life. It feels like a movie. It feels like the mess has covered up who I am and who I have wanted to be.

Discovered and excellent resource to help with decluttering and tidying up,"I have always been a messy person. I'm good at tidying if everything has a place, but the minute there are too many things and not enough places it's like my brain short-circuits and I can't *do* anything. Plus I find it much easier to hang on to things ""just in case"" than I do to throw them out, so it's really easy for me to wind up with more things than places.

Since I was little my spaces have been cluttered, and it hasn't really bothered me. Then I had a kid, which on one hand increased  the amount of stuff on hand exponentially, and on the other hand made it much less practical to be as cluttered as I am.

My mom is a very sentimental person (when I still lived at home she would often go through bags of things I had decided to get rid of and be like ""awww why are you getting rid of this???"") so I feel bad being so apathetic.

On the brighter side, I recently decluttered their 3 bathroom cabinets and threw out an entire kitchen sized trash can full of things that have been there since we moved in (they've been in their current home for 19 years) and I think seeing all of the space in them has kickstarted her into getting rid of unnecessary things so that I'm not left to deal with them in future years.

Confession of when I was a ‚Äúsecret hoarder‚Äù,In my room I have a mini closet/attic type of deal. When I was 14-18 I was a bit of a hoarder and shopaholic. I always worked for my money but never saved it. In those 4 years I accumulated so much junk I never used and instead of donating it or throwing it out I would put it in the closet. It was bad to the point where you couldn‚Äôt walk in there. In hindsight I was struggling with my mental health. When I was 19 I decided to seek therapy and psychiatric help I got better but the one thing in my life that really bothered me was that closet. Sometimes at night I would wish that part of the house would catch on fire so I wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with it. I discovered a Declutter video on YouTube and made it a goal to clean that closet. 1 month and 50 trash bags later it was clean and I felt so proud. 3 years later I‚Äôve managed to keep it clean I only keep my baby crib (eventually will donate once I move out) and a bin of winter/ baby clothes in there.

"I got the greatest compliment, and the one who said it doesn't even know I heard it!","Last week, some of our friends visited our house for the first time.

"I let go of a few ""spark joy"" items - and I'm okay with it","Decluttered one of my kitchen cabinets today and despite the fact they ""sparked joy"" I purged two serving trays and a diffuser pitcher.  

The pitcher was bought esp. for me as a gift by a loved one who I care about very much.  They were so excited to give it to me because they picked it out following a conversation we had about using one and I mentioned I didn't have one.  Truth is I never wanted one, don't remember the conversation and despite liking the idea of one ... have only used it twice without liking the outcome.  But still the pitcher sparked joy because of the wonderful memory of this person putting so much effort into getting me the ""perfect"" gift. 

The serving trays were a yard sale find and they were ""perfect"" - right color to match my kitchen, themed shape that matched my decor.  I remember how excited I was to discover these and eager I was to get them home ... where they have sat ... used maybe three times in 20 years ... because, it turns out those themed shapes rarely match what I want to serve when I actually do host a gathering ...which is rare.  

Both brought joy to my life when they entered it.  Both still made me smile when I encountered them.  And now both can go forth to hopefully have a more useful life for someone else.  They were useful items in good condition that I liked - but I am at the point where I just don't want to keep things that I am only going to use once every several years.   

And now my cake pans and mixing bowls (which I use several times every year) fit better in the cabinet and I can get them in and out easier.",declutter,1667057701.0
I gave up.,"I‚Äôm not sure how this will be received here, but I thought I‚Äôd share anyway in case anyone is struggling like I was. 

I‚Äôve always had mental health issues and a problem with staying on top of my home, both with actual clutter and cleanliness. I got into minimalism years ago and consider it my saving grace. My home was mostly in order for a long time.

Enter the last few years. After a move to a much smaller house, welcoming our first child and getting PPD while having a husband that works 6 days a week, experiencing chronic fatigue and oh yeah, going through a freaking pandemic I lost control of my home. Again.

I did what I usually do when this happens. I got stuff ready for different donation places based off of need. I stored everything that required special recycling (electronics, plastic bags). I set aside things to ask if certain family members wanted them. Kept a few things to be listed for sale. Etc.

I completed these tasks successfully for a while, but as time went on and my mental/physical health deteriorated things got worse. The to-do list got too long. It didn‚Äôt seem to matter how fast I cleaned stuff out, my daughter always needed something new or grew out of something old that would take up the space I had just created. I felt like I was on a hamster wheel not making any noticeable progress, just barely holding the line steady.

Until I wasn‚Äôt anymore and things got bad. Too cluttered. Unhygienic. My toddler‚Äôs room started to morph into a storage room for all of these waiting to be dealt with items. I couldn‚Äôt clean things properly because I couldn‚Äôt easily access the areas I needed to.

One day as I once again began to chip away at the pile, something in me snapped and I just.. threw it all away. That is correct. I threw it all in the trash. My mental health had gotten so bad, our home so full that I was struggling to function in it and properly care for my child. So I got rid of it all in one fell swoop.

No charity runs. No special recycling. No saving things for certain people. No social media postings. No sale listings. Everything gone, just like that. 

It‚Äôs been a month since then and I still don‚Äôt quite know how to feel about what I did. Regardless of whether it was the right thing to do or not, I am now able to easily do the things I need to do to care for myself and my daughter, and because of this my mental health is better than it‚Äôs been since I had her nearly 2 years ago. It‚Äôs been easier on me physically too. So I ultimately don‚Äôt regret taking back control of my home even though I wish it had been under better circumstances.

I‚Äôm hesitant to say this but if you‚Äôre going through something similar and things are getting dark both in your mind and in your space, I am giving you permission to just chuck it all. To have a clean slate so you can stabilize and remove the impediments to caring for yourself and your family. To not recycle or donate or post every little thing. Your well-being is more important than the stuff. Your home is not a storage facility nor a trash can. It‚Äôs alright to let go of doing things the right way, the best way in order to survive. 

Sometimes we have to burn it all down to start anew. Sometimes we don‚Äôt have the spoons to do this decluttering thing ‚Äòproperly‚Äô and that is okay. I hope to resume my old way of giving things away to proper homes in the future, but in the meantime while that is not possible I must remind myself I still have the power to reclaim my home and so do you.

Hats off to all of you on this journey who are battling mental and physical illnesses. Don‚Äôt let the guilt stop you from saving yourself.",declutter,1667234042.0
Getting rid of all scraps and random pieces I called 'lounge wear',"And investing in two proper pairs of lounge wear/daily wear that are my size, that I can mix and match and wear almost every day comfortably have been a game changer. Everything that I didn't want to wear outside anymore, I put in the lounge wear pile, but I quickly realized I was doing myself a disservice. I didnt want to wear those things outside because there was always some issue with it, pants that are too tight, blouse that is uncomfortable, tshirt that has a hole, all of those things and more. I WFH most of the days so, waking up and changing out of the sleepwear to a nice pair of loungewear that fits me and is comfy, has made such a positive impact on my self esteem. I can also quickly run small errands or groceries with it. It feels like I'm always ready. Plus having just two to three pair of daily wear has made my daily life so much easier, removed a ton of clutter from my wardrobe (this doesnt include my gym wear).

"Inherited my grandparents extremely cluttered house, and I‚Äôm overwhelmed.","I had been living with my grandpa for the last month while his health deteriorated and a few days ago he passed. It was good for the both of us as the house I had been renting came back positive with asbestos AFTER renovations had been done, so obviously I had to move out quickly. Now it‚Äôs been decided that I‚Äôll get to live in his house. 

He and my grandmother lived in the same house for 60 years and both of them were borderline hoarders. There are papers and books EVERYWHERE. Neither of them cleaned things so everything was filthy. The kitchen had almost no usable counter space despite it having more cabinets than I have ever seen in a single kitchen because they had every kitchen gadget imaginable. Grandpa had almost 30 mugs despite living by himself the past 5 years. Four drawers are dedicated just to dish towels. There is an entire room that had just a few feet of walkable floor because the rest was jam packed with hunting stuff and photographs. 

I‚Äôve had to throw out so much because it‚Äôs been destroyed by mice and bugs, which has been killing me since normally I‚Äôm very eco-conscious. Countless heirlooms have been lost. I‚Äôm trying my best to sort out things to donate but I‚Äôm way out in the country and I straight up don‚Äôt have the room to have bags sit around until I can make a trip. 

Im so glad I have family here to help sort but we‚Äôre at a point where we‚Äôre all exhausted. Plus I‚Äôve been having to work around my dad because he tends to hoard things too and he keeps setting things aside that ‚Äúdon‚Äôt need to go yet‚Äù or ‚Äúcould be useful‚Äù. It‚Äôs hard to deal with that while also trying to  figure out how to live here. 

Despite all this I really do love this house. I know I need to just give it time and cut myself slack, but I‚Äôm so uncomfortable at the moment with all the gross clutter. 

Mostly I just needed to vent, but how do I stay motivated while faced with such a huge task? I‚Äôm burned out but I need to keep going to make my area safe and clean.",declutter,1667685742.0

Struggling to declutter because of landfill-anxiety? YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT RIDWELL!!!,"**EDIT: PLEASE SCROLL TO THE PART ABOUT RIDWELL IF YOU WISH TO SKIP MY VENT**

I am someone who struggles with intense feelings of responsibility for my possessions and anxiety about contributing to landfill/general sustainability impact of my decluttering decisions.

The argument ""it was destined for landfill as soon as it was created"" does NOT work for me because, by sending something that COULD be recycled to landfill prematurely, you are increasing the demand for more of the virgin material to be produced -- which causes fossil fuel use, water usage, energy consumption, pollution, etc.

Because of this, my house has entered a sort of semi-hoarder state because it is SO DIFFICULT to dispose of things responsibly. I have a huge pile of styrofoam because the nearest drop off for recycling styrofoam is an hour away. I have boxes and boxes and boxes of old clothes because I want to sort them to go to a destination that is likely to use them vs trash them (so I will take the time to bring business-wear to dress for success rather than Goodwill). I have bags of old lightbulbs, batteries, and OMG the mountain of plastic bags in my basement. This doesn't even begin to describe everything I've been holding onto.

The effort associated with researching and then actually responsibly disposing of the various types of trash, plus the sheer volume of it all, causes me to try to optimize my time by taking as few trips as possible. So I spend a bunch of time sorting everything into categories. Then I burn out, or my depression flares for a few weeks, or maybe I have people over and need to quickly shove everything out of sight (ruining my organization scheme). Some way or another the piles sit and I forget my intent with them (I also have ADHD). Then maybe my cats pee on them, or mice shit all over them, so I have to go through the effort of cleaning the items. Then I set them aside and completely forget they exist, only to later have to re-find them and re-categorize/collect them. I feel like I am stuck in a perpetual cycle of organizing and cleaning, and relatively little of my hoard actually makes it out of the house. I've actively tried to de-hoard my home for like 7 years now, and while I've made a lot of progress, there is still a *long* ways to go.

I HATE living like this and I'm very consciously aware that I spend waaaaaaayyyy too much of my precious time on this planet dealing with trash!!! My husband and I have fought a ton about this, but I really struggle to break my moral code even though I know we're drowning and I'm destroying our quality of life.

**EDIT: HERE IS THE PART ABOUT RIDWELL**

Anyways, I just signed up for a service called Ridwell last night and I am LOSING MY FREAKING MIND. They do regular pick ups of hard-to-recycle items like clothing, plastic bags, batteries, lightbulbs, etc, as well as 1 roving category each pick up for other tough decluttering items!!!!!!!!!!! For example, after Halloween they picked up unused Halloween candy. They have an upcoming pick up for medical mobility equipment -- crutches, boots, slings, etc -- I LITERALLY HAVE A HUGE BOX OF MEDICAL MOBILITY EQUIPMENT THAT I HAVE HELD ONTO FOR YEARS because I felt bad throwing the items away, but had NO IDEA what to do with it. I'm so ecstatic!!!

This service is about to CHANGE MY LIFE. Every roving pick up, I can just Konmari that category and leave it on my porch. EVERYTHING that they pick up is reused or recycled. They pick up clothing each time, so they donate all the clothes in good condition and recycle ALL unusable clothes (provided they aren't soiled). I literally have so much guilt over sending fabric to landfill, because I know 99% of it is recyclable but don't know WHERE to recycle it. So I have a huge box of ripped clothes that I intended to mend before donating. Now I can just recycle them!!!!! This is a dream come true.

It's only $12/month for me. If you struggle with sustainability guilt in your decluttering like I do, please check them out and see if they service your area!!!",declutter,1667930669.0

Buy Nothing Groups for decluttering,"I had boxes of stuff to donate. Most of it was good, I kept things for years and I felt guilty about throwing it out and was too lazy to donate.

Not everything I posted online was wanted but the pile got smaller so when I was on about 3 boxes I took the trip to my local donation center. 

You can also get things for free but my mindset was to get rid of my things instead of bringing new things in the house. It's a good way to give things a new life that my otherwise have gone to a landfill or who knows where. And it stays super local.

I kept a cute leather pair of Dansko Mary Janes in my closet for literally ten years and when I finally wore them for the 2nd or 3rd time, they were DISINTEGRATING beneath my feet. I first noticed they were tracking rocks into the house from the gravel driveway. I was like ??? I tried to pick them out to not ruin the hardwood at my boyfriend's house. But the shoes were like, disintegrating, pulling the rocks out also pulled apart the base of the shoe. I tried scratching the bottoms of the shoes on the pavement to get the rocks out, and black rubber crap from the shoes was coming off! These are shoes that are traditionally very hardy-nurses often wear them. But because they (were purchased gently used have no idea how old) sat in my closet for ten years, I guess they disintegrated?

I threw the shoes away. What use is it to store ""nice things"" if they literally disintegrate or go down in usability due to neglect and age???

Letting go is so much easier after you've made peace first.,"I'll avoid the long story behind it, but today my college kid was moving into our front room.  In the area are a set of shelves that have been the ""toy shelves"" for over two decades.  Realizing his bed would be blocking access to them, I decided to take the time to declutter them first.

Things I learned/realized:

1) Although in my mind these were the shelves for toys we kept for the grand-kids - truth is there wasn't much ""toy"" on there.  No wonder they just head straight for the Lego bins when they arrive.

2) I haven't touched these shelves in a long time because I didn't have the ""time"" to declutter them.  Decluttering and cleaning them took less than 40 min total.

3) Having made peace inside myself with a few facts first really helped me quickly do these shelves.  

... I knew the top of the shelves was slightly damaged and it needs repainting.  I can do that later - for now just covering it with a festive cloth.   

... I made peace with the fact that the grandkids love the legos we have (entire bins elsewhere in the house) and aren't so little anymore (preschool/elementary age vs toddler).   So no, toddler toys hold little interest.  

... I made peace with the fact that toys get worn out over loving use - and that worn out toys need tossed, not preserved. They have a finite life and that's okay - I do not need to rehab or resurrect them. 

So with those thoughts in mind, I quickly tossed damaged puzzles, torn books and random pieces.  I combined and boxed those things worth keeping (domino set, books, dinosaurs, wood blocks).  I bagged up a few decent condition but not needed other items to donate.  And then after a quick spray and wipe - I was done.   Went from 5 seemingly full cluttered shelves down to 2 neatly tidy toy shelves and 3 empty, clean, ready for adult child's stuff shelves.

All in less time than a Christmas CD and with about as much stress as peeling a banana. Easy-peesy, away goes the stuff.

Posting mainly to remind myself that it really doesn't need to take a long time or lot of effort to get an area under control now, just because it USE to take me hours of time due to indecision, emotional baggage, etc.   I earned my proverbial black belt in decluttering and now I just need to use it.",declutter,1669494439.0

When decluttering feels like finally admitting it will never happen.,"I just found this sub from the hoarding sub and was debating where to post this before settling here. If this is not the right place to post this, I apologize in advance.

I eventually want to write a thorough account of my story, of how I got here, and all the parts that came together to make this issue what it is‚Ä¶ But for now I want to get this off my chest as it‚Äôs been weighing me down for some time. It‚Äôs been weighing on me ever since I realized it‚Äôs probably the reason I‚Äôve felt paralyzed to even start decluttering.

Decluttering feels like giving up. It feels like finally admitting to myself that this part of my life is gone, that it will never happen. Throwing away all my homework, my supplies, all the things I spent money on to pursue this career - throwing it all away means finally admitting that I failed. I failed to do what I wanted. I failed to get through college. I failed to prove that I could make a living for myself this way. And throwing all the supplies away also means that if I ever decided to try again, I‚Äôd have to spend so much money to re-accumulate all these supplies. Waste. It‚Äôs waste at this point, with how much room its taking up. But it‚Äôs also that all of it has gone to waste. Amounted to nothing. Wasted potential. Nothing to show for all of this waste.

I was only keeping them because I knew I spent a good amount of money on them. In less than 10 minutes, I had 3 people who wanted them!!

A ‚Äúlow-clutter‚Äù Christmas idea for those with kids,"Obviously, this depends on your kids ages and interests. Ours are teens and tweens and for the last several years, for their stockings I go to the local ethnic grocery stores or ethnic grocery aisle (Japanese, Indian and polish this year. Last year was Chinese, Scottish and Australian) and i buy them international candies, snacks and drinks.

It‚Äôs so much fun! Sometimes it ends up kind of terrible (I‚Äôm looking at you vegemite), sometimes awesome (Japan has a strong snack game), but it‚Äôs always fun and novel and silly.

And, the best part is, it‚Äôs really just grocery shopping. A bit of a pain to hit the multiple stores, but they like that I find them stuff and they say ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù And I say ‚ÄúI dunno, it‚Äôs not in English, eat it and see what happens‚Äù

It‚Äôs a ton of fun!

Enjoy the holidays friends and happy snacking!",declutter,1671758045.0
Toiletries Use It Up Challenge,"When my Christmas 2021 toiletry gifts (4 shower gels and a lotion) just did not fit in my bathroom cupboard, I was confused. I don‚Äôt wear loads of makeup, I‚Äôm not into palettes and all that. So why is my cupboard so full of stuff?! It was just full with products, almost all unopened. I had 8 shower gels (all gifts) from previous years! So my new year‚Äôs 2022 resolution was to do a Use It Up Challenge with a 1 in, 2 out goal.

The Rules

1. This challenge applies to all toiletry items brought into the bathroom, including makeup. 
2. But not dental products, they are too important. 
3. And not counting bar products (because they have no packaging to put in the bin!)
4. Items can be used up, donated or tossed.
5. All items (in and out) need to be written down, to maintain accountability. 

I brought in 22 items this year (including the 5 Christmas items from 2021), and got rid of 60 items! There is now enough space in my cabinet to store 3 toilet rolls. 

But other than the space, it has really changed my perspective on products. I used to buy items in the 3 for 2 sales, to stock up for future. But actually, it takes my about a year to use up 1 face moisturiser, or 1 serum. I really don‚Äôt need to stock up! I did slip up and buy 3 products in the summer, but soon realised I already have back ups of those. I felt annoyed at myself for wasting money, but also then for needing to get rid of 6 more items! 
Secondly, I realised which products I like (I‚Äôm a surprisingly big fan of serums), and which I don‚Äôt (gel-based cleansers). 
And it‚Äôs also encouraged me to make time for myself to use up some products. When people gift you toiletries, usually they are trying to gift you a pamper/relaxing experience. So take them up on it and fit in 5 minutes to use the product! 

Anyway, I actually found this a very manageable and non-wasteful way of decluttering bathroom products. It was surprisingly fun choosing which product to focus on next, and competing with myself not to buy new things, or trying to incorporate an extra product into my routine. So if this is you, give it a go in 2023! My goal will be 2 in, 3 out this year to maintain momentum - but I still have 3 shower gels left!",declutter,1671796613.0
Closet Declutter 2022 is complete! Learned a couple of things in the process.,"I have way too many pieces of clothing, and my husband wanted for me to declutter a bit, particularly because there's many pieces that I own, but he hasn't seen me wear in our 4+ years of living together. However, I'm one of those people who have a lot of emotional attachment to things and clothes, so it's hard for me to get rid of stuff.

We made a deal: I was gonna wear every piece of clothing during 2022 on my closet, and what didn't get worn, he could donate/get rid of. The only exception was party dresses as those don't get worn that often and I don't have that many. We kept a bag in the room that got donated every time it got full. When I worn an item, it would go to the back of the closet so that it was easy to see what I had worn and what I hadn't. 

Things I learned:

* You gotta let go, you won't fit into your high school jeans anymore: I'm in my 30s, I've been about the same weight thought my adult life but my body has changed. I have hips now, my ribcage has changed. Even if I can put the clothes on, that doesn't mean that the fit is right.

* Keep stuff you actually like to wear: It may fit, it may fit well, but that doesn't mean that you like it. I had a lot of stuff that was gifted or bought by my parents growing up. That's just not my style anymore, or it never was but I kept it out of... guilt? No point on keeping stuff that you don't actually like.

* The only way to truly realize if something fits, is to wear for a couple of hours, not just a short fit. There were things, specially pants, that I tried on and was like oh this is ok! And then I had a meal or moved around and realized that I can't really wear this for more than an hour or two, so why keep it?

* It will be sentimental to get rid of certain things, clothes with memories, clothes that you like but don't really fit in anymore. Taking pictures before donating them helped, as to keep the memory.

* You get to rediscover your closet: There's things I had forgotten about just because I often stuck with the same 5-10 outfits. Forcing myself to actually go through all my stuff made it so I had to be creative and had some fun through the process by putting together outfits that otherwise I would not have worn.

I wish I'd done a count at the beginning of the year to see how many things I cleared out, but it was definitely sizeable. I liked the system of actually going through the stuff, so things got decluttered with an actual reason, and not just at random.

The plan for 2023 is to do the same with the stuff in the dresser, shoes, accessories (belts, purses, hats), makeup and, jewelry. Only what gets used will be kept!

I would love to hear what kind of clothes declutter y'all did in 2022, and what you learned from the experience.",declutter,1671839381.0
Turned blackout lemons into decluttering lemonade!,"Due to the Christmas winter storm sweeping the country, we lost power for almost 48 hours.  The storm messed up our family's Christmas plans significantly.  But fortunately we have a wood stove to keep warm, lanterns and candles that provide sufficient light in the evenings, and temps were cold enough that we were able to put the fridge and freezer food outside in coolers to keep it from spoiling.  When we got our electricity and well water back about an hour ago, I figured it was the perfect opportunity to give the empty fridge and freezer a thorough cleaning, before putting all the food back in. In the process I threw out some expired items, and consolidated a few half-containers of the same stuff to make more room.

That freeing realization: I just don‚Äôt need it anymore!,"I just want to share a victory with you all:

Yesterday, I was talking with my partner about getting a stationary bike. He said, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have space! We‚Äôd need to get rid of something, like your desk and chair downstairs.‚Äù

In that moment, a switch flipped. I realized that the desk, which I bought in 2020 to support my pandemic work-from-home lifestyle, had only been useful to me for one year. The desk essentially had become a two-tiered crap shelf: craft tools, pictures, office supplies, and mail just sat there. I used the chair as a drying rack, LOL! I never sat at the desk with any regularity since that one year, and there will be zero chance I return to working from home, given the nature of my career.

I listed both items on CL at a steep discount (sunk costs, baby!) and both were scheduled for pickup this evening and tomorrow.

We decided to put the bike upstairs and move a reading chair downstairs to the desk space. I get to buy a side table, and turn it into a reading nook! 

This is huge for me. I have not been happy with how cluttered the downstairs has been for the past TWO YEARS, and I know that removing the dumping ground will force me to take office supplies to work, and take care of mail when it arrives‚Ä¶ and now I have a new cute little space to design. Oh, and I‚Äôll have the bike upstairs! The reason this all started.

Lesson learned: don‚Äôt hang on to things that no longer serve me or apply to my lifestyle! And price things at the rate I‚Äôd like to buy them for used.",declutter,1672616864.0
It doesn't matter if it's the easiest or most cost effective - gone is gone.,"I have adopted the above motto for my decluttering goals this year.

As I started cleaning things out this year, I quickly realized I was making pile after pile of things I was fine with getting rid of ... but each pile had a caveat.  So I worked hard but still physically had the piles around me - one needed to go to Goodwill, one needed to wait for heavy trash day, one needed to wait to be taken to Adult kid#1 home, etc.  Final pile was stuff for Adult kid #2 ... who lives across country from me.

I sighed and started the process of boxing the stuff up to hold onto until they visited again (they were just here but I forgot about this stuff).  And then something just snapped a little.

I want this stuff gone.  Keep the cheese, just let me out of the trap.

Went directly to the post office, got a shipping box, and loaded their stuff into it, returned to the post office and shipped it.   Dropped off the partial bag at Goodwill as I went (rather than waiting till it was full to ""not waste a bag"".  Dropped off the stuff at Adult kid #1 home too (even though I hadn't called first or waited till they were home).

I am just too nice sometimes. I try to do things too correctly sometimes.  If I want to make real progress I need to embrace the chaos of taking risks, ""wasting"" resources, and incurring a small amount of additional cost.

(FTR the large trash item I did hold onto but moved outside even though it doesn't look nice.  Will get rid of for free next Wed vs renting a truck to haul to the dump since that would be a big expense.  Still proud of me.)",declutter,1673185727.0
"This is probably super basic, but figuring it out unlocked a Whole New World in simply existing in my space.","I don‚Äôt know about y‚Äôall, but I came into decluttering thinking I needed to sort and purge whole categories of stuff: my closet, my bookshelf, the attic, all the home dec, all the random electronic cords. And, YES! All of that is valuable and necessary.

But! It doesn‚Äôt *really* change the way you exist in your space. The solution to tripping over your entire family‚Äôs shoe pile at the front door isn‚Äôt *really* to only give them two or three pairs of shoes (though it can help!). It‚Äôs to change the structures around *why* the shoes are there in the first place. For me, it was the basic infrastructure around my front door, the flow of how people move through that space, and the training involved in getting them to pick up after themselves.

I hired a professional organizer a year ago to help me ([previous posts here](https://old.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/pubgl8/im_hiring_a_professional_organizer_for_the_next/) and [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/pzl5gt/im_the_lady_hiring_the_professional_organizer/) 

And, through that process, I started to see that what I *actually* needed was to identify the spaces in my house that weren‚Äôt working for me, and tackle the *space* rather than the category. The Kitchen doesn‚Äôt need to be decluttered. I mean, it does, but that‚Äôs not my main problem. My main problem is that the kitchen is at the top of the basement stairs so it becomes a landing zone for anyone too lazy to run a screw driver or a basket of laundry downstairs, and I‚Äôm stuck cooking over top of it. The *counters* are making my life miserable. So, what‚Äôs on them, and more importantly: why?

Cuz, here‚Äôs the other thing I realized (and, again, this might be a ‚Äúduh‚Äù moment), everything that‚Äôs out is something that‚Äôs used and WON‚ÄôT BE DECLUTTERED ANYWAY!! It‚Äôs useless to clean out a cupboard if the windex lives on the counter. I need to figure out why the windex lives on the counter, and not the cupboard. Maybe it‚Äôs because the cupboard is full, but maybe it‚Äôs because the cupboard is a crappy place for the windex and no one remembers to put it away there. Maybe it needs to live under the sink (now that the youngest can be trusted not to drink household cleaners), or in a basket on the counter.

Also, some of it is accepting that the people in my house can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt change and adjusting my behavior, or even the processes behind my behavior to be easier on me, circumventing them. For example, my husband is notorious for leaving out his coffee supplies, even though I‚Äôve rearranged the kitchen (several times) to make it easier on him. So I bought a coffeemaker with a timer and now when I clean the kitchen each day, *I* make his coffee for the next day, set the timer, and put everything away. (Theoretically, it would suck, but I find in some ways my husband is less trainable out of his habits than our children or even myself is, so I pick my battles. And we‚Äôre less nagging-wife/man-child-husband-dynamic, and more partnership, since he reciprocates in ways I feel are equivalent.) Now the coffee stuff is where *I* find it most convenient. No decluttering was necessary for any of that, because I found my solution in analyzing the flow of the space, how people interact within the space, and the physical infrastructure necessary to affect them.

Last week, I set a soft, tall braided basket at the top of the stairs to catch all the stuff that needed to go downstairs so it wasn‚Äôt on the counter or underfoot. The cat looooooves it and sleeps in it when it‚Äôs empty. Do you know who noticed the basket was too full for the cat to sleep in and voluntarily ran the stuff downstairs to empty it for him? The person who put the crap that needed to go downstairs on my counter in the first place‚Ä¶ less than a half hour prior.

Mmmwha-ha-ha-ha!

Anyway! Yes! Declutter and continue to declutter, but rather than devoting all your energy on (like me) a KonMari method, or emptying out storage bins you only access a few times a year, write down the spaces that stress you out (specifically, *which* corner, *which* table), and start to look at those spaces THEMSELVES and use decluttering as one tool of many you can use.

A cat tax has been requested! Unfortunately, I have not yet caught him in the basket and taken a pic of it. If I get one, I‚Äôll update again! To tide y‚Äôall over, I have previous posts of my creamsicle I‚Äôll link!

"Dropped off a full car of donations today, then promptly broke into tears.","Forgive what is likely seemingly like a click bait title, I sat here for five minutes trying to think of how to concisely title this post / my feelings and had nothing. 

I spent the past week or so massively decluttering. It started with taking the Christmas decor down and I used that as momentum to go through other spaces. I‚Äôm so done with having so much stuff. It deeply overwhelms me. I made serious progress and filled my car completely. 

Including a dog bed and a giant squishmallow that my late dog used. She passed suddenly over the summer and I‚Äôve left them there ever since. Partly because I couldn‚Äôt bare to get rid of them, and partly because I hoped our other dogs would use the space but they don‚Äôt go into the room they‚Äôre in. 

I understood they weren‚Äôt being used. I know it‚Äôs been months without her. I knew I‚Äôd never use such a giant squishmallow. I thought it was totally fine until I handed the stuffed animal off to the attendant at the store and he made a comment and I explained it was my late dogs. When I was done, I got in the car pulled into a spot and balled my eyes out. I know I couldn‚Äôt just keep it there forever. But it breaks my heart and it honestly made me feel so rude disposing of her things in this way. (A feeling I‚Äôve never had when letting go of a late family members things‚Ä¶not sure what that says about me but I digress‚Ä¶) like it was a betrayal. 

Anyway, I mostly wanted to vent because I can‚Äôt really talk about this with anyone and it‚Äôs just been looming over me like a cloud all day.

I finally cleaned my room. Feels good to breathe,"Me and my family jokingly say I'm at the beginning stages of hoarding, but I'm afraid of that actually happening in the future. 

I spent 5 hours cleaning and I got 3 trash bags worth of junk gone. Trash bag worth of recyclable stuff gone, and about a trash bag worth I'm giving away on Facebook. 

I finally let go of all the stuff I ""might need one day"", half finished projects, stuff I bought and didn't even end up using or needing. If this stuff was gone years ago I'd of forgotten all about it. It's crazy how much money I wasted on a temporary happiness from buying it. So many small things that added up to being a giant pile. I had little things stacked on top of big things, phone boxes going back to high school, stuff I took apart to restore and forgot about, all gone. 

My motivation was every time I found something I hadn't used or seen in years I told myself it had to go, unless it was truly sentimental or something I needed and lost. Thankfully there wasn't many instances of that. 

Happy to see this all go out finally. I already forget what's in the bags and hope to add more later!  https://imgur.com/a/YMCG17O",declutter,1673442926.0

(Success and VENT) Decluttering and giving things a home is finally paying off but damn...,"I moved into a home 14 years ago with my then-partner and his mother. I came in with very few items and we had a baby. Years later his mother moved out leaving tons behind, also his brother had stored many things as he lived in an apartment in the city. Not even a year and a half after his mother moved out she moved back in due to health reasons and brought everything plus an apartment worth of new stuff with her. I had barely touched moving things around when this happened and only a few months later she passed away, at the same time I found out I was pregnant with our second child. I never felt like this house was mine in any way as it was full of family heirlooms, furniture their father built, grandma's kitchen table, and now everything his mother owned. I made due as I was pregnant and dealing with her passing and before you knew it our second child is here.

I had been doing small purges of draws and bins, always asking my (ex) partner what he could part with, and sometimes it could be a lot other times nothing. It has been 6yrs since his mother passed away. In the last two years, I have worked hard on redoing the bedrooms moving my kids upstairs, and pairing down items. Purging and purging and purging. I had to let go of items I just hadn't touched in years and teach my children how to as well. Their father is a borderline hoarder and in the last two years, he has come to notice how the clutter is taking away from his quality of life. He has finally started parting ways with family items that he never touched but took up tons of space in our home. We always ask other family members if they want it first.

The crazy thing is we actually broke up last year and due to life and expenses and children, we can't actually move out of the house. So we now live separately in the same house. I just finished cleaning out a closet in the living room and donating 4 more bags of unneeded items. Last week we donated 7 bags of items. I even have a room set up right now to just organize and declutter the 3 rooms of toys we had going. It is the last major declutter I have to do before I feel done, for now. I feel like for the first time ever this place equally represents the people that live here and things have a place to go, things are where you need them and everyone has their own space for their personal items. The rooms are no longer stacked and cluttered, the drawers all open and you can see what is in the closets.

"STUFF DECLUTTERED, STILL STRESSED?","Look at your obligations. Back in 2005 when I started my declutter journey, I was about 40, three kids, house, husband, dog, 2 cats, 8 million fish, 5 birds and I was overwhelmed to the max.

We began to downsize our stuff, but I couldn't figure out why I was so tired. So one day I decided to map my life.  I sat down with Outlook, which was my calendar of choice, and I began to map out everything I did in a days time. I started with the kid's schedules, sports, church, scouts... and then added in chores, dishes, laundry, carpool... then added in sleep, eat, etc.

It took me most of a Saturday to map out every obligation my family and I had.  I figured in every 24 hour period, I needed to work about 72 hours to stay caught up. My children needed to work about 48-60 hours a day to stay caught up.  Hubby was working about 60 hours a day to stay caught up!

No wonder young family's are so tired. Every time the sun went around the earth, my family had to do nearly 3 days of work!

So with it all mapped out, I started looking at what things didn't bring me joy.  Started with scouting. While I had loved it as a kid and it was my only extracurricular activity, my kids were pretty blas√© about it and as the leader, I not only had to be at the meeting, but I also had to prepare for it, and also have a semi presentable house for the meetings. I resigned effective the end of that school year, which thankfully was within a few weeks.  I then worked my way through everything on the list and tried to remove anything that I didn't enjoy doing or the kids didn't enjoy doing. Sure we still had to do laundry, but we could get rid of other things.

When I was finally done, each kid was allowed on extracurricular activity per school year. With three kids, that's still a lot.  But something I noticed started happening:

On that night we used to do girl scouts, we began having family time. We could watch tv or play a game, or just hang out.  The kids started being less stressed. The house stayed cleaner as more stuff went out the door and I began to feel less overwhelmed.  As I removed things from the calendar that we no longer did, there were open spaces for us to chill, learn a new skill, eat dinner together instead of at the ball field.

It may not be stuff that is stressing you out. It may be obligations. These days, kids are grown. I work full time from home, so I can clean during what used to be my commute time.  But I have learned to not allow meetings and obligations fill up my schedule.",declutter,1673972106.0
Storage Unit & Shame,"I‚Äôm posting this as a warning, advice, insight‚Äîwhatever. I escaped an abusive marriage (23 yes worth) at 40.

That turned into 20 years‚Äîmy re-marriage & storing more ‚Äústuff‚Äù‚Äîsince I conveniently had a storage unit. 20 FUCKING YEARS.

Anyone else struggle with the donation drop off task?,"I'm actually doing pretty well with sorting out what to keep vs what to get rid of. My problem is I'll have boxes of donations that just sit there for weeks. I've tried putting them in the car, but they'll sit there for weeks as well.

The problem is my local thrift shops have very specific hours and days they accept donations (10am to 1pm, then 2pm to 4pm for my local Goodwill for example) and then sometimes they don't have workers to accept donations even during those specific hours, so I find myself avoiding the chore. 

When I have boxes and bags piling up I slow down on decluttering.

Decluttering snowball,"A therapist once told me we overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate what we can do in a year. I did a massive effort to get rid of 18 bags of clutter and trash (and counting) from the kitchen. As a result I‚Äôve been cooking somewhat regularly. Then I cleaned up the master bed by putting away much of the piles of clothes into proper homes (thank you store that sells containers) and shifting the rest to the laundry. Not the ideal solution but a remarry space. After two weeks of sleeping in a clean organized bed, I sat around yesterday thinking that there is manageable bulk on the floor now - it‚Äôs not knee high just lots of strewn around paper mostly looking for a home. I put away the case of water blocking access to the front closet because I suddenly realized I had a home for it. I can finally get into the front closet to hang our jackets. Which will help debulk the floor some more. So it‚Äôs been a domino effect. As my senses stop being overwhelmed, there‚Äôs more piles of stuff I‚Äôm able to debulk and more piles I can make from the random stuff for future organizing. I still don‚Äôt have clear surfaces. Each time I clear a surface I find stuff lying around to put on it. Having a clear surface feels like a lie. Even having a clear bed feels like a lie so I haven‚Äôt been making it.Now that I‚Äôve said it aloud‚Ä¶I think I‚Äôm going to get my brain used to a clean bed by making it everyday.",declutter,1675246282.0
getting rid of an ex‚Äôs things i didn‚Äôt know i had.,"this has to have a warning with it: my ex died in 2019 and was abusive so this post involves themes that go along with that kind of experience. this post is also long.

i‚Äôve (27NB) been on a decluttering journey for almost a year now and i‚Äôve held onto my ex‚Äôs stuff without truly realizing it since we broke up in 2018. our relationship lasted for 5 years, was tumultuous at best, and i got out of it for my own safety, which ended with her being kicked out of my apartment. she was so resistant that i had to take it upon myself to pack her stuff for her because she refused to do it. it was almost an impossible task in itself because she was a compulsive spender and had a LOT of stuff.

anyway, without going too much into the nitty gritty, her moving out was awful and it ended up with some of her things being left behind (though i didn‚Äôt realize it at the time). some of these things included art supplies that i decided to keep. the only things she ever asked for back that i forgot to send with her were two totes of decorations, which i then gave to her. the rest she said she didn‚Äôt care about.

and then she died a year later, and it was one of the most emotionally difficult weekends of my life. i‚Äôve done a lot of work on myself since then, and i thought that i was doing pretty well.

so coming back to the present, i‚Äôve had these art supplies along with some other things for years now. i‚Äôm an artsy person, so i figured i could use some extra paints and things. well, as you could probably guess, i never used them because i‚Äôm more of an acrylics and watercolors person while she used fabric paint, oils, etc. i finally decided to get rid of them.

it felt good to let go of what felt like a piece of her that i had unintentionally been keeping in my house for years. and then i looked around and realized that there are other things of hers that i didn‚Äôt know consciously that i had. decorative items, dvds, kitchen gadgets‚Ä¶ so many things. suddenly i was surrounded by reminders of the worst 5 years of my life. i couldn‚Äôt believe that i had looked over so many of them for so long. healing is funny that way.

so i‚Äôve been ruthlessly looking through my things and getting rid of stuff that came from her. i don‚Äôt care what it is, it‚Äôs getting donated or trashed. most of it i would have gotten rid of anyway, like dvds i don‚Äôt watch and products i just don‚Äôt use but thought i would. it‚Äôs been hard, and emotional, and enlightening and freeing. so many things are being released from my life, my home, and my conscience. i did it, i‚Äôm doing it, and soon i‚Äôll be done with it.

if you read this whole thing then thank you, i appreciate this community a lot and i‚Äôm happy to have somewhere to talk about these kinds of successes no matter how hard they are. :)",declutter,1675459267.0
TIP- To Identify Those Random Things You Keep Saving But Have No Idea What They Are,"TLDR On Google, in the search bar there is an icon of a camera. Click on it. Hold your phone over the item.  Click the shutter button to search. It's very freeing

I use this to identify random unknown items that I find and keep putting away because I have no idea if it's important or not. Most of the time it is not. For years, I kept finding a brass filter I thought was for a car. It looked very important. I was not going to throw it away.  Then since discovering Google Lens, I decided once and for all to figure out what it was. It was an oil burner nozzle. A service man must have dropped it years ago and it looked important enough for us to save it. Out it went.

I had replied to another thread about Cables and  that I use it to identify some cables. I found one cable with the end that you plug in the device to be different that the current micro-USBs . Google Lens told me it is a Motorola cable. Knowing we haven't had a Motorola phone in many years, I knew I could toss it. It worked with other cables as well, but not all.

Play around with it.  It is fun, easy to use and so helpful in decluttering, especially if you have a fear of throwing out potentially important items. Most of the time, you'll discover they are not!",declutter,1675688460.0
PSA about Facebook marketplace,"This is not really a typical post for this sub but hopefully it's allowed -- I just wanted to share because I've recently finally started decluttering my house and getting rid of a lot of items that we no longer need. I started listing things on FB marketplace yesterday. And now, TWICE in two days, I've been contacted by people who asked to send payment by Zelle -- before even coming to get the item, first red flag -- and then I get an email saying my ""account is under limit"" and I need to ""create a Zelle business account"" for which I need to pay a few hundred dollars. Then they say they'll send me that money but I need to send it back.

Of course as someone who grew up in the internet age, this made all my spidey senses tingle and I googled it and it was a known scam https://www.gobankingrates.com/banking/mobile/zelle-scams-facebook-marketplace/ but I just want to let y'all know to be wary of this shit because a lot of people are scumbags apparently.",declutter,1675739537.0
I wish I had someone to distract me while I attack my living room,"I once had a friend (if you can believe that) who was one the phone with me for 6 hours while I cleaned my house. Mind you, this was at the height of the panny and times were a bit different. 

As time went on, we would be on the phone for hours (maybe not 6) just talking about any and everything which would keep my mind occupied enough while I moseyed around cleaning. 

I now realize how great that was because I just got the items I ordered from Amazon with the past week and I swear everything came in oversized, cumbersome boxes. I‚Äôve unboxed many things, but I need to organize stuff and breakdown the boxes. 

Unfortunately, every time I go in there to get started, I get hit with a huge wave of overwhelm and retreat to my room, which is BARELY cluttered at all. 

Just wanted to vent. Thanks.",declutter,1676114984.0
I can't hire a cleaner because my house is too messy," 

I qualify for paid house cleaning as part of my job (up to 4 hours per week, paid for by my employer).

But I feel like I can't use it as my house as too messy! Let me give you some examples:

\- vacuuming - the floor is covered with toys and my daughter goes mad if I try to move them as they are all in a special set-up.

\- changing the bed sheets etc - the sheets are all in random places and would be hard for the cleaner to find. Plus my kids beds always have tons of toys covering them.

\- doing the laundry - it's cramped and hard to reach the washing machine

\- cleaning the kitchen - the bench is covered with things like appliances and papers, and I would like them to wash and put away the dishes, but how would they know where to put them?

\- cleaning the bathroom - it's so chaotic - sure, they could clean the bath and the sink, but the towels and things are crammed in everywhere. There are stacked up cardboard boxes of nappies, etc.

\- I could use the cleaner money to pay someone to cook for us, but my kitchen is so chaotic I would be ashamed to try to show them where the food is.

I don't even know what chores the cleaner should do. As you can see, I've never hired a cleaner before.

I feel like getting the house ready for the cleaner would be so much it effort, it would be dreadful. I definitely don't want to spend hundreds of hours decluttering right now. At the same time, I REALLY want to have the house cleaned.",declutter,1676244180.0

"We finally have a spot for the ‚Äòtoo clean to wash, too dirty to put back in the drawer‚Äô clothes","Like many, my husband and I have struggled to know what to do with clothes that are worn multiple times before washing. For years we have used ‚Äúthe chair‚Äù or piled them on top of the dresser. In general we keep our spaces pretty clutter-free, so the piles of semi-clean clothes have always driven me nuts. 

Part of our problem stemmed from us sharing one big dresser since we moved in together. It had big, deep drawers that were stuffed to capacity and difficult to keep organized. We finally decided to get two dressers, one for each of us. While setting them up, my husband had a simple yet truly life changing idea - the top drawer of his dresser would be solely dedicated to the clothes he wears multiple times before washing. I did the same and, my goodness, it is incredible how much of a difference having a designated spot for those clothes has been. I am still breaking the habit of throwing my clothes on the chair or the corner of the bed, but now I catch myself and can tidy up in 5 seconds. 

As a bonus, transferring clothes from our old dresser to the new dressers provided an excellent opportunity to reevaluate and get rid of clothing we don‚Äôt use. We both probably decluttered about a third of the clothes we had in our old dresser. 

I keep telling my husband that, after marrying me, this is the best idea he has ever had. I have told pretty much everyone in my life about this, and I just had to share with this lovely community!",declutter,1676554043.0
"Has anyone needed to declutter their life of hobbies/responsibilities, not just their belongings?","In the last few months, I have forgotten really important things in my life (canceling subs I don't use anymore, renewing things that need to be renewed, assignments that are due, etc), and I've come to realize it's because I have too much going on in my brain.

"I decluttered 14,000 digital items within a few hours. Here's how I did it.","Tips:

1. You have way more duplicates than you think you do
2. Start small, set a small goal - 100 items, 1000 items, whatever works for you. Then, once you have the momentum, decide if you'd like to continue from there
3. You do not need 15 shots of the same tree at slightly different angles, just one is fine (calling myself out here)
4. Your mass dumping of photos means that you do not enjoy them, you do not look at them, because it is overwhelming. Yes, many are pretty, but you cannot enjoy them when you're overwhelmed
5. More photos of a memory does not equate to stronger memory, especially if they're at the same place, pose, or people
6. Take many breaks, drink water or tea, don‚Äôt forget to eat
7. Don‚Äôt strive for perfect (again, calling myself out here)
8. If you get stuck on something, move on. You can go back to it later.

How I did it:

1. Gather like-items into folders. Start with 1 folder, maybe even the ""documents"" general folder.
2. Skim the files, note the major groupings you can do - DO NOT BE SPECIFIC HERE - just organize them by overall topic (in my case I'm a recent graduate, so I organized my notes by class), I also organized my important money/legal docs into an overall ""legals and financials"" folder
3. Put them into the folders as best you can, if you note that one could fit in more than 1 folder just put it in one, whichever you thought of first: that'll be the one you check first if you ever need the file
4. Create another folder called ""misc"" for files that don't really fit in any particular group
5. Now that you have the overall folders choose one, and go look at the documents - again, just skim them
   1. Let's go with the school notes example.
      1. Do you intend to go to grad school? Would you like to keep that door open? If so, then you should save your assignments. Create a separate folder within the folder for these. Right now you are NOT choosing which your favorites are - you're just saving them into a sub-folder from the class. You can go through them later, if you wish
      2. You do not need your school notes - all those notes from ""week 1"" ""week 2"" were created for the course itself - which you have now completed. If you are done with your degree you will not look back on them again - those can be safely discarded
      3. You may or may not need your syllabus, if you choose to return to school later. HOWEVER you only need one copy - save whichever has the most recent date on the file, and discard the rest
6. For items like tax documents, etc. you should create separate folders and divide by year - this can be done in multiple trips if you wish, as it is tedious
   1. You can open each document to view the year, OR you can right-click and click ""file info"" - this will reveal the date it was downloaded, and if you've downloaded documents each time you filed then that date should line up with the year
   2. For contracts signed, terms and conditions, etc. these should be put in a separate sub-folder for each - again, general grouping.
   3. If you signed documents for your employer create a folder for that job, and place them in it
7. Create another folder for general terms and conditions
8. Create another folder for product warranty info, etc.

Music

1. Music downloads are harder because they often do not have a photo, you may not even remember the songs.
2. Start with the albums you remember ‚Äì do you have any albums you don‚Äôt listen to at all? Or any you vaguely dislike? Or any you were disappointed by? Get rid of them ‚Äì you can always find them on Youtube or another streaming service if you wish to listen to them later (you won‚Äôt).
3. Now, are there any albums you bought that have songs within them you don‚Äôt like? Go get rid of those songs
4. Are there albums or songs you don‚Äôt remember? Go listen to them ‚Äì maybe have them as background music as you declutter, clean, etc. ‚Äì and decide if you like them. If you find yourself skipping any songs delete them as you skip them

Now, onto the photos

1. I put this last because it's the hardest for many people, if you'd like to stop at files, music, or even part way through any step I encourage it. Stop now and then through photos if you start to feel anxious, off, or like things are too much: be kind to yourself.
2. How many folders do you have with similar name? Go click on those, and skim the photos - be sure to have the viewing option so that it shows you a small photo as you scroll through.
   1. Do the photos in each folder seem to be the same? Or are they from the same general time period? If so go to one of the duplicate folders, doesn't matter which, and select all photos. Copy them, and go to the other folder to paste them
   2. There will be a popup at some point asking what to do with files that are already in the folder, for that click ""skip those files"" - any files that are not in the folder will be added, and you will avoid duplicates.
   3. Go back, and delete the old folder
3. Now, go back to the main ‚Äúpictures‚Äù folder. How many loose photos do you have? Like the files, we‚Äôre going to group those into general folders.
   1. Once again be sure the viewing option shows the photos
   2. There are a few ways you can go about this
      1. Group the photos by person in them
      2. Group the photos by event
      3. Group the photos by year
   3. Create the general folder for whichever method you choose. Personally I did it by year. You can create a sub-folder for the event or person within the year folder if you wish
   4. Again, create a ‚Äúmisc‚Äù folder for any photos that don‚Äôt fit in any of the categories (due to unknown year, unknown person, etc.)
   5. As you go through these steps you may note photos you dislike, people you dislike, or duplicates ‚Äì you can delete these as you go if you wish, but do not get hung up on them
4. Once you have organized the photos into general folders choose one and go through it, as you did with the files ‚Äì skim them, do not view each individually.
   1. Do the first pass-through as a general overview, there is no need to be detailed ‚Äì we are just removing stuff that jumps out at us
   2. How many photos of the same tree/person/etc. do you have that are the exact same but slightly different angles? Pick one, get rid of the rest of the duplicates
   3. Are there any photos that immediately leave a bad taste in your mouth or make you feel uncomfortable? Get rid of them
   4. Are there any photos you do not want but you‚Äôre keeping because you think someone else will want them? Send them by email, text, whatever now. Then, delete them.
   5. Are there photos you want and think someone else would like to have? Copy them into an email and, send them to them now ‚Äì if there‚Äôs duplicates after sending the photos delete those and keep a few, you know you have access to them through the other person if you really want one of the other duplicates (you won‚Äôt).
5. Move onto another folder, do the same ‚Äì remember this is just the first pass-through, do not fixate on being perfect. If you cannot choose which photo of a duplicate to keep move on ‚Äì you can come back to it later.
6. After you go through each picture folder as a general pass you can do so again, once again just looking for what jumps out at us.
7. Like physical clutter each time you go through you will notice more items that can go

When you feel like you are done for the day, would like to stop, or know you must go to work/put kids to bed/make dinner take a minute to close all the tabs, and go to the recycle bin.

* Watch the number of files in there build as they load, and feel the weight of each of those files on yourself, on your shoulders, on your heart. How many gigabites is it? How much space? There is no need to find out.
* Picture those thousands of items as a physical pile, as clutter on your surfaces and your heart, take a breath, then empty the recycle bin
* As you watch the number of items in the bin decrease picture that physical pile getting smaller and smaller, your surfaces clearing rapidly
* When the number hits zero pause, exhale, and picture the weight you felt before lifting off of you as you release your breath.

Feel how light you are, and picture that horrible physical pile in your mind being cleared. Your shoulders no longer carry that weight. You did it. All those items are gone. You did it.

Remember the feeling of lightness, close your computer (after safely ejecting any USB or external harddrive you may have plugged in), and reconnect with your heart, that now no longer has that weight on it.

You may come back and do this as many times as you wish throughout your life, there is no right or wrong way to do this.

Always remember to be kind with yourself, don't forget to drink water and be sure to have something to eat.

"I‚Äôve both embraced, and let go of, my fantasy self","I posted a while ago about how I‚Äôve embraced my fantasy self and started wearing the dresses I‚Äôd had, but not worn, for so long. Well, I‚Äôm still wearing them - I even wore the 50‚Äôs rockabilly to work, complete with net petticoat, because it was Christmas and why not!
This has meant that I‚Äôve decluttered all of my previous ‚Äòwork‚Äô outfits that made me feel frumpy and didn‚Äôt even look as smart as I thought they would. Fantasy me has become real me.

However, I‚Äôve also let go of my ‚Äòfantasy self‚Äô in other areas of my decluttering journey. I‚Äôve accepted that as much as I thought I‚Äôd bake cakes and cookies, or make dinners from scratch like I used to, new me doesn‚Äôt have the time, or the inclination, to spend hours in the kitchen. I‚Äôm not lazy, I‚Äôve just embarked on a new path in life and that path doesn‚Äôt leave me much time or energy to rustle up a sponge or dozens of chocolate chip cookies. So I‚Äôve cleared my cupboards of all the cake tins, cookie cutters, baking sheets and mixing bowls I‚Äôd been storing. My niece IS a keen baker and has been the grateful recipient of much of it, the rest has either been donated or thrown depending on condition. 

I feel so much lighter. My cupboards no longer taunt me and now I have room to rearrange the things I do use in a more accessible way. So no more kneeling on the floor (my knees aren‚Äôt as young as they were) to reach into the back for a jug. I‚Äôve kept one loaf tin, with liners, because I do occasionally make a low-sugar chocolate loaf cake that is to die for.

I highly recommend doing the same. If you‚Äôve somewhere in your house that holds items for that hobby you were *totally going to do* but never had the time for and now it makes you feel guilty, don‚Äôt be afraid to take those things and bid them a fond farewell. Find a local hobby group that will use that yarn, a relative who finds it relaxing to make delicious cakes, or ask the local school if they want any art equipment. Or just burn it all in an act of catharsis. Whatever works for you. Just don‚Äôt keep anything that makes you feel unnecessary guilt or shame.

The benefit of unnecessary time on Zillow.,"My husband would like us to theoretically buy a bigger house in about 2 years. Needless to say, he's been on Zillow nonstop, sending me houses we are in no way prepared to buy. I've tried to get him to stop, because it's creating stress for no reason, but eventually learned to just tune it out. And then of course the perfect house in the perfect spot showed up. There was no way we were going to get it, but this inspired a flurry of ""if we could get our house ready to sell ASAP..."" I used every declutter trick I could, I even cleared out the medicine cabinet muttering ""if I can replace it in 20 minutes for less than $20..."" I carried a changing table down a spiral staircase and out the door by myself, I sorted out stuff from all my hard spots, I helped him with his closet and clothes, and all told, we got rid of 2 full curbside bins of recycling, 4 bags of trash, 2 bags of clothing to textile recycling, 4 bags of clothing to the thrift store, 5 bags of stuff to Goodwill, 2 pieces of baby furniture. We saw the house on Saturday and while it was perfect for us, it was also perfect for the 10 other people who put in offers, so, that dream is dashed. But, our house looks great, the kitchen feels nicer to be in, I'm really proud of how hard I worked to get rid of things I was attached to, and I'm in awe at the sheer poundage of \*crap\* we ""needed"" until we needed to decide what was worth storing or packing.",declutter,1677613174.0
I got rid of 3 large garbage bags of clothes today! üéâ,"Just sharing a little victory for myself. When I say I got rid of them I mean I actually drove them to a place and donated them. They're gone from my house. These bags have been sitting in my house for months bc I've just had a hard time getting the last step done of actually physically getting rid of them. But it was maternity clothes and a bunch of baby clothes so I couldn't bear to throw them away if someone might need them. I also dropped off 3 nursing pillows (definitely didn't ever need 3 to begin with lol).

Whew getting rid of baby stuff is liberating bc I had my final baby 6mo ago. And I am drowning in baby stuff bc I have people in my life who have given me their hand me downs, which has been useful but also excessive. I've been struggling with my executive functioning since having my baby so taking this step to finally donate some excess stuff felt like a big victory.

I came up with a morning and a night routine and it was a game changer.,"I was reading Marla Cilley's Sink Reflections and she talks a lot about routines.  She recommends a Control Journal to keep track of daily/weekly chores, menu planning, to-do lists, etc.  Sort of like a pre-bullet journal.

I decided to formalize my before bed and morning routines - I'm just starting out with bullet journaling so I got a graph paper notebook and made my lists.

I've got about a dozen little tasks I can do while my husband is taking his shower before bed.  I tidy up the living room, fold the sofa blanket, fluff the throw pillows, and put the remote next to the TV.  In the kitchen, I make sure the sink dishes are washed, load and run the dishwasher, wipe down the counters and stove top, tidy the kitchen table, get any fingerprints off the fridge and vent hood, lay out a clean dish towel.  Then I check our calendar and the weather forecast, prep my gym bag, and make a quick to-do list.  I also put a couple of denture tabs into the downstairs toilet because we have really hard water.  It all takes about 15 minutes and I'm usually done by the time my husband is getting out of the shower - then I take my shower and go to bed.

I tell my myself I'm trying to be kind to morning me.  

In the morning, I hang up our pajamas, make sure the laundry made it into the laundry basket, and make the bed.  The kitchen in nice and tidy from the night before so while breakfast is cooking, all I have to do is empty the dish drainer and unload the dishwasher.

Since I have a formalized list, I find myself doing things right away - I know I have to do it anyway so if I have a couple of minutes while the kettle is boiling for some Sleepy Time tea, why not tidy up the kitchen table or clear out the sink?  I'm more aware of what I want the house to look like before I go to bed so I'm less likely to forget or put things off.  It only takes a couple of minutes and it really is much kinder.

I have a cleaning day and a laundry day so I made a weekly cleaning list.  Since I'm tidying better, I can get almost everything done that I want to get done, but if not, I can see what I skipped and pick it up later in the week.

I'm still trying to figure out how to schedule and track monthly, quarterly, bi-annual, and annual chores but so far, so good.",declutter,1678762706.0

Small victory,"I can't tell anyone IRL because that's admitting how awful my house is... 

I cleaned the bathroom sink! 

Such a small thing, but after months of watching it get more & more dirty I finally did something & I'm happy with the outcome.  

Motivation was that I bought the new Dawn platinum powerwash dish spray & wanted to give it a try on other grunge.  Sprayed it on, let it sit a few minutes, and wiped with a wet sponge. 

Until the kitchen sink is cleared out enough to wash dishes there, I'm using the bathroom sink.

Purging my fabric stash. Deterioration of items stored too long is definitely a thing.,"I decided that all of my sewing stuff has to fit in my sewing room and no more bins - every thing has to fit into drawers (Ladybug here).  It's a tiny room with an awkward dormer ceiling but it needs to be functional so that means enough space to accommodate my cabineted sewing machine, ironing board, and a (gate-leg) work table.

Tools were easy, I went through everything and kept the one I liked the best - even if that meant getting rid of the cool old vintage one :(  But life's too short to dig through a drawer of multiples trying the find the one I want.  Ditto hand sewing needles - I've been using the same needles in the same needle case for decades - if I lose one, I find it because I don't want it tearing up my furniture, scratching the floor, or stepping on it.  And so many packages of sewing pins - what am I keeping them for (besides the pretty glass heads)?

But I dreaded going through my fabric stash.  I've curated it so many times over the years - down to the ""really good stuff"" - but I still had bins and bins and bins of fabric.

It's actually been less painful than I expected.  Sort of like when I went through my clothes closet.  Any young or ""skanky"" fabric, gone.  Any muddy colors, gone.  Any colors that don't look good on me, gone.  If I can't fit it into a capsule wardrobe, gone.  Past-life fabric (so much suiting fabric), gone.  Ridiculous fantasy-life fabric (all that thai silk), gone.  

Even if I had a closet-full of Law and Order ADA power suits, I would never wear them.  And I'm not planning to drive 3-5 hours to go to the Opera.  And I missed my chance for tea with the Queen.  Where we live now, a clean shirt is pretty much dressing up - a knit dress is almost prom-worthy.  At this point, I'm more Steve Jobs, less Diane Von Fusterberg.  And most of my sewing is home dec anymore.

But the devastating thing, despite my best efforts - most of the gorgeous raw silk I lugged back from Vietnam in 1996 (I had to buy a second suitcase and pay an overweight fee!) - huge patches of sun fading!  Some of it is salvageable, but what a waste!  And I'm sure there will be others, once I open up the yardage to photograph.

I called my friend who makes beautiful couture clothing and we talked about fabric stashes.  We both have fabric squirreled away that we've had for decades - some of it inherited from our mothers!  And we've both worked around faded fold lines, more than once.  

We decided that unless we have an actual project planned, we're letting it go.  If we've got something we really like - let's figure out something to do with it now!  Even if that's just a TV cover (here's looking at you adorable ramen-bowl cat fabric).

It's better to spend a bit more on something ""fresh"" than lose something to time, sun, damp, mice, moths, etc.  You can make (and use) something now that may deteriorate in however many years, or you can hold onto materials that still deteriorate in however many years and have to throw them out, unused.

Besides, most of the fabric, I didn't even remember I had it!  Would I buy it again?  No.",declutter,1679327490.0

Cleaning for you vs cleaning for guests,"One thing I‚Äôve really worked towards is a home that is not only clean enough for guests, but just for the ones who live here to enjoy.
We tend to think our homes needs to be cleaned for guests better than we keep it for ourselves. But don‚Äôt we deserve a home to be proud of, to enjoy, or just to feel relaxed in?
Do you spend more time cleaning for guests over cleaning for your family?
I know some things I never cleaned unless we were having company. Toys were left out for several days unless there was food or trash mixed in. And I usually change sheets for overnight guests. Plus bathrooms can always use a clean with kids. But I am talking house in general. 
Granted when kids a little, no matter how much we clean, there‚Äôs always a mess. :)
But to me, the point of decluttering and organizing is to make our homes easier to care for. To create less chaos. To give us a home guest ready. To give us a peaceful place to come home to, and yet still be a place we can enjoy.

8 boxes of stuff GONE after a breakup,"Just want to share a victory.

I've been decluttering since the pandemic but because I cycle/walk everywhere, getting it out of the house has been a problem. I did donate tons of clothes at a collection bin near my house (one load at a time on my bike üòñ) but the tchotchkes and housewares were an issue.

Decided to finally tackle it for good and did an aggressive sweep of the house in February. I'm still healing from the breakup of a 12 year relationship and finally got to a place where I felt good getting rid of some of the mementos and other stuff that he'd given me or that reminded me of that time in my life. I was BRUTAL in my liberation of stuff. I did another pass of the house, gathered a lot of ""maybe I'll fit into this again"" clothes, shoes I hardly wore and never really liked but didn't want to get rid of because they were expensive, you all know the drill. Y'all. SO. MUCH. STUFF.

I only donated things that were something someone would want or could use. Grungy old clothes went in the trash as did anything broken or really beat up. I threw in a few really nice, valuable things like a Garmin watch that I'd replaced with a better model as a kind of thank you to the thrift store for helping me free myself from this stuff. I did not donate to Goodwill, I chose a thrift store in my city that directly supports our LGBT community.

Then I got on Taskrabbit to arrange someone to take the stuff to the thrift store and today was the day. As I shlepped the boxes to her car I felt zero regret. I felt only relief, like THANK GOD these boxes that have been piling up in my living room for weeks are finally gone. I can't even remember what the hell was in most of the boxes. I know I won't miss any of it. Totally recommend Taskrabbit btw! It's awesome.

It's ok to put things in the trash... especially trash,"https://good360.org/blog-posts/avoiding-the-second-disaster-how-not-to-donate-during-a-crisis/

Just wanted to post this here as I know many people on this reddit like to donate used items or assume there is some ""other"" person who will fix their broken items or appreciate their single shoe.  If you don't see a value in it, a complete stranger is unlikely to.  Please don't send objects to support natural disasters or crisis centers.  There are countries in Africa currently deluged with our ""charity"".  Yes there is always a theoretical ""someone who could use this!"" but you don't need to hoard those items until you find that special someone.  It's ok to trash things and move on.

If your upset by trashing an item it would do a greater good to look at the item, and asking how you can reduce your consumption or buy with the plan for repair and longevity when you next purchase an item.  And still put that item in the trash.  If you are feeling generous and have the time, take a pic and put it on a buy nothing group for a week.  If there is no interest, accept the groups vote that it isn't valuable and trash it.  But don't hold onto that object for infinity ""until"" (until you find someone who needs it, until you have time to put it up on a buy nothing group, until I have time to fix it, etc.)",declutter,1680533065.0

the fastest way i convinced myself to declutter clothes i held on to but never wore,"a couple weeks ago, i challenged myself to wear or make outfits using the clothes i had either never worn or very rarely wore, instead of my usual go-to clothes or favourite pieces. these were all regular, every day casual clothes, not clothes for special occasions (it's probably fine to only wear that suit or fancy dress once a year).

i had pieces i thrifted/bought years ago and had never left the house wearing. i could never figure out why i had all these 'nice' or 'useful' pieces that fit but were collecting dust. we all have that one piece we immediately take off after trying it on when we're getting ready, but put back because of its 'potential'. so when i was getting dressed, i challenged myself to put on that shirt i always overlooked or never chose to wear and committed to wearing it for the day.

wearing these items was *the* only way to really figure out why i wasn't wearing them. it's a fantasy-self piece (what only the idealised hypothetical version of me would wear), the colour doesn't match my skin tone, it's itchy, it doesn't go with anything in my closet, it doesn't flatter me, it's tight in weird areas, it's not really my style anymore etc etc.

i would be so relieved to take the shirt off at the end of the day because i felt like crap the entire time i was wearing it, and would even feel kinda embarrassed walking around in public wearing certain pieces because they clearly weren't for me. i felt such clarity about these items that i never would have felt if i had've kept sticking to wearing my go-to clothes.

i threw that shirt straight into a box for donation, as well as every other piece i challenged myself to wear by the end of that week.

hopefully this inspires some of you to do something similar! you don't have to be super serious with this approach, i laughed at myself so many times throughout this process because although those items didn't serve a purpose in my wardrobe, they served as a reminder that we are more than our attachment to *things*. that one pair of pants that you haven't chosen to wear in over a year even though they still fit? choose to wear it today or tomorrow over your favourite pair. you'll either realise you should wear them more or realise why you haven't been wearing them.",declutter,1680773437.0
I love decluttering,"This afternoon I was out running lots of errands.  I got a text from the owner of the small rental complex where I live.

I got home an hour before they were due to arrive.  Put away the groceries and the few clean dishes in the dish drainer, and tucked away my shopping bags.  I looked around to see if anything needed cleaning or clearing, but everything looked great so I sat down for a cool drink and a bit of a rest. 

As they were leaving, the prospective tenants said my home was pristine.  The landlord said, ""She's great.  She always keeps the place nice.""

Making a budget unexpectedly made a big difference in maintaining a clutter-free home,"As many of us, I've struggled to maintain a clutter-free space after riding that initial decluttering high. New clutter appeared in my house seemingly out of thin air. Sometimes I did realize that I'm about to buy something I might not really need, but I'd convince myself that I will only try it out and declutter it if I don't like it, or it's fine just this once, or I really do need it after all etc. I'm an impulsive shopper and find it hard to resist the appeal of a shiny new thing, in case it isn't already clear.

&#x200B;

Recently, I've realized that it's time to put my finances in order, or I might end up being perpetually broke. I did the - maybe unnecessarily laborious - work of calculating each of my habitual as well as impulsive purchases, sorted by category, and was shocked by how much I spent on certain categories of items. It made me revaluate what I buy and subsequently bring into my home. I'd look at each category and ask myself questions like ""Am I really okay with spending $100 monthly on vitamins, or can I cut some from my regimen? Do I actually need these hair vitamins when I likely already get all the nutrients I need from food?"" or ""Why do I keep buying spices I will likely only use once or twice for this particular recipe?"". 

&#x200B;

Nowadays, I make a list of all the things I need or want to purchase when I plan my budget for the month. Knowing I can only spend so much makes me carefully consider whether I really want this thing or if it was only a momentary impulse to buy, weigh pros and cons etc. If it's something I buy online, I try to do it all in one day, and unless I write it down or put the item in my cart, I don't even remember I wanted it in the first place 95% of the time. If it's shopping in-store, I make a list in advance and beeline for the items on my list instead of browsing. If I'm shopping for something particular, like a coat, I have to make sure it matches all the needs and wants I have for a coat, because I won't set another coat budget for a while in case this one doesn't fit or perform like I want it to. I still slip up occasionally, but overall it has drastically reduced the new clutter.",declutter,1682104683.0

Whoever recommended these books - thank you!!!,"Wow!  Thank you so much!!  

Yesterday, I finally had the incredible motivation to go through all my makeup, hair supplies, and other junk in my bathroom. 

I have a lot of Audible credits, so I got: 
How to Keep House While Drowning, by KC Davis, LPC and The Hoarder in You, by Dr. Robin Zaslo. 

Since I was going through makeup I haven't worn in years, I started listening to the 2nd book about hoarding. I don't consider myself a hoarder, but I definitely have some tendencies. After listening to that while going through years of makeup - yikes!! I could only listen to a few chapters. It was like a knife in my heart, but in a good way. 

Then I put on How to Keep House, and it was a balm to my soul. Just what I needed. Really,  both of these books are going to be helpful. They're totally different, but I believe they'll really spur me on to do what I need to do as we pack our house to move. 

For the first time, I feel hopeful. 

I'm also having some grace for myself. Instead of berating myself. Between a lifetime of severe trauma and being neurodivergent - I'm actually realizing that I'm doing the best I can. I'm learning to accept myself.  I'm realizing I can be nicer to myself because I seriously am doing my best.

I don't hate dusting anymore!!!,"For me this is a big win.

I've always HATED dusting. Hated it.

Recently I've had 3 separate friends tell me that they can see a huge difference in my house, but it didn't really hit me until now. Because now, I don't hate dusting!

I don't have to put away random stuff from every horizontal surface before I start. I got rid of a bunch of furniture, because I don't need the extra storage anymore. I only have a few beloved pieces (mostly large rocks and books) decorating the surfaces that I did keep.

So dusting my house is now mostly dusting doorframes, beautiful art, and dusting around a few stone specimens on furniture.

It was a win I needed, because I've felt really discouraged, because no matter how much I do, it feels like there is always more. I've been actively purging my home for about 3 years. I do what I can when I can around slowly DIY-renovating, so it's taken a long time.

But after 10 SUV loads of donations, 1 SUV load of electronics recycling, 3 pickup-truck-loads to the dump, uncounted dumpsters and friends picking up stuff, it's making a difference.

The chonky gal has had a bit of an obsession with the garage, and I've kind of leaned into that, because it makes the little goblin feel like she's gotten away with something less nefarious than usual.

The garage has long been a clutter-catcher as my  household has ballooned and shrunk from 1 adult to 5 adults and back down over the last 9 years. It has been my major focus the last couple months, and I've decluttered truckloads of stuff.

A friend who moved out about 5 years ago used to save tons of bacon grease. In my decluttering frenzy, I threw away all the bacon grease, save for one jar, which happened to be one of my favorite little jars that she commandeered.

It was this jar of 5 year old (or older) bacon grease, that I saw my fat little cat dip her paw in, pull out, and lick 5 year old bacon grease from her fluffily little chonky paw.

THIS HOOLIGAN has been hanging out in the garage to get hits of 5 YEAR OLD BACON GREASE.

I calculated out how much she's been eating, and she's within the realm of not-going-to-die-immediately, but at least decluttering revealed her secret cracktivities.",declutter,1684974028.0
What helped me see what clothes I really don't use,"This works the best for things like socks, pants, bras, t-shirst - things you wear the most, basic things. Also bedsheets.

Make a queue. Put all your T-shirts in the queue. After washing they go in the end of the queue in random order, and you pick the first one in queue to wear. What will happen is that you'll see you don't want to wear certain T-shirts or certain pants, because they aren't comfortable enough or don't fit you well, or the fabric doesn't really work for you. It's OK to think it was a wrong day for that specific item and put in back in queue. Next time you'll either like it or dislike it again. For me it's 3 dislikes in a row and I either get rid of the item or donate it if it's still in very good condition.

I'm that person who thinks that ""it's still good, I might use it one day"", ""of course I wear it regularly"", ""it's good quality, of course I'll use it"", and proceed to keep it for 5 years without wearing. And this way helped me see that I will not in fact use it and it's better to get rid of it now, not in 5+ years from now.",declutter,1685709912.0
Loss of an adult child and how to get started,"I lost my 24yr old son about 3 years ago and saved things from his childhood for him and in anticipation of sharing with his children one day. Toys, books, clothes, schoolwork etc. I made books each year of school photos and homework projects, teacher letters and have so many printed photos from growing up as well. I think things most parents would save but possibly more than average as he was my only child. I don‚Äôt like to call it clutter because they mean something to me but I know I can‚Äôt keep around. I have been able to sell/donate furniture and large items. I‚Äôm not sure how or where to start with the sentimental items. Every time I try to reduce I get stuck reminiscing and save things then stop. 

I‚Äôm moving to another country next year and don‚Äôt want to keep things in a storage unit. I don‚Äôt have problems reducing my things and have already made a list of what I‚Äôm taking. It‚Äôs his saved things I have difficulty with and struggle feeling some guilt and remorse. Does anyone else have experience in this and how did you go about, settle on items to keep, set timeline and get things taken care of. Thanks in advance for your advice.

Edit to add..
** I just want to thank everyone for giving such wonderful advice, words of kindness and understanding. Reading the comments of those who have had similar losses and the genuine words of support have brought me to tears. I came here looking for help taking on this challenging task and have received so much more. It‚Äôs something I didn‚Äôt know I needed and I greatly appreciate. 

My son was truly the light of my life. My best friend and the laughter, conversation, smile and love that filled my every day. I just miss him so much and have this hole in my heart with him not here. I know all his things don‚Äôt fill it and I appreciate your advice to get through. I‚Äôve been working hard to accept, grow and learn to live on my own as I know he‚Äôd want me to do. I know he‚Äôs cheering for me and the progress I‚Äôve made. I‚Äôm learning to love life again and live on in his spirit. 

Thank you again so very much. I can‚Äôt tell you how much this helps and means to me‚ù§Ô∏è**",declutter,1685999467.0
What is the feeling of r/declutter on joining the June 12-14 protest blackout?,"Our major options are:

* Join the protest, which would mean no sub access for 48 hours.
* Protest by freezing posts and comments for 48 hours, but not by going dark. This is what mental health subs like r/hoarders and educational subs like r/ELI5 are doing.
* Business as usual as a sub. If you want to individually boycott Reddit, you are encouraged to follow your conscience.

My priority in this situation is to do what best serves the sub. I am 100% sure that making a unilateral decision without input does not do so! I realize that with an issue this controversial, there will be hurt feelings whichever way we go -- apologies in advance.

Background

* [the open letter that explains the issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/)
* [the ELI5 version](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/142kct8/eli5_why_are_subreddits_going_dark/)
* [update on yesterday's news from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/143rk5p/reddit_held_a_call_today_with_some_developers/)

Please state in this thread your views on participating. Don't silence yourself if you see a number of comments supporting the opposite view from yours -- all I have to decide with is what you tell me. 

The Be Kind rule will be strictly enforced in this thread (except you can gripe about Reddit all you like).",declutter,1686246742.0
r/declutter is joining the June 12th-14th protest of Reddit's API changes,"Consensus in the sub was clearly that we should do *something,* with substantial support for full blackout, valid points being raised about taking self-help resources entirely off-line, and equally valid points about whether this kind of protest has a real impact.

Our plan follows, and then the background for what's going on is below that.

## What is r/declutter doing?

* At 00:00 US Eastern time on June 12, we will go fully dark for approximately 48 hours.
* There is substantial talk among mods of assessing the situation after 48 hours and potentially continuing the blackout. Because some of our sub's traffic is from people having crises, I'm not comfortable with staying dark indefinitely. If there is a further protest, we will instead freeze content (no new posts or comments) so that visitors have access to help.
* The master decluttering resource list is backed up [here on Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/letsdeclutter/719603750919159808/master-list-of-decluttering-resources) because that was a lot of work and I don't want to lose it. Right now on Friday, June 9, I have no intention of trying to move the community to Tumblr or any other platform. I like Reddit and simply want it to function more fairly.
* When we come back, there will be a photos-allowed period to celebrate your decluttering progress during the blackout.

Because we have only two sticky spots, the monthly challenge will be unstickied for a while, and the weekend thread will be replaced this week by a collector for tips for dealing with common decluttering issues.

## What's going on?

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app permanently inaccessible to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from Apollo to Reddit is Fun to Narwhal to BaconReader.

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface .

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

## What's the plan?

On June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because we love Reddit, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.

**The two-day blackout isn't the goal, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.**

## What can you do as a user?

* Complain. Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a support request: comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/)
* Spread the word. Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join the coordinated mod effort at /r/ModCoord.
* Boycott and spread the word...to Reddit's competition! Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite non-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!
* Don't be a jerk. As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.",declutter,1686333808.0
r/declutter is in read-only mode in solidarity with the protest of Reddit's API changes,"On Friday, we will open a discussion of how to proceed past this week. The major options are:

* Stay frozen until Reddit changes its policies or some other catalyst occurs.
* Unfreeze and participate in the ""Touch Grass Tuesdays"" protest (Tuesday only freeze or blackout, suggested by the group coordinating the protest).

You will be welcome to make other suggestions, as I'm 100% sure I haven't thought of everything, and in the past, sub discussions have *absolutely* changed my mind -- just be aware that you'll want to make a strong case for your ideas.

**Wait, what's going on?** The earlier blackout post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/145c8z4/rdeclutter_is_joining_the_june_12th14th_protest/). 

**Why are we now frozen?** r/declutter gets some level of mental-health-related traffic, so I am not currently comfortable with a continued shutdown of all access.

**Why aren't you just closing the sub if you don't like what Reddit's doing?** First, because the idea behind the protest was to *change* what Reddit is doing. Second, because my responsibility to this sub is to help it be healthy, safe, and productive, which means listening to its members. Third, because there is no comparable resource anywhere else (other than maybe on FB, which has its own downsides).

**Why wait until Friday?** It's a time frame in which (a) things might happen and (b) members stopping by have some warning that we're going to discuss it. Also, the sub usually gets higher traffic on the weekend, so waiting makes it easier to include more people. (Pinned posts lose traction after 2-3 days, as most people don't read in Hot mode.)

**What happens if you really don't like my POV?** If you're polite about it, nothing. This is a controversial issue. I'm not enjoying a situation where sub members may feel really negatively about one another! Go ahead and express negative feelings about any aspect of what's happening, just assume that anyone involved in this sub is acting in good faith.",declutter,1686708158.0

My husbands Nanna unfortunately passed in 2020, her husband has said he's really struggling with her stuff being everywhere especially the kitchen and he'd like to just go back to basics because he doesn't know how to use half the stuff anyway. There is also some furniture 

Now my mil doesn't want any of it to go because it was her mums from when she was little. She has been told she's welcome to whatever she would like, she has had 3 years to help herself but her house is full to the brim with her dads stuff and anybody else that has passed and she seems to think I'm heartless wanting to get rid of her mums things. 

I intend to donate anything that I can, I understand loosing a parent is hard and I'm not going to pretend that I don't feel weird about sorting through this stuff but Nanna isn't coming back no matter how much we want her to.

I just want nannas husband to be comfortable, it was totally heartbreaking to see a 80 year old man totally break down and tell me he can't cope with the stuff and doesn't want to be judged by my mil. I've told him it's not like we're throwing nanna out and it's his house anyway.

Holy shit I violently decluttered and it feels GREAT,"**EDIT: Well isn't this just the loveliest community on reddit ü•π Thank you all for the kind words and I wish you all the best in your declutter journeys! We own stuff, stuff doesn't own us!**

I have lived by myself since May 2020 and somehow accumulated an ungodly amount of stuff. I moved from a 2b/2ba (with a roommate) to a 1b/1ba in March 2021.

I have always had hoarding tendencies, and I am a person who can ascribe sentimentality to anything. If I ordered something online that had pretty packaging, you can bet I‚Äôd save the box, or the ribbon it was tied in. I was certain I‚Äôd use one or both for something in the future. Such pretty ribbon, the possibilities were endless! I'm crafty, so I used it occasionally, but not frequently enough to justify saving it. 

I was convinced that I needed to have multiples of things, in case I lost the current one (common) or just because it was cheaper. Why get one nail clipper for $5 when I could get six for $4?

I made sure to keep boxes and instruction manuals. What if I needed them? I wanted the boxes for when I moved, right?  What if I forgot how to use this cheap electronic good I bought? What if I wanted to see the recipes that came with the Vitamix my mother gave me as a hand-me-down? It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs available online, right?

What about the items I bought for projects I wanted to do? I had furniture legs I wanted to spray paint. I still own that spray paint, but I can‚Äôt remember what furniture I bought it for. Does that matter? I should keep the paint, right? It‚Äôs brand new and unused!

I love clothing, and have a lot of it. Much is comprised of things that fit before covid, but definitely don‚Äôt fit now. Even more of it is stuff that I have loved, but doesn‚Äôt fit my current aesthetic. Or isn‚Äôt my size. This includes shoes. I have a pair of Doc Martens I bought at Goodwill for $40 that I adore the style of, but they just don‚Äôt fit. I've owned them for six years, and haven't worn them once. But I can‚Äôt get rid of them! They sorta fit, and it was a bargain! Maybe one day I‚Äôll want to wear them?

I have spent so much time organizing. I have bought countless organizers to aid me. I have given tons of money to Bed, Bath, and Beyond, or The Container Store, finding the perfect items that would help me organize my stuff. I would be satisfied when I did a clean, but it never lasted long. Because I was just piling these things on top of each other, still hopeful I was going to use it in the future. I didn‚Äôt, because they were buried, stacked on each other, or tucked away, to the point that I forgot what I had and bought new ones to cover.

You may be surprised to hear that my home is neat and tidy. If you came over, you wouldn‚Äôt know that I had too much. I don‚Äôt like visual clutter. But what that means is that I‚Äôve pushed all the clutter into the unseen spaces ‚Äî my bedroom closet, my hallway closet, the depths of my kitchen cabinets, underneath my bed. None of these places are fun or easy to investigate. Every time I managed the energy to go through them, I was surprised by what I found there, because it‚Äôs made up of things I wanted and needed but have had no ability to find or use because of how densely packed it was.

I‚Äôm planning on moving in with my partner of three years later this year and I decided that I need to do the hard things now to save myself suffering later.

I have cleared out six u-haul boxes worth of donateables, and twenty 40-gallon bags of trash and recycling. I have said goodbye to items that I have been desperately clinging onto for 10+ years (stuffed animals that had sentimental value but that I had buried in closets, gifts from friends I couldn‚Äôt bear to give away but that I didn‚Äôt love and never wanted, extras of things I had bought but recognized that if I was tidy, I wouldn‚Äôt need copies of, stuff I promised myself I was going to sell but didn't get around to doing so).

It has felt GREAT. I have had little to no regret of what I‚Äôve let go. I have felt immense pride that I‚Äôm finally curating a space that I enjoy. I thought I would be more hesitant, would have more struggles, but honestly none of these feelings are strong or impactful enough for me to change course. Most of what I'm discarding, whether by donation or trash, is stuff I thought I would be desperately attached to that has ended up meaning very little.

Of course I have made choices that are uncomfortable for me. Many. Gifts, memories, items with enduring sentimental value, perfectly good items that I own several of and don't truly need, things I spent good money on but never used or returned. But none of them have bested me, and none of them have been more important to me than feeling clean, happy, efficient, ready for something new. I can feel confident in future purchases because they are things I truly want, rather than things I've collected out of convenience. I can buy a pair of those Doc Martens that actually fit instead of telling myself I own a similar pair, knowing that I will both never use them nor get rid of them.

I can't wait to bring things into my life, and my home, that are specific, wanted, curated, and valued. And to combine what I own and love with that of my partner.

What has been most important for me is:

\- You aren't wasting money by throwing it out. You wasted money by purchasing it. So let it go.

\- Do you love it? Or are you keeping it out of guilt or obligation?

\- Would you think of or remember this item if you hadn't seen it cleaning? Will a picture of it suffice?

\- Is it replaceable, if you're truly worried about it being thrown away?

\- Would another person be able to use and enjoy the item? Would that be better than hiding it away for yourself and not using it?

\- Are you choosing what to throw away? Or are you choosing what you genuinely want to have and keep?

\- Throw away the ribbon. Throw away the box. If you truly need and desire these things, you can buy them individually, less often than you'd think.

\- Watch Hoarders while decluttering. Really.

I hope this helps or inspires someone with their own declutter. Relinquishing control feels amazing, as a person who struggles with OCD. It's possible and it's lovely.",declutter,1688721245.0
Lessons learned from running a garage sale that featured 25+ years of stuff,"This past weekend I helped out at a garage sale that was selling things that had been accumulated for 25+ years. Furniture, clothing, kids stuff, books, housewares etc. You name it, we probably had one or two for sale.

Here is what I learned:

* Don't save things for life events you aren't 100% certain are happening. There were so many baby items, kids toys, cribs, rocking chairs etc. These had been saved for ""our grandchildren"", when there are no grandchildren. Don't keep things for the promise of a life event if you aren't 100% certain it will happen. Beyond the fact that there are no grandchildren, 80% of these baby items were outdated, out of style or potentially hazardous. Unless you know for a fact that your son/daughter has specifically asked to keep their crib for their own kid, get rid of it once you no longer have a baby for that crib. There is no guarantee that you will have the grandchildren, and there is no guarantee that *if* you have grandchildren, that the items will be wanted/in style or even safe.

* Not everything appreciates in value, and saving things because they 'might be worth something someday' is not worth it. We had a couple people asking for comics, and there were two available for sale. Really good condition, saved in plastic packaging, very well preserved. However the price was $5 per comic, based on the fact that when purchased in the 90s they were $2.50, and so they must be worth more by now. No one wanted them until we knocked them down in price. Just because some comics are rare and valuable doesn't mean all of them are. Don't save things for a potential that may never happen. Don't get me started on beanie babies -_-

* No one wants to pay $$$ for used clothing and shoe items. Many of the shoes and clothes were priced in a range that might sell well on ebay/poshmark/mercari, but were unreasonable for garage salers. No one wanted leather boots for $40. For $40 you can buy a new pair of leather boots. If you're looking to sell clothes and shoes at a garage sales, price low. People who want to wear them will buy them and they will be gone and out of your hair which is the goal. People who want to spend $15 on a sweater are more likely to buy that online or at a thrift store than at a garage sale. 

* Get a library card. There were so many books for sale. All of them read, but only once. Unless you are a huge fan of someone or a fandom, want to support the author or collect books, get a library card and enjoy your reading that way. Books take up so much space and are hard to get rid of. They are also never worth their value after the fact. Don't pay $18 for a book and then sell it for $1, get a library card and enjoy your reading for free.

Hope this helps someone who might be saving some things and struggling to get rid of them.",declutter,1688994835.0
Has anyone reading here ACTUALLY successfully donated old towels and/or sheets to animal shelters?,"This seems to be something floating around and comes up whenever people want to get rid of these items.

They're charred remnants of dead animals and don't have any spiritual or mystical properties, but I still feel I have to dispose of them in some sort of respectful way because when I was growing up, pets were part of the family and that's how I've always viewed my own. 

Anyone have suggestions?

Edit: I am moving across country into a much higher cost-of-living area to help family. Lots of unknowns at this point, but I know I be forced to majorly downsize and am ruthlessly leaving behind everything I can because moving is super expensive. 
The six urns are metal, about 7"" x 5"", and they just sit in a cabinet. The oldest urn is about 20 years old and the most recent about 6 years old.

I will keep a small amount of ashes from each cat and put them in one urn or a vase or some other decorative item, then spread the remaining ashes somewhere nice before I leave. I still have a little memento from each cat - a collar, a favorite toy, a comb, etc. Even if had nothing, they would always be remembered and loved. 

Thank you all for so many good ideas, and also for your kindness and compassion. 

I am sitting with my two current 'feline family members' right now and telling them how much I love and appreciate them.",declutter,1690140127.0
I hope this doesn't sound too harsh - but I really had a reality check this past week.,"So this is going to be a little long and possibly triggering for folks who have control issues as well as clutter issues. (which is probably many people here - it certainly describes me) And please keep in mind that I also have pack-rat tendencies and I am NOT judging here. I have my own issues. Particularly with vintage cookware and Christmas decorations...and cookbooks....and DVDs.....and art supplies - you get the idea. But I just got a dose of reality and I hope that passing it along might help someone look at their possessions in a different light. It helped me quite a bit.

My husband and I have two sets of aging parents who have been married for 50+ years. Three if you count my childless Aunt and Uncle ‚Äì they will also be my responsibility when the time comes. These three couples live in three states of clutter. My parents are full on clutterers - border line hoarders, my Aunt and Uncle are all about the facade, and my in-laws live in a house so clean it‚Äôs like a museum.

Well my MIL went into memory care last week, and FIL decided to downsize, so it was time to clean out the museum. For those of you who have never helped clean out a relative‚Äôs house this is how it goes. (And for those of you who have ‚Äì it is SO much worse when the relative is ‚Äòhelping‚Äô.)

Your process starts off as respectful as possible. Items are arranged in piles ‚Äì to throw, recycle, donate, redistribute. The 25 bottles half full of hand cream hidden in the linen closet is endearing and the bottles are moved to a pile so they can be redistributed or donated if they are still usable. But the days wear on, and the 15 pairs of nail clippers in the bathroom vanity, 30 pairs of headphones in the desk; jackets and purses and tote bags oh my!; old electronics that don‚Äôt work, stacks of stereo components, and enough coolers for all the tailgaters in Pittsburgh - start to wear on you and the lines between those neat piles you were making start to blur. All this stuff has to be hauled out of here to go wherever it is going. We have three pickup trucks but a limited number of days to get back to our lives and now the guilt that we all feel when we are going through our own things doubles and triples because now it is someone else‚Äôs life we are dealing with.

Finally you get so overwhelmed that nearly everything, including that first pile of hand cream bottles, is shoved into contractor bags and hauled to the dump because there is just. Too. Much.

And that was the MUSEUM. The neatest of the three houses. My in-laws had already done the ‚ÄòSwedish Death Cleaning.‚Äô

My Aunt and Uncle have undoubtedly done the same thing as my in-laws ‚Äì hid their messes away in closets and drawers - but in addition they have a 'secret' storage unit, a doll collection that takes up an entire room in the house and every flat surface in every other room PLUS an obsession with QVC jewelry most of which is still in its packaging?!?! Right ‚Äì never worn. She couldn‚Äôt wear it all in her lifetime. And I am their sole heir. Lucky me. W.T.F.

My parents live in a three-decker home with a full basement in an historic neighborhood. That is four floors of Stuff. Yesterday, my husband and I concluded that when the time comes, we are just going to have to park a dumpster in the driveway and throw stuff out the windows. I am NOT kidding. It will be the only way to deal with the 90% stuff vs 10% objects of sentiment/value.

So before I started unpacking the 10 boxes of stuff from the museum to add to my own pile of stuff, (I know! Right? We ALL have our issues. No judgements here.) I started to go through my own things first. I have quite a donation pile already and it‚Äôs only been a day. I think what I‚Äôm getting at here is that it might help to look at your things as though they are someone else‚Äôs things. Try (Gods know it‚Äôs hard) to distance yourself from the stuff. Because sooner or later they WILL be someone else‚Äôs things. And they will be overwhelmed.

Blessings and good luck.

Flylady vs Mom the Hoarder,"I have said many times, my mom is a hoarder. She can purge, she just has too much stuff and it all has to be out or she forgets she owns it.  Probably about a level 2-3.

When the kids were little, Mom was on her way to hoarding up our house as well as hers + a two story two car garage and several out buildings. The amount of toys this woman bought when she visited for a one year old was INSANE.

I was a young mom, two small kids, and though our house was plenty large enough, the stuff was overwhelming me. That's when I discovered Flylady. Back in those days the system was very simplistic.  Clean as you normally would. Declutter in one zone a week.  Daily missions that included things we tend to overlook.  

But one thing Flylady said that I had never heard growing up was ""DON'T PULL OUT MORE THAN YOU CAN DO IN 15 MINS!""  My mom would empty entire rooms, wash curtains, wash walls, wash carpet. Then become exhausted and would go months before replacing items and when she did, it was just put it where ever  you can find a spot.  I really took the flylady system to heart. 

I learned if I wanted to clean out my dresser and organize, only do one drawer at a time.

If I wanted to organize the pantry, I only emptied on shelf at a time!

Slowly but surely I organized and decluttered. Kids grew and toys and clothes changed, but we kept a tidy home without the chaos I grew up in. (Mom is 82 and still lives in chaos, despite me trying to teach her flylady's system).

You see, Marla (aka Flylady) understood something my mom never did.  Decluttering is emotionally and physically exhausting!  So she taught me to break it up into small 15 minute chunks. No matter how tired I got, I could organize and replace the items if I only took out a small amount. And I tended to be more brutal that first  15 minutes than I was after an hour!

So I hope this week, you will break your decluttering into 15 minute blocks and have several successes throughout  your week over one big task that overwhelms you to the point that  you never want to declutter ever again!",declutter,1690732386.0
this ‚Äúholding on is harder‚Äù quote really speaks to me,"‚ÄúWhen you struggle to let go of stuff, remember that holding on is harder. You have to hold on to it every day but you only have to let go of it once. You hold on to stuff with your time, money, attention and emotion. When you let go, you free up those resources for something else. Something more meaningful and relevant to where you are right now.

‚ÄúFor a long time, I held on thinking, ‚Äòit‚Äôs not hurting anything‚Äô and when I realized it wasn‚Äôt helping anything either, I let go. It has to help, or add value, or make me smile ‚Ä¶ or it‚Äôs gone.‚Äù

"Ah, a rage purge. How nice.","Part 1. Catch-all areas, bathroom, and parents‚Äô bedroom.

Had a stressful morning, came home and couldn‚Äôt even relax with a book because the house was so triggering. I‚Äôd planned to go out biking and recharge, but couldn‚Äôt handle that either. 

So I started purging the house. Receipts. Trash. Old business cards. ‚ÄòPerfectly good‚Äô old summer anklet that just makes me bitter about northwestern weather. Old magazines and an essential oil to our neighborhood ‚Äòfree cupboard‚Äô where people pick up and drop off stuff that‚Äôs too small or odd to bother donating to a thrift store, but can make someone‚Äôs day.

Old game pieces. Hair ties. Dead batteries. A cd book. Real books that I thrifted and don‚Äôt love enough to keep. An armful of clothes or cloths to the donation and textile recycling box.


Part 2. School/craft cupboard 

The great thing about a rage purge is that the overwhelming vibe of frustration and anger overrides guilt or rational thoughts of, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm sure it could be useful for SOMETHING.‚Äù The downside (or is it upside?) is it takes a lot of frustration before I boil over. In this case it‚Äôs the lack of initiation in my family. Everyone‚Äôs cheerful about helping when asked to tidy up‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt WANT to have to ask. I don‚Äôt want to have to be the one reminding everyone to put away laundry, bring back game pieces to the board game shelf, or take out the recycling. Why is it my job to set aside holey socks, refill our stock of batteries, and check that we don‚Äôt run out of pencils and school supplies? What about deciding whether we need to keep the rain cover for our stroller (executive decision after months of doubt: we don‚Äôt). 

Not going to get into gender bashing here; I‚Äôm sure there are stressed-out men who are dealing with the clutter at home from their messy, hands-off wives and kids too. And I‚Äôm very open with my husband about being very conscious of how if I micro-manage things, everyone just expects me to continue micro-managing. We‚Äôve had many, many talks, both friendly and rational and angry and crying (on my part) about how clutter ratchets up my anxiety and stress and makes me feel like I can‚Äôt handle life. I‚Äôm not throwing blame blindly. BUT. If the general consensus is that it‚Äôs my job to be responsible for stuff while the kids are still young‚Ä¶ then fine. I will just make sure there is less stuff to handle. A heck of a lot less. Hence the rage cleaning.

Part 3. Living room/kitchen

How did they manage to break Duplo? It‚Äôs basically indestructible! Out with that piece. And a cute purple box with a chip in it. Repeating to myself: ‚ÄòI do not need to make everyone happy. I need to get this space decluttered before school starts.‚Äô Listening to decluttering podcasts and vlogs: too many nice people and not enough angry people saying, ‚ÄúIt is ok to be angry with feeling out of control in your house. Getting rid of junk, and making those unmade decisions, will help everyone.‚Äù 

Why do we still have as many mugs as we did when we had big groups of friends over? Let‚Äôs donate 5. Why do I keep all these too-hard games in our daily use cupboard? Let‚Äôs put those up high for next year. Why do we still have all these big reusable shopping bags since we‚Äôve switched to the little ones? Let‚Äôs donate those. Extra silicone baby bibs - donate. Wall art - donate (since I thrifted it four years ago for about 7 euros, I‚Äôm pretty sure we‚Äôve gotten our moneys worth out already.) Extra headphone cables - donate.

What I notice is that so many items were annoyingly in the way ‚Äî only for me. The kids just push things out of the way to find what they need. So does my husband, or he‚Äôs not normally using that cupboard or drawer anyway so it doesn't occur to him to try to organize it. Or he thinks it‚Äôs my domain. Or something. 

I rationalize a lot, trying to be kind and not bitter, which is why it sometimes just builds up until I want to burn the whole house down and start fresh somewhere else. [Edit: I don‚Äôt actually want our house to burn down. We know people who had that, and it‚Äôs horrible and traumatic and expensive. I just want a fresh start and can‚Äôt see any way out of this struggle.] ‚ÄúBut then you‚Äôll just have the same problems, somewhere else!‚Äù is a normal argument to that idea. Um, no we wouldn‚Äôt. Because then my husband and kids and I would not be dealing with a backlog of years of stuff. I.e., my husband‚Äôs untouched old textbooks would be burned up, without me even having to say anything. My box of crafts that sits unused while I spend my ‚Äòfree time‚Äô cleaning or helping others would also be burned up. But then I‚Äôd actually have time to buy another pack of markers or knitting supplies and do it, because I wouldn‚Äôt be wasting hours deciding, ‚ÄúHave the kids grown out of this train set? Is it wasteful to trash all the pink and white hair ties so we just have a basic set of black? Will husband get annoyed for how I‚Äôm filling up the front hall with undecided items and trash bags of donations?‚Äù

We‚Äôve decided that we‚Äôre not going to move for another five years, so there is zero external motivation to dejunk, and lots of external motivation to leave things the way they are. How nice would it be to just put on blinders instead of being a cranky mom and wife because of all the choice overwhelm and anxiety. And I know all the good advice about motivating/including family to help towards a common goal. I know that in a few years, we won‚Äôt have to baby-and-toddler-proof everything (and I‚Äôll hopefully be sleeping through the night). Bigger kids will be able to take more responsibility for their life. Maybe I‚Äôll get better at being assertive instead of guilty. Maybe we‚Äôll have more digitized, and less physical stuff lying around. I‚Äôll have more brain space to handle my own workload, teaching, parenting, and still have time to recharge on my own. Different life seasons. 

Maybe I just need to schedule monthly rage cleans so I actually get stuff done fast, and then don‚Äôt have to feel constantly anxious about the clutter.

I realized it's okay to toss things that are still usable,"My FIL had a several year long battle with cancer that he lost, so all the time and energy went into doctors, being sick, trying to do what he could with time left. Now after over a year after his passing his widow is trying to stay busy and improve the house that he build basically himself. A big pain point for her was the basement, already full before they got married and only getting worse. So when my SO and I visited, we wanted to help. There were so much good stuff there that someone would have wanted, workout equipment, nice kids toys, unused stuff for keeping animals etc. I initially wanted to donate it and sell the nice things, but hearing her distress and how much it depressed her, I realized that the best thing we can do is just get rid of as much as possible as quickly as possible. We ordered a dumpster and tossed all the easy decisions stuff. Since then, she was able to finally start sorting through the harder things, and we turned part of it into a game room and had a few fun nights. There's no way we would have gotten it done doing it the ""proper way"". I do feel bad about putting things into the landfill, but I try to buy less and contribute that way, instead of using my house as a landfill.

Majorly decluttered my wardrobe and surprisingly getting compliments on the most random items.,"My motto for a few years was accumulate clothes and have a closet full of variety. People would give me clothes. I went to thrift stores. I'd get rid of clothes slowly as wanted/needed.

I challenged myself to wear every single item in my closet (within reason, fancy dresses excluded) before re-wearing. I spent a day putting together outfits. I had all these screenshots of outfits and I was like, how can I make that from my closet. I wasn't strict on it. After wearing it, I got rid of anything I thought I would never wear again, or realistically if I had only worn it like twice since owning it. I had clothes that I loved but the underwear needed was annoying so I'd never wear it - donated.  And the list goes on. I got rid of half my closet.

I got compliments on the most random clothes that were 8 years old. I'm so much happier with my closet. I know everything in there fits me properly now. And I know how to mix and match things wayyy better than I did. I can throw together an outfit much quicker. Before it took me forever. I actually wear more variety in my outfits now with less clothes than I did with more clothes.

Declutter motivation: remember that time you found the best item of your life at a thrift store?,"I'll never forget when I found my vintage fur shortcoat. I was ecstatic -- it fit me perfectly.

I looked up the designer and the store it was from closed for good in the 80's.

I took care of it for a long time, and don't have the coat anymore. When it didn't fit right I donated it back to the thrift store I bought it from.

This past week I took a few days off work (which I'm fortunate to do, I know) and got some cardboard boxes from Lowes to do a deep clean of my apartment. 

The hardest part of doing a deep clean for me is to get side-tracked in the decluttering phase (i.e. sorting through stuff) and then I become so overwhelmed that I usually only do a room and feel bad about it later. 

This time though, I decided that anything that wasn't trash was put into one of those boxes I got, a to be dealt with later box. And I continue cleaning. It has worked wonders!

Until today.

Helping my parents move. It‚Äôs made me equally angry and motivated.,"I took the whole month of August off of work so that I could help my parents (78f/80m) move.  I went home for a couple of days because my kids were going back to school and I wanted to be there for them. I live 2 states away, about an 8 hour drive. 

My parents have lived in the same house for 51 years. Obviously they‚Äôre going to have some stuff, and a lot of unnecessary stuff, but helping them pack and clean has really opened my eyes to their well maintained hoard.  They always kept a neat house, has guests over frequently, and has money to hire a person to clea. But under the surface it‚Äôs a wreck. 

Their house is like a museum.  My mother is a really sentimental person, and it‚Äôs been making this process more difficult because she thinks of the house as another person in her life.  Three of my grandparents died before I was born, a one grandmother dies about 20 years ago. This is part of the problem, my mother can‚Äôt part with her parents old things. It‚Äôs generational, because a lot of the stuff is from great-grand parents, great-greats and so on. There is no way she will part with a single thing but that‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs has great value to her. 

But where I really got frustrated is when I found her collection of used ziplock bags, a collection 30-year-old plastic butter tubs, rocks, sticks, rubber bands, recipes, lists and notebooks, gloves that are missing their pair,  scraps of fabric, and mostly burnt but not quite finished birthday candles.  The list could go on. Dad and I rented a 20‚Äô truck just to transport her house plant collection but still had to make a second run because not all of the orchids would fit.  I just don‚Äôt get how the ziplock bags have as much value to her as the heirloom antiques. And I‚Äôm exhausted by the month long work (she even had several days that professional packers came to box everything we couldn‚Äôt get to).

I‚Äôm tempted to fully explore ‚ÄúThe Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning‚Äù because I don‚Äôt want my kids to have to go through what this month has been like.  I haven‚Äôt read it, it‚Äôs on my bucket list. 

The thing is, my mother and her sisters had to rent a dumpster and it took them nearly a year to get through my grandmothers secret hoard. They were so disgusted when they found several garbage bags full of old stocking (grandma was a teen during the Great Depression) and cans of food from the 1950‚Äôs (found in 2005).

When You Declutter a Family Heirloom It Can Mean a Lot... to Someone Else's Family,"Have any of you found WWII relics in your parents‚Äô homes? Here is a story to warm your hearts!

The Obon Society helps those who have these heirlooms and would like to return them to the servicemen‚Äôs families, providing the opportunity for reconciliation between families through the return of Non-Biological Human Remains taken during war.

Life after living with a hoarder: divorce/separation edition.,"Another update post. I know some across this sub have been following my journey. This time, I'm seeking insight and perspective. 

TL,DR: Just left my abusive husband about 4-5 days ago. Among his laundry list of issues was a ***serious*** hoarding problem. Finally ripped the proverbial band-aid off earlier this week and told him I think we should separate. We stayed in separate hotels this week, and I just picked up the keys to my new (rental) condo yesterday. 

Married nine years. Thankfully, no kids. We spent the last 3.5 years in a 2,700+ sq ft house (that HE wanted to buy but barely ended up contributing to either financially or by way or chores/upkeep), and he kept stuff piled floor to ceiling in the two-car garage, the 1,400 sq ft of finished basement area, both utility rooms in the basement, all three guest rooms, and even in the bathroom that was in the basement. 

I spent 3.5+ years asking him to declutter and purge and clean. Zip, nada, zilch. Most of my requests fell on deaf ears. Even in the final ~90 days leading up to the sale of the house, he *still* barely lifted a finger around the house. I did as much as I could on my own, but because I have an autoimmune disease that affects my musculoskeletal system, I had to hire professional junk removal crews (on several occasions) to help with a lot of the heavier lifting. Not only did that cost me thousands of $, but it also easily consumed hundreds of hours of my own time, too. 

Yesterday, I picked up the keys to my new (rental) condo. It's a 1bd/1ba condo and approximately ~1,100 sq ft. Aside from a few items in the fridge, it's completely empty at the moment. I'm staying at a friend's place right now (she's away for her wedding) cat-sitting for the next ~10 days, so at least I've got a bed to sleep in while I wait for my own bed to arrive at my new place. 

My experience living with a hoarder has completely and utterly shifted/altered my relationship with and perspective on the concept of ""stuff"". Whenever someone asks me about furnishing my new place, or when family members make well-intentioned recommendations, I internally panic and feel paralyzed. *No*, my brain thinks. Beyond a bed, one fork, one knife, one spoon, one plate, one cup, and *maybe* one small couch/sofa, I don't want anything. 

I feel like ""minimalist vibe"" is a term that gets thrown around a lot these days, but for me, it has taken on deeper and different meaning. When I see photos of what is coined as a ""minimalist vibe"", I almost feel sick to my stomach. It still feels like too much clutter and stuff. 

Has anyone dealt with this sort of thing? How do I get past this paralyzing feeling within me? 

I also labeled my post with the success stories flare, because aside from my panicked feelings about future decor and furnishings, I consider my situation a win. I got out. I escaped. Although I'm an emotional yo-yo right now, I'm looking forward to slowly rebuilding and regaining my peace and freedom.",declutter,1694869479.0
Lesson learned: use items rather than just holding on to them,"I decided to do a bit of organization of my closet today.  To my utter shock and disappointment, as I pulled a handbag off a shelf, the coating on the fabric portion came off in flakes all over my hands.  

I really loved this bag, but it was kind of heavy, and a bit too ""fancy"" for my day-to-day life. Its been in my closet for years. Now its completely useless. I would not even be able to sell this as the top area is disintegrating. Its a complete waste, even though the leather portion, strap, zipper, interior, etc, is in perfect condition.

I should have sold it or donated it years ago. But I liked it and always thought I'd have a day/time to use it.  I never thought it would disintegrate sitting in my closet, but I will take this as a lesson to use what I own when I have it. If I don't use it, its a sign I don't need it. ",declutter,1695076553.0

Has anyone else had a sudden realization of how much money they have wasted?,I started decluttering a few weeks ago and recently it hit me. All of the things I have bought that I do not use or decided I did not like and kept it on a shelf instead of returning it. I waste money that could be going to better things like savings and debts. I have started a no buy. I have not been perfect but I have been more thoughtful when I have made a purchase.,declutter,1697386313.0
"""If it isn't a clear YES, then it's a NO"": How to encourage yourself to let go.","
I have been browsing this sub for a while but never posted.

Someone here suggested ""The Minimal Mom"" YouTube channel, and holy crap is it mind blowing. Anyone who has NOT watched her channel should watch it. Her most useful videos are mostly the ones at the top of her list, after you sort by popularity. I will give the TL;DR of her long videos below:

In one of her videos, she says the phrase, ""If it isn't a clear YES, then it's a NO."" This one stuck with me the most and has really made it easier on me to declutter. Basically, if you cannot _justify_ why you still have something, then you should toss it or donate it. For example, let's say you have a bookshelf (like she does in her video). If you grab a random item off your bookshelf, you should be able to say ""yes, I need it,"" or ""yes, I am using it."" If not, then in the trash bin it goes or in the donation bin it goes. There is no ""but i will use it eventually."" That is not a clear YES. If you have not used it in a few months, you probably won't use it at all. But I realize this is sometimes easier said than done.

In another video, she says that if you _really_ cannot part with something, then grab a medium sized cardboard box (like one from Amazon or whatever) and put those ""idk if I can part with this"" items in there. Pack them as if you are going to donate them, but DON'T donate them yet. Just pack them and put the box somewhere ‚Äî out of sight, out of mind. Make sure the box is closed, too. If, after a set amount of time (like 3 months), you never thought about the items in that box or looked for any of the items in it, then donate the box as is.

If you look for an item and it happens to be in that box, then by all means, take it out. But the rest of the stuff? Donate or toss because you clearly aren't using it.

If you want to sell your items instead of donating, then set a threshold. A $3/¬£3 item isn't worth trying to sell. Sorry. Set your threshold to something like $50/¬£50 or whatever you want, but be reasonable about it. If the item is below $50, then donate it. Don't bother trying to sell every sub $50 item, or you will end up keeping a lot of it while you try to find a buyer, and that can cause you to have second thoughts.

For memorabilia and other highly sentimental items, that is tricky and I have to work on this myself, but I hope these general tips help! I am really liking The Minimal Mom.",declutter,1697470576.0

Giving beanie babies to trick or treaters?,"I‚Äôve posted recently about my mission to declutter and got great advice so I‚Äôm hoping to get your input especially from any parents. Would it be weird to give out beanie babies at Halloween to trick or treaters? They are all in mint condition but I just have so many and I don‚Äôt need or want them. I am keeping three but the rest (like 80) I would like to give away. We get 100+ plus kids an hour where I live so I know it can be done. The thing is would parents be weirded out? Would they think it‚Äôs a problem regarding germs? Again they are all in great condition with tags attached but I don‚Äôt know what other parents would think. I have a son and I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to this but every parent is different. What do you think? 

Also, we do have candy to give out so not just the babies. I‚Äôm even considering if I should tie candy to each of them with  Halloween ribbon to make it look more appealing.

UPDATE: Thank you all so much for your thoughts! I bought some cute Halloween ribbon today from Michaels and will be having the babies as an option in a basket. :) Very excited!

POST HALLOWEEN UPDATE!! I gave away all my beanie babies in about an hour! Soooo many kids and parents loved them!! Many parents asked me in excited disbelief if I was seriously giving them away. I loved seeing all the happy faces :)) and surprisingly it didn‚Äôt sting or hurt giving them away. Granted, I did keep 3 that were my most favorite.

A strange advice for those of us who can't control the urge to buy,"Buy a single expensive item. Lets say you want to blow 100, 500, 1000$ on dresses, because it's the time of the year, the mood, every dress you have is not the one, you know. You will spend it. You know you will (because I know I will even if I dont have budget). You'll try to fight the urge to do it but then you will. Then instead of getting 10 cheap dresses, buy freaking Teuta Matoshi or some other designer brand that fits your style. Spend the budget on one dress instead of 10. If you want a whole bunch of new aromatic candles - buy one, high quality candle. Or a handmade teacup from a small business.

You will feel better, you won't end up having a bunch of things you have no idea what to do with, and the thing you'll get will be high quality. And also it's harder to make an impulsive purchase of an expencive item and you have to spend time chosing the right one.

Not the motivation we need but the motivation we deserve.",declutter,1698059628.0
I should have sold my American Doll in 1999,"I have a Felicity doll with a few official outfits, including some made my great aunt, in a box in my basement. She's in extraordinary condition because I always took care of her. Like many girls of the 80s and 90s, I poured over the American Doll catalogue every month, wondering at many girls beautiful dresses and things, and reading about their lives in that impossible land of the past. 

Felicity, though, was the doll I wanted, with her little flowered dress she had sewn herself and her red hair with three neat little curls on each side of her face. I saved up for months for her - which at $82 was a King's ransom to me. My mom made a deal that she would pay for half, but the other half I had to save up for. And I sold homemade stationary door-to-door at 50 cents a packet for it. (Although generous family members gave me as much a $5). Finally, I had enough, and she came. She was given a place of honor on my bedroom dresser. I'd play with her, of course, but I also would simply display her and change her outfit to fit the season or my mood. Sometimes I'd take her to friends' houses and we'd play with our American Dolls together. 

Of course, I eventually grew out of dolls, and Felicity was put in a box. And I still have that box, intending to gift her to a daughter or a niece. Well, so far, I don't have any daughters or nieces. I'm still keeping her - maybe  there still will be a little girl I can give her to, or even a little boy - kids are more free from gender restrictions these days. I'm lightly considering displaying her again - but  But I also know that while they might enjoy her, I cannot recreate the magic of that catalogue or saving up for her.

So, I'm realizing now I should have sold her back in 1999, when there were still lots of little girls who wildly wanted such a doll, but maybe couldn't afford a new one. Perhaps that means she'd be in someone else's box right now, or maybe she'd even be in the dump, having gone through many small hands. But she would have been used.

But then again, now that I still have her, I think I might keep her and maybe display her - creepy old lady vibes or not. ",declutter,1698249941.0

decluttered and now I feel bad,"Cleaned out late mom's linen closet, she was a packrat, as in the house was presentable but every closet and drawer is stuffed.

A trick I discovered that can help you actually get rid of sentimental clothes.,"I'm someone who has emotions attached to certain items of clothing. Whether it's the dress I wore at my college graduation, a blouse I wore when I had my first kiss, or whatever. Or maybe it's just a pair of shoes I wore as a teenager that remind me of walking the halls of my high school with my friends and running around the neighborhood after dark. 

If you have a stash of sentimental clothes, do this --- put them on. 

I was hanging on to a hoodie I wore years ago, at a time I was dating my ex. It was a hoodie I wore to a job that I loved, and I wore it often outside of work. I practically lived in it. 

But when I actually put it on, I hated how it made me feel. It reminded me of my ex and that specific time in my life, and I realized how far I've come and how much my life has changed since then. I am not the same person. And there was no reason to hang on to the hoodie because I would never wear it again.

In fact, I couldn't wait to take it off.

Now this isn't to say you should get rid of all your sentimental clothes, but only if you really don't have the space for them anymore. If you're seriously looking to declutter, try this tip! ",declutter,1702230128.0
Life after hoarding: divorce edition.,"Hi all. Me again. I know some folks in this sub followed my various posts over the past several months, and so I wanted to provide an update. Now just waiting on the bureaucracy and legalities of the court system. Divorce should be finalized sometime early in the new year.

The cliffnotes version: Finally left my abusive husband, who also had a serious hoarding problem. We've gone through mediation. Since I was the breadwinner, my two primary concerns were having to pay him alimony, or half my 401K. To make a VERY long story short, I don't have to pay him a dime in alimony, nor a penny out of my 401K, and I was also able to negotiate for 70% of the equity from the sale of the house. 

For those of you unfamiliar with my story/circumstances: I was married to my abusive soon-to-be-ex-husband for nine years. In addition to being abusive and having a laundry list of issues (anger, excessive drinking, chronic unemployment, and financial irresponsibility), he also had a serious hoarding problem. We previously lived in a 4,000+ sq ft house. Even when ""we"" (read: I) prepared to sell the house, he barely lifted a finger, so the task of clearing out his 2,500+ sq ft of hoards fell on my shoulders, even though I was working full-time while also dealing with chemotherapy, monthly immunotherapy infusions, and recovery from annual surgeries for my autoimmune condition. I did as much as I could independently, but I did have to hire professional junk removal crews on several occasions, which was several thousand $ out of pocket. Costly, but worth every penny. I cried tears of relief as I watched them haul stuff away.

I found myself a lovely new (rental) condo. It's half the size of the former house, around ~1,200 sq ft, 1bd/1ba, so everything is very spacious. It's been the perfect space to start my healing from the trauma of being married to and leaving a hoarder. It's in the heart of the city, GREAT price (secured garage parking included!),  tons of amenities, floor-to-ceiling windows, walk-out patio, spacious kitchen with island, in-unit washer/dryer, walk-in closet, the whole nine yards. And best of all, it's CLEAN and TIDY and ORGANIZED! üòÑüòäü•∞ My landlady is also amazing, and is like the big sister I never had. 

I took some much-needed vacation last month, too, and it was my first *proper* and *genuine* vacation in a decade. I visited New England, and then flew out west to attend a professional conference and to visit with long-time family friends. I was in a very dark headspace before the vacation, so getting away from the grind and stress of life made a world of difference for my mental health. 

I'm still in therapy to deal with the emotional fall-out of everything. Prior to going on vacation, I felt like an emotional yo-yo on an hourly basis. Felt like the crying would never end. Since coming back from vacation, I've been doing better. I'm still in therapy, and I still have dark days/moments, but I've made substantial leaps of progress in the past ~90 days or so.

I regret nothing! I'm embarrassed slightly but this is too funny not to share. (A wrapping paper confession),"There have been a couple posts and many comments about wrapping paper for obvious reasons.

I'm going to share with you something I learned tonight. Tonight I learned from this process - I regret nothing. 

I found a roll of wrapping paper at Dollar tree this year. I recycled my laundry hamper container of wrapping paper that was elves and santas and reindeer as well as in January of 2023. 

All those off cuts were gone. Those ""I can reuse it"" pieces I saved? Gone. 

In march I needed something for a retirement present. I am a dollar tree junkie (The mint chocolate cookies they carry are Girl Scout Thin Mints and are a problem) so I decided to pick up a roll there.

  
I found something I thought was unique but also universal. It was dark blue with stars and constellations. It was PERFECT.

  
I have been using that roll since March. It has wrapped birthday gifts, wedding gifts, all kinds of stuff. 

  
Tonight I was wrapping up some last minute things and my DH started laughing.

""You have no idea, do you?""

What?

""Have you looked at that wrapping paper?""

Yes. It's constellations and stuff. Why? \*insert me being snarky\* Are you saying my dear Mother In Law is going to think I'm evil because I gave her a Christmas present wrapped in a constellation map and that means I am going to hell because Zodiac symbols are pagan? 

""No. I'm telling you to look at the constellations. Look at the connect the dots.""

Y'all. I looked at the paper. Yes. It's dark blue. Yes. There are stars. Yes. There are constellations. The constellations are?

DRUMMM ROLL PLEASE............. Dinosaurs.

I have spent almost a year giving gifts wrapped in SPACE DINOSAUR STAR CHARTS

My word of advice? Chuck the Santa paper. Go for something quirky. It'll be the best decision you've ever made. 

Monday I'm going to hand my PITA MIL a plastic container with 32 different kinds of seeds so she can start a garden this spring wrapped in......... wrapping paper designed by someone who was really really really high at work. And I'm going to giggle because she'll never notice.

I didn't, after all.",declutter,1703407489.0

every single thing you own has to be taken care of, just like a pet. 

you already bought it. it is already in your house. do not think about how much it was or how unique it is. if it is not serving you, then you are serving it.

more stuff means more time and energy organizing. is having this stuff worth the amount of sunk time and energy? TIME IS LITERALLY PRICELESS, SO HAVE SOME PERSPECTIVE

do you want 10 cute sweaters that are all pilling because you cant take care of them all, or 2 really nice sweaters you can upkeep?

do you want to waste time deciding which lotion/skincare product to use every single day?

do you want to take care of mounds of stuff or have time to rest/have fun/work on yourself?

less stuff = faster clean up

less stuff = more time saved

less stuff = room for possibilities

Dealing with Overflow of Husband's Stuff,"I wouldn't say I'm a super-clean person, but clutter definitely gets to me. I get anxious when items accumulate and I feel satisfaction in getting rid of things I don't use. My husband is generally clean and organized, but he has a lot of hobbies, and he doesn't like getting rid of things. I love that he has so many different passions (he's not a pick-it-up-and-put-it-down-2-months-later dude‚Äîhe commits) but it feels like items related to his interests leak all over the house. 

What I find most frustrating is the kitchen. I do the majority of the cooking, but our counter space and table are frequently covered in items related to his projects. This makes me not want to start making a meal or use these spaces. We both have offices, and my thinking is: our stuff stays in our offices. (I don't care at all what his office looks like.) Some of my frustration certainly comes from feeling like he has free reign of the house while I compress my own belongings into a small space.   
  
I guess my question is: is it fair of me to ask that he contain his hobby-centric tools/vessels/etc. to his office? I get insecure that I'm unfairly trying to maintain my individual level of tidiness, while of course we both live in this home. I wouldn't mind him using the kitchen and other parts of the home for certain projects if the paraphernalia were just put away after. ",declutter,1736306467.0
I'm a pack rat but my husband is a full-blown hoarder. I feel stuck even finding a starting point to declutter. Help!,"(First time post on Reddit, I think ever. On mobile, hopefully the formatting doesn't come through as a wall of text.) 

I've always been a bit of a pack rat (and ADHD), but I had gotten a lot of support from family and friends, and I had found some success at keeping a tidy home and getting rid of stuff like clothes I was no longer wearing. My stuff fit in my space and generally looked nice and orderly (although it wasn't perfect). I still had stashes of things I didn't really need, things like a tote box of things I haven't even looked at in 20 years, or a pile of small cardboard boxes for ""just in case I needed to mail something."" 

Then I got married. Seven years later, my husband doesn't even like it when I throw out clothes that have gotten holes in them, because they hold sentimental value for him. There are issues of trauma from his past that make it painful for him to let go of things. So I feel like I have to sneak throwing away even my own clothes that wouldn't even be good enough to donate. He saves stuff like used jars and Ziploc bags and other stuff that I had put into the trash. His house before I married him was so stuffed that he said you had to turn sideways to get through the small path through the living room to get between the front door and the kitchen. I thought love would help him and he would not do this again. Famous last words. 

We have accumulated so much stuff in seven years, and I don't even know exactly how it happened. We used to be able to fit two cars in our garage. Now it is filled side to side, front to back, stacked higher than my head. Our wheelbarrow sat outside in the elements all summer because we couldn't find a spot for it in the garage. 

We built a 12 x 20 foot storage shed in the back yard to hold boxes of stuff, and now it's filled front to back, stacked higher than my head, and there's not even aisles to walk in to get to the stuff in the back. 

All the closets and cabinets and drawers in the house are full to overflowing. We have nice stuff that is *who knows where* so we don't even get to enjoy the use of it on those occasions that we would be presumably ""saving it for"" if we were debating whether to get rid of it. 

I'm afraid the house is next on the list of becoming a full-blown hoarder house. I'm holding that at bay, or at least I'm trying... But I was trying to hold it at bay with the garage, too, and I lost that battle. 

This past weekend I tried to just take on a small thing - the top of my dresser - and I got the surface cleared off and the mirror washed. That felt really good, but it's already stacked again with piles of excess clothes that didn't have anywhere else to go. 

Two years ago, I was in tears on Christmas Day because I felt so hopeless over how bad everything had gotten. A year ago, I was so angry about it, I told my husband I felt like burning it all down, and he promised me he would work on it, but nothing ever happened. Feels like I'm going through the stages of grief here, LOL! 

I feel stuck and lost and completely inadequate to know how to tackle this. But the clutter is taking a toll on my mental health and I really want to fix this. Help! Has anyone been in a similar situation? 

Any tips or advice? Is this possible or is it a lost cause? Any ideas on how to make progress and not constantly get discouraged by setbacks? ",declutter,1736306955.0
I'm ashamed and overwhelmed by my clutter,"As a young adult I was an unintentional minimalist. I moved frequently and had very little disposable income, so everything I owned fit into a few suitcases. I remember feeling like the king of the world when I finally bought myself a bed and a sofa to go in my first solo apartment. Having my own furniture in my own space was such a big deal. No more rented bunks or shared rooms. Financial stability was so liberating! I went a little crazy buying and collecting all the things I couldn't have before, and there was no one to tell me not to.

Fast forward a decade and I now feel paralyzed by all the things that once brought me so much joy to acquire. I feel like there is stuff everywhere just gathering dust. I have stacks of books that don't fit on shelves, clothes without drawers or hangers, half finished projects, gadgets, and knick knacks in every room. I don't know if it's actually as bad as I've built up in my head, but I look at all this STUFF and just see money that was once so hard to come by and I could have used more wisely. Getting rid of anything feels like throwing that money away, but I can't keep it all!  
  
I used to love hosting and now I avoid having people over because I feel like I need to hide all the clutter. This includes my lovely partner of several years, who has never even seen my bedroom because it's hiding my mess. I always find excuses for us to stay at her home instead. I very much see myself spending my life with her, and we're seriously talking about buying a home together. But I know in order to do this I'm going to have to tackle the issue of the clutter. I've started picking away at it, trying to sell or donate things here and there, but it's been a very slow process and I keep getting overwhelmed and frustrated. Any advice on how to tackle this once and for all?",declutter,1736317373.0
Overwhelmed with shorts collection ,"I have a massive collection of shorts that I've accumulated since 2022. I would estimate somewhere between 100-150 pairs in my closet and under my bed.

I live in a warmer climate where I am outside a lot and go to the gym at least four days a week. So naturally I wear shorts for most occasions. However, my problem is that whenever I purchase a type of pair, I get it in multiple colors to match with different tops. I have all kinds of fits and inseams depending on how I want to look at the moment.

I now have no room in my closet because of this habit. This has been an unhealthy obsession of mine that I am now addressing and eager to fix. But I'm currently going through my collection feeling overwhelmed and defeated.

Sad that I‚Äôve lost sentimental items in clutter,"Little over a year ago, I moved into my current place. I didn‚Äôt realize how much clutter I‚Äôd built up till I had to move.

It was so overwhelming when we moved all of my boxes into my current apartment because nothing was separated or labeled.

Now that I‚Äôm moving again, I‚Äôm actually taking the time to declutter. However, as I‚Äôm finally unpacking all of my clutter to downsize and move into a new place, I‚Äôm finding that I may have lost some very sentimental belongings, and I‚Äôm struggling to push through the sadness and guilt.

Kids Stuffies What to Do?,"So, my 8 year old daughter has a ton of stuffies. For the most part she can remember where and who she got them from. She has 6 or 7 on the bed, three under the bed trays full, a small hanging bang on the back of her bedroom door, and a big basket of them.

We don‚Äôt try to buy her anymore, and we‚Äôve communicated to relatives to not buy anymore for holidays etc.

I have tried to work with her to get rid of some but she gets super upset.

I don‚Äôt want her to be a hoarder later in life, but I don‚Äôt want to unnecessarily traumatize her now.

I figure she will stop wanting stuffies in the next few years anyways.

Update on my clothes n clutter situation,"https://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/s/JiOvyDFWoz copied my other post! 

But I‚Äôve officially conquered my scary cluttered room. I‚Äôve got 5 boxes of stuff to donate and three bags and I had two bags earlier this week as well. Every time I‚Äôve cleaned out in the past 6 months (about 5 times) I‚Äôve had 2 garbage bags full of stuff to donate. It‚Äôs been insane. Idk how I have so much stuff. I am looking into renting a storage unit for some larger stuff I plan to keep as I genuinely don‚Äôt have room for them bc I live with family still but they‚Äôre pieces I love. 


I also want to say whoever commented the tip that when you buy something donate 1-3 (?) objects similar well that has helped so much. I got a pair of brand new winter boots I‚Äôve been searching for forever for at a thrift store and donated 4 pairs of shoes when I got home üòä.

Do you think the way you were raised impacted your desire to declutter?,"I enjoy cleaning and organizing my space and do not hesitate to throw away /give away/ recycle most of the things (more difficult with clothes and accessories). Every time I realize that I have an expired hand cream I'd instantly throw it away

And I think this desire to clean, declutter and organize came from the fact that I grew up in the opposite conditions. My mom would keep everything, even empty shampoo bottles, broken matches, creams that are years old etc. I have always been annoyed by it, like its amazing if your stuff can get a second life and make someone else happy or you can recycle it for the planet's good. But some things are just...trash?

It'd never turn into drastic piles but she'd have ""slashes"" all over the flat.

When I was moving to another country I couldn't bring a lot of stuff with me, but I also didn't want it to collect dust at my mom's place. So I had one of the biggest declutters of my life, when I got rid of 3 bags of different things. She wasn't happy, but I knew it was for good.

Having a good place to donate makes it a lot easier to let go,"I've been going through my sewing room in preparation of a big project that I've been putting off for at least a year (maybe two) - so maybe more procrastination than anything.  BUT we have a free community Craft Closet in our town and I donated a bunch of do-dads last weekend.  

Yesterday, I was talking to my neighbor who was telling me about the Craft Closet (in case I didn't know) and how she got a bunch of really nice ribbon and a whole jar of safety pins.  That was me!  That was my ribbon!  And those were my safety pins!  

So I just went back through my sewing drawers and pulled out even more things to donate - if she thought that stuff was good, she'll probably love what I thought were ""keepers.""  I'm going to send her a text to take whatever she wants and then I'll donate the rest.

It's so easy to collect ""could be handy,"" ""maybe someday"" hobby stuff - some of it is super-cool, let's base a whole project around it - but some of it (maybe most of it) is pretty pedestrian (or was just on sale/clearance).

Staying motivated for decluttering ,"I'm posting because I figured a public place can help me stay focused. In November a friend posted on FB about wanting to declutter. After a conversation we ended up creating a FB group for us (there's 4/5) and are now meeting virtually weekly to help each other stay on task and just be accountable. We all seem to have ADHD in some form, so the virtual person is helpful for body doubling. Today we're meeting again for the first time this year (our kids have started school again). I'm excited to tackle the Lego and bins we have in our family room upstairs. It'll be more organization as they've been pulled out then removal but every journey begins with a first step.

Clearing out wardrobe - feeling wasteful!,"I've committed to a no buy 2025 for clothes! I'm really excited to commit to it. Now I begin to declutter what I already have, however I find it really hard to clear out without feeling wasteful.

It's all the boring pieces, not the special/interesting pieces.

I have things that I don't use often (ie. so many plain colour t-shirts and long sleeve tees, scarves, pajamas) but I feel like I shouldn't get rid of. For example, I mostly wear black and white tees (useful for casual wear, office wear etc) but I have so many different coloured tees that I just don't wear, but then also feels wasteful to get rid of. Same with pajamas - so many old PJs that are still good in rotation but I don't need so many sleep singlets. Long sleeve tees - I live somewhere that's cold for 6 months of the year and have so many long sleeve tees, good for layers, but I only ever really wear the same 3-4 on rotation. But then it feels wasteful to get rid of perfectly good things! Like I feel like I should keep them for when the ones I wear all the time wear out. But realistically I should just get rid of them and then in a few years when I need to replace something, I can just replace whatever I need to.

Can anyone relate? How did you move past it? Thanks!",declutter,1736468256.0

Should I save old veterinary bills?,"I decided to sort through my file folders today and I found a *mountain* of old vet bills, probably every single bill for every single vet visit from 2017 forward.  I have absolutely no idea why I started saving them in the first place, it's just something I've always done, and Google wasn't much help, so I thought I'd ask you guys!

So, is there any reason I might need to keep the bills for my living cats?  Half the bills are for cats who crossed the Rainbow Bridge at least 3 1/2 years ago and obviously they can go, but the bills for my living cats do detail the treatments they received, and that seems like it might be useful information.

I'm finally doing a big paper declutter and it's such a relief,"I'm finally doing the paper declutter I started and abandoned several years ago. I was working through the Marie Kondo method and got rid of a lot of books and clothes etc but found the paper decluttering to be endless and overwhelming.

I had a health scare last year that reminded me how short life is and to just get on with things I need and want to do. The paper clutter was making me feel overwhelmed, confused, anxious and depressed because it was lots of paper from old courses, unfinished projects, old bills etc. Stuff I'd not looked at in several years and didn't need but the process of going through it all always felt like a 'some other day' job when other things felt more important.

I have managed to work through lots of it in the past two weeks, I just have a few more drawers to go through. My recycling bin is already full and I've had to empty the shredder already. Our council gives us a small paper recycling bin and a big 'tins and bottles' recycling bin, I have fed back to them during their recent consultation that a big paper recycling bin would be much more helpful since the paper recycling bin gets full quickly of things like cereal boxes and envelopes etc. I think the small paper recycling bin was actually one reason I'd been delaying getting rid of all the paper (I can't drive at the moment due to an injury so I can't drive to the local recycling centre).",declutter,1736515355.0
Declutter guilt / personalized items,"I just moved and after moving I realized how much unnecessary stuff I have. Especially clothes bc I find myself wearing the same things.

Friday 15: T-shirts!,"This week, it's time to tackle the T-shirt monster! T-shirts tend to breed because (a) they're useful garments and (b) they're the go-to memorabilia for every band, 10k, high school musical, and other event. Thanks to u/Live_Butterscotch928 for suggesting this one.

Pull out all your T-shirts! The first step is a simple sort into:

1. Wear shirt: these are any T-shirts that you regularly wear, or that are similar to ones you regularly wear but got lost in the back of a drawer. Graphic T-shirts that you regularly wear belong in this stack.
2. Memento shirts: these are T-shirts you don't intend to wear (or could wear but never do), but you still feel sentimental attachments.
3. Why shirts: these are any T-shirts where you have no idea why you still own them. These are going straight to fabric recycling, donations, or trash, depending on condition!

Now, the first two categories get different treatments.

For **Wear Shirts**, the goal is to keep enough shirts for your regular laundry routine plus a couple days and maybe a few unusual occasions. Every shirt should fit, be in good repair, be a flattering color, go with your other clothes, and not annoy you when you're wearing it. If there are 50 shirts that meet these criteria, keep the *best* ones. (If you are hard to fit, a deeper bench is justified. You may want to store back-up shirts separately.) Remember, Wear Shirts include graphic tees that you actually wear! 

Your **Memento Shirts** are not going back in the drawer with Wear Shirts. Here's where we face the hard question of whether the shirts are actually acting as mementos. If they're stuck in a drawer or a box somewhere, where you're never looking at them, then they're not really eliciting fond memories. Pick an approach that makes the memories present in your life. You can frame the best graphics. Everyone always suggests a T-shirt quilt or pillow. You can put photos in your album. You can choose the best three T-shirts and keep them in the Wear Shirt drawer so they make you smile when you open it. 

In the comments, share your favorite stories that a graphic T-shirt reminds you of!",declutter,1736515941.0

Decluttering Disappointment,"How do you deal emotionally with decluttering items you know you need to replace?

At the start of December, my family and I went through our kitchen, and basically did a whole clean out of everything to figure out what we didn‚Äôt/couldn‚Äôt use anymore. 

Some of it was legitimately good progress, like the cooking pans that have bits flaking off, the wooden utensils, a cutlery set we don‚Äôt use, etc. 

But one part in particular was a hard blow. We had a whole cupboard full of reusable water bottles, that has had to go in the trash, because they all grew mold. We‚Äôre talking 20+ bottles btw. Now matter what we did, we just couldn‚Äôt get rid of it (dishwasher, hand scrubbing, vinegar soaks, bleach, google hacks), so in the bin they went. Some of them were well over ten years old, so they didn‚Äôt owe us anything, but now we‚Äôre looking to essentially replace them all, and it just feels like such a waste.

Logically, I know, that interacting with mold is bad, so they HAD to go, but replacing them is going to be frustrating, and I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to get over that resentment and disappointment. Any tips? Also, if anyone has any brand recommendations, literally the only requirement is that it‚Äôs dishwasher safe. Thanks! ",declutter,1736528845.0
Small collections may help you declutter further,"Does anyone else really appreciate curated, small collections? I find it a bummer when someone shows off massive collections as I feel it's no longer about having things that bring you happiness, it's about showing off how much money you spent. It also just doesn't look as nice. I love seeing peoples small, curated collections of whatever thing they're into, each piece selected for a specific reason. But when I see massive ""hauls"" or collections online it just starts to look like...stuff. 

Just a thought I have as I've been very anti clutter for years and have recently started carefully, thoughtfully letting myself collect a couple things (physical movies and a certain small doll that starts with fadudu which also go with my existing weird creature collection). But I'm being sure to be mindful to only buy the ones that I will truly appreciate and enjoy AND have a designated place for. 

My tip I'm sharing today as, I've been big on decluttering for a while, is to allow yourself a few things that you keep not because it has a function but because it brings you joy to see it. Then you will realize the clutter around it is distracting from the things you want to highlight, thus encouraging you to pair down and/or avoid buying things you don't truly love or need.

Don‚Äôt Worry About Documenting; Just Do It,"Story time! My New Year‚Äôs resolution was decluttering. My goal was to declutter an item a day, so I‚Äôd at the least have gotten 365 things out of my house. I set a daily habit on Hello Habit (an app) to ‚Äúdeclutter‚Äù at 9 AM. I set the rule that I could put as many items as I wanted in my donation area on any day, not limited to one item. I also like data, so I started a spreadsheet to show what I was donating; I was curious what my biggest category would be, or if I had any trends I could identify.

On January 8, I gave up on tracking. Each morning, I‚Äôd look for something to give away, or trash, and that would take about 30 seconds. Then I would immediately see something in the same drawer, and put that aside, too. And then I‚Äôd realize, you know, I am uncomfortable in this itchy sweater, so it should be donated, too. I don‚Äôt have ADHD or anything, but I‚Äôd just catch the bug every time and realize I didn‚Äôt want to stop decluttering to update my spreadsheet.

What was I going to do with this data, anyway? I‚Äôd make one post here showing my findings, and then I‚Äôd forget about it. My time is better spent just continuing to declutter, post to my Buy Nothing group, and find better homes for the things I just don‚Äôt use.

I want to give things away but this weekend isn't a good time and I don't want to hold on to these items with the idea that eventually I'll give them away. ,declutter,1736652895.0
My house is a work in progress,"Not a complete success story yet, but I am working on it. I started decluttering Thursday night by going through 2 cabinets and a closet in my office/dog room. I then started going through all of my clothes,  throwing out what was stained or not in good shape, and putting most of what doesn't fit in laundry bags for goodwill. I am now up to 3 full laundry bags, and also have a large duffel bag full of other things to donate. I still have more to go through tomorrow, but I've pulled a lot of it out into the open so that I have to deal with it sooner rather than later.

"I have accepted the need to declutter clothes due to an upcoming move, and could really use more motivational tips after some initial progress!","Background: I'm an avid thrifter who needs tall sizing, and I've spent a decade finding pieces that fit my body that couldn't easily be purchased new. I have 3 generously sized closets, a dresser, 4 bins of underbed storage, and 4 other large bins totally filled with clothes and shoes.


Now that I know I will be moving in 2 months to a place with much less storage, I've been trying to ruthlessly pare down to moderate success. Using some of the mindsets I've read here, this is the approximate progress I've made:


* 75 long sleeve shirts to 50
* 40 pairs of shoes to 25 
* 70 t-shirts to 55 
* 40 pairs of pants to 30 
* 40 dresses to 25 
* 35 skirts to 20
* 20 shorts to 10 
* 60 coats/jackets to 40
* 30 sweaters to 20
* An uncounted number of scarves, belts, bras, handbags, swimwear.


Now, this is still clearly way more than a single person needs, but I'm getting to the point where it's getting really tough to let go of anything else. 


Can you please tell me I'm doing okay so far, and help motivate me/suggest tips to keep going? My mom recently said that I shouldn't declutter too much since it'd likely be anxiety-driven about moving to a smaller space and I've worked so hard to find all these things, and hearing that really slowed me down!

(I‚Äôm new-) how to avoid just ‚Äòshuffling deck chairs on the titanic‚Äô?,"So the bookshelf in our living room has been a stashing place for like 5 years. This week my husband rescued a box of books- almost 100 year old dictionary and reference texts that he finds interesting. I sort of rather not fill our house with that ‚Äòjust to have‚Äô but I can empathize so fine. That led to him spending an hour and a half tearing up the living room bookshelf to make space to get them off the floor. A few things were pitched like old receipts. 

Many things I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do with like hard copy souvenir photos from the beach last summer that maybe one day we will frame and put up on the wall. So I just carried that to a guest bedroom shelf for now. The biggest issue is that when we moved in, my husband wanted to repaint the built in shelves in the office because the knots were showing. So all my many fantasy novels etc are in piles on the guest room floor. It felt bad shuffling books from the living room bookshelf to the guest room floor. I have no idea when he will get to that.

The problem is that I love all my stuff and am having trouble decluttering. I own so many figures that I'm finding it hard to keep up with dusting them and it stresses me out. Most are still in their boxes (The boxes themselves take up a lot of space too).

I also own a lot of clothes as my weight fluctuates. The clothes that don't currently fit me are in bins outside of my room. I'm afraid of getting rid of them if I ever get to that weight again. I was unwell at the time of owning them, and am wondering if I should rid of them solely based on that (that weight wasn't good for me).

Declutter win: pared down my mementos/photos from two large bins to one shoebox sized basket.,"I got a new bed frame and this forced me to tackle the demons lurking under my bed: boxes of mementos and a whole bunch of random stuff and Chernobyl sized dust bunnies. I'd been avoiding it for the longest time but the bed purchase sort of forced my hand.

I had two of those long boxes designed to fit under beds full of stuff and went through all of it and got rid of duplicate photos and photos of people that aren't a part of my life, exes and on and on. I have one shoebox sized box full of stuff now. 

My new bed has a higher clearance under it so I am going to be able to store seasonal stuff like my Christmas tree/decorations/wrapping paper under there now and after decluttering, it's going to feel like I have SO MUCH SPACE.

Y'all, I have a small condo, 930 sq ft with my two kids. And I think by the time I am decluttering I will actually have *unused space*.

I never thought it possible and that has been fueling me in my decluttering work.",declutter,1736710584.0
Finally cleared another box of sentimental childhood items,"I only moved items taking up 7 linear feet of trailer to my current home. 

It's not because my home is small. In fact, it's 3 residences taking up over 5K sqft., with 2.5K sqft carriage house, and a full basement that had 2 illegal apartments in it. I could store and keep as much as I like.

It's not because I didn't have much. I've had plenty. It's simply that I've learned over the years that very little is worth moving. There is ""stuff"" every where you go. It's not expensive if you know where to look. It's easier than at any point in history to acquire ""stuff.""

So the items I moved were those things that really mattered to me. The most sentimental.

I went looking for memento from college to take a picture and share with a friend. Because I didn't find it initially, I opened an old box marked ""childhood dolls and photos."" To be clear, I thought I had already opened and stored ""childhood dolls."" I have them stored in an armoire, and get them out occasionally for visiting children to play with. I also had a box of unsorted pictures from my grandmother's albums and ones I had taken with my camera as a little girl. Imagine my surprise when I found MORE handmade dolls (HomeEc projects that I don't have sentimental attachment to), and a lot of rubbish photos to trash. In all, I found 2 small handmade items to store with the rest in the armoire, and reduced the photos to a small box that held only the pictures and moments I felt sentimental about. The dolls are lovely and worth donating. The rest went into the trash. 

Even with the 7 linear feet of items I moved, I have decluttered 2 boxes of sentimental items; I've decluttered bags of clothing (new climate, new time of life, wardrobe updates, etc.); I still haven't filled the rolling stainless steel tool chest; I've donated one of the 3 dish sets I brought; And I'm still holding onto a sideboard I plan to turn into a sink basin in a room up next to renovate.

This box had clearly not been opened in over 25 years. I recognized the label and know it was a labeling style I used early in my first marriage. I think it's made at least 7 moves since it was last taped up. I am pretty good about going through things, but I only do what I have time and energy to do. So it has taken me this long to get to it.

It was an absolute delight to see all of these items. I had a great time going through the box. My partner urged me to NOT declutter anything (his family are hoarders with the property and inclination to go far past what most people are capable of). 

And yet, I know if I kept those items, the chances are it might be another 25 years or more before I saw them again. At that point I'd be quite advanced in years. My kids would only care about the few photos and handmade items I kept. I would be keeping things I'd never see, look at, or remember. Keeping them for someone else to have to trash in a distant future. I felt such peace enjoying them one more time, and then moving them on.

That appliance (talking bout you air frier) that goes viral, then you just don't use. 

If you could totally plan your kitchen from scratch, what would you put near your stove, fridge and sink areas?  Would food all be in one cabinet area, or would you put baking stuff by the stove, cereals near the fridge, etc.?

The goal is to plan it out and declutter before we move so we aren't moving extra stuff and also so we can take stuff straight from boxes and into cabinets on the other end.

I try to ensure everything in our house has a home. But besides going to the ""one in, one out rule"", is decluttering a lifetime commitment?

Helping my mom declutter in February.,"As long as I remember my mother has difficulties with throwing away stuff. I wouldn‚Äôt call her a hoarder but the stuff that was in the house rarely left the house. After my grandmother (her mother) died she took over a lot of the stuff from her to ‚Äòsave it‚Äôs (her brother just wanted to throw everything away). Since three years now she has the house for herself after me and my siblings moved out. 

In conversations I‚Äôve had with her last year she admits more and more that she wished that she would succeed in decluttering the house completely because she is realising that this isn‚Äôt a nice house to live in and she feels shame about all the stuff in the house. 

Last Christmas my two siblings and I gifted to her that I would come to her house an entire week (I live quite far) to help her clean everything together with my two siblings. 

But I know if I don‚Äôt have a proper strategy we most definitely will not succeed in helping her.

Things I already thought of are making an appointment with the local second hand warehouse to pick up a lot of stuff (so she will know the stuff will not be burned or destroyed and that will help with letting go certain things) and renting a large container in front of the house for al the stuff that‚Äôs already broken.

The advice I‚Äôm looking for are ways to let her have the feeling that she ‚Äòsaw‚Äô everything and that she has the feeling that she can co-decide what happens with which stuff but that we still can move forward and don‚Äôt waste too much time.

Advice for closet decluttering mind blocks,"Would love some advice on decluttering my trouble spot: my closet. I have two main blocks:

Decluttering as someone who is low income ‚Äî getting over the ‚Äúbut what if I actually need this‚Äù trap,"**TLDR: If you are having trouble getting rid of things** **because you are also low income and worry that you**
**wont be able to replace it if you do need it in the** **future, I‚Äôve found success in relying on community** **for those ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios.**


I have a modest salary, and every month I have to carefully budget to make ends meet. With my career trajectory, I have spent all of my 20s and will spend most of my 30s making minimum wage in a HCOL area. 

A large part of my clutter is due to inability to let things go because of the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenario. If something comes up, I realize I likely will not be able to afford to purchase the item again. For example vegetable peelers. I have one that works fairly well and a second one that is kinda awful that I got for free 5 years ago‚Ä¶ but what if the good one breaks? Better to have a bad vegetable peeler than no vegetable peeler, right? And anytime I see something for free that seems like it could be useful?? You bet I picked that up and stored it away for a rainy day. Same with sleeping bags. I love to camp, and have one sleeping bag I love, and 3 sleeping bags that I got for free that I nestle in each other when I winter camp because I can‚Äôt afford a 4 season bag yet. Do I actually nestle when I winter camp? No I borrow my friend‚Äôs bag. But what if???

My perspective changed during my last move and an apartment flood. I had to rent a storage unit, which I certainly couldn‚Äôt afford, to house all this stuff that it turns out I really didn‚Äôt need or miss that much. And the items I did miss? I had absolutely no way of getting to given that my storage locker was filled floor to ceiling with unlabeled boxes. When I cooked in my temporary housing, I didn‚Äôt have a vegetable peeler, or a garlic press, or a mixing bowl, or really anything to cook with. I was lamenting this during lunch and do you know what a coworker said? ‚ÄúI meal prep so I don‚Äôt really use my kitchen stuff during the week. Let me know what you need and I‚Äôll bring it in tomorrow.‚Äù

This coworker, who I‚Äôm close with, but certainly not besties with, let me borrow their one vegetable peeler, one garlic press, one bowl, special pan, etc. I used it for a few days, cleaned it, and brought it back. And so I continued for the weeks that I was living in temporary housing. 

This whole experience made me realize it really is okay to rely on community in the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios. 1000% it‚Äôs okay to keep everything you need on the daily and maybe a backup, but all of those ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios? For the I-can‚Äôt-afford-another-if-it-turns-out-I-needed-this scenarios? It‚Äôs okay to rely on community to help you out. 

I‚Äôm slowly in the process of decluttering about 50% of my possessions. It feels good to find loving homes for my items on buy nothing groups. With the mental clarity that comes with empty drawers, free hangers, etc I am much more able to invest in my community. I actively seek out ways to help others with my possessions, and I feel confident knowing this energy will come back around if I‚Äôm in need again. Currently I have friends borrowing some of my Tupperwares as well as my volleyball. 

I also feel that asking for and giving help is a wonderful way to feel more connected to people and our communities. I really feel that corporations are the only ones that benefit from this hyper-independent ‚Äúyou must have every item you could possibly need‚Äù mentality. 

Also my modest income still allows me to buy 2 or 3 ‚Äúbuy it for life‚Äù items a year. Borrowing items I need in a pinch vs buying cheap frees up money so I can intentionally spend on things that I believe will have the greatest impact on my day to day life. ",declutter,1736794093.0

"Started yesterday, made a microscopic dent in Mess","Quick background. twice in the past 15-20 years-had professionals come in to clean my house. Between jan of 24 and now it devolved into the worst it's ever been. Not only clutter but filth.  I know how it happened-depression very bad over past year, perhaps some COVID effects on depression and stamina. I can't use my kitchen or my refrigerator, have kind of been backed into a spot in my den where I sleep, and eat. Take out every day for dinner-horrible. I also think there are some health issues impacting my ability to function-probably have sleep apnea-tired all the time. and the depression. For those of you who don't get it the analogy I use is that it's like you are telling me that I need to jump from one side of the Grand Canyon to the other. I literally feel physically paralyzed with fear and panic.

The last time I had the clutter people in, I think Jan of 24? this is stupid, but they took a bunch of stuff that was in my foyer, shoes-some very dirty on bottom,  purses, bags with stuff, and tossed them in the bottom of my tiny coat closet at end of day. I wanted to tell them we had to go through that  b4 they left, but at that point just wanted them to be gone. (It's not that they didn't do a good job-somehow scrubbed my kitchen to a shine, but it's just emotionally exhausting), staring at that pile got me so stressed out (this isn't an excuse just a description of how I felt) that I became paralyzed staring at it every day. And down I went. Had COVID again in May. Afterward, started leaving fast food bags and containers all over the place-why? My garbage can needed a cleaning! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I have every type of cleaning thing-great vacuum, steam mop, small steam cleaner, all kinds of disinfecting cleaners, mops etc, hoping would inspire but paralyzed.

OK that's the background. Yesterday I was determined to start-I am petrified that something will happen in my house that requires emergency maintenance, OR i GET SICK, and how will I let anyone IN. I started in living room put on TV-something suspenseful, put on a mask and gloves and got the garbage bags. Started with garbage on surfaces and anything else to be thrown out-but didn't do any putting away-moved downward to all the crap on the floor. (Seriously, I don't know who I am anymore.) Panicky that it took more than I imagined, and got significantly less done in an hour that I thought I would- but kept trying to push that to back of mind.  Also tossed stuff that I would ordinarily put away or think about giving away but I overthink everything so into garbage it went. Included dirty dishes because can't use kitchen.  

Worked for an hour and a half then made self stop. Filled a giant contractor bag that I started putting in garbage early summer(!) plus three standard kitchen bags. Took one to a can on a street corner (big plastic bin. Later while upstairs (One bedroom townhome about 1550 sq ft.) I gathered recycling from unwrapping/wrapping gifts -tissue paper, delivery boxes etc.   Washed clothes that were on floor and in a basket from early last year. FYI clean clothes draped all over.

I am so humiliated and overthink so much that just putting out the garbage stresses me out. In a townhome complex garbage day cans are out in front of our homes-I stress over neighbors wondering what the F- I have so much garbage/recycling for-and some are very nosy. Have had the same garbage men for a while--stress over what THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT MY GARBAGE! So I try to toss some at my mom's house some at work, even this stresses me out.

Anyway, just needed to share and looking for any advice. I have not provided too many details on the filthy part of this because just can't handle sharing that right now. I have to say, I find this ""group"" in Reddit much less judgemental than some other online options, maybe better moderated, and more people willing to be supportive.

Advice for Drastic Downsizing/Decluttering and Mental Exhaustion from Decision Making?,"I'd considered myself a minimalist in ""maintenance mode"" for many years, but I'm really struggling (for more than a year now) to declutter after drastically downsizing due to economic hardship. My three children and I are currently living in a tiny basement apartment (about 500 sq ft). I imagine how freeing it would be to just throw everything out, but when I try to take action, it is so time consuming and mentally/emotionally exhausting to try and get rid of anything. Financial insecurity is definitely a hurdle. I feel like if I get rid of something, I will not be able to replace it if needed.

Some examples:   
\- I don't regularly use all my pots/pans/kitchen items, but what about the one time a year I do?  
Maybe it would help to consider what I've used in the past year or envision what would happen if I didn't have this item? I saw a great recent post about leaning on community, but that's not really a good solution for me currently.

\- My 8 and 10 year old sons have more clothes than they need, but they are also very rough on their clothes. I'm often mending clothes due to holes. Or washing out stains/mud/etc. I'm afraid of them not having enough if I get rid of extras. Maybe it would help to decide how many of each item we actually need? I'd love to get rid of some of the sweatshirts/jackets.

\- Blankets! We have too many blankets, until the cold nights when my entire family goes through multiple sets of bedding and blankets due to the stomach flu (has happened more than once).

Starting from the bottom... Help ,"Hi all.. I'm a person with a lot of stuff. A neuro divergent trait of mine is discovering a new hobby/enjoyment, and absolutely going to town on it and accumulating loads of stuff related to it. As such I share a two bed flat with my fiance that is absolutely full to the brim of stuff.. a hobby graveyard of sorts.

Now a lot of the things I've accumulated, I love. For instance most of my crafts, my dolls, my Japanese art books. Some stuff, not so much. I have so many soft toys of various brands that I bought on impulse when I was younger that now just fill me with regret. 

I'm currently on annual leave from work and we have been trying to sort some of the stuff out. I did my bedroom today and I was so upset and overwhelmed by everything it almost made me want to give up on everything.

Additionally, I am regularly plagued by the fear of having to move out. How on earth would I ever ever get on top of all this stuff? 

I have considered selling but that also seems extremely overwhelming.

Buy nothing: block after first flake? ,"My rate of getting flaked on whenever I try to give stuff away on Buy Nothing is like 60%. Soo frustrating. Yesterday I had a no show and blocked them. Today I asked someone if they could pick it up today, then they waited until nighttime to actually see how far it was then said they couldn't come today and asked if they could come tomorrow instead. I said ok but when do you think you'll be able to pick it up - it's been hours since they saw that, no response. So I just blocked them too, I would rather just toss this stuff than waste more of my time. I picked them on the condition they could pick up today in the first place. (And I stated what I'm close to but they needed to give me the address since they couldn't be bothered to just look it up. They said they didn't go to that landmark so they didn't know where it was - so lazy.)

I feel like I have to be more ruthless. Too many damn flakes! One flake and you're blocked.. or is that too mean?

Coming from this is similar experiences with many incredibly rude people on Facebook marketplace. I have a pretty low opinion of the general Facebook public at this point after hundreds of bad experiences. 

On both buy nothing and marketplace, almost no one bothers to actually read the description, like c'mon. 

Or I'll say a landmark I'm close to in my neighborhood, and they'll ask me for the address instead of simply googling it! Like wtf! Does everything need to be spoonfed??",declutter,1736915108.0

Has anyone read Put That Stuff Down (the Do Well Method)?,"I got an ad for the book on Instagram today that felt extremely targeted because I am constantly teetering around the definition of a hoarder.

Repository for all of the fams' stuff,"Couple of edits: the family heirlooms are 90% paper records, military history, tons of photographs to scan that is a work in progress. There's really nothing to display per se.

Also, FIL was actually StepFIL and hubs hated him. He was a miserable human being so there's no love or sentiment in his stuff.

I am an only child and my hubs is the oldest, which seems to mean that we are the repository for all of the STUFF from BOTH SIDES of the family. 

Both of us are really into genealogy so we have all of that. Fine, we both agreed to that and neither of us wanted actual family heirlooms falling into the hands of the dingalings in the families. But it takes up (2) 8' x 6' shelving units in our basement. 

My mom is about 1/2 way to hoarder and 3/4 to narcissist so for years she cleaned her house into mine. I finally put my foot down about a decade ago so I at least stopped the flow. Recently I've been working thru how I inherited her need to attach sentimental value to material things and was able to purge a garage space full of furniture and clothing off to charity.

My FIL and MIL passed away 3 years and 1 year ago, respectively. FIL was a hoarder. We have at least 8 of the largest size industrial storage totes full of their crap that does NOT include the above mentioned genealogy items. 

My husband was a very successful bicycle racer when he was in college and has the 2 bikes he used. I should add college for both of us was almost 30 years ago. He claims they were very expensive (I do not doubt this) and that he can now sell them (this is preposterous but pointing that out leads to an argument). 

Regardless, he's made zero effort towards that or sorting thru the contents of the massive totes. Just now, I gently mentioned that I needed for him to schedule a date with the basement to do his part. As usual, that was met with grumbling and excuses. 

This has all been emotionally exhausting for me. I am so proud of the work I've done to break the cycle of keeping *things* but I feel unappreciated and a littled duped that I did my part and I'm still going to be banging my shins on the godforsaken pedals of the 2 relic race bikes indefinitely.

Little Act of Decluttering: 2,"Today I went through the 2 massive (120cm x 75cm or 47x30 inches!) boxes of gift wrap, bags, greetings cards, ribbons etc and condensed down to one! 

I threw out (recycled where possible) battered bags and paper scraps and compiled a big bag to give away to a crafty neighbour.

I accepted a few things to help this:
1) I am not crafty, so pretty string and ribbons for tying packages is pointless
2) Stepkids are grown up so ‚Äúemergency party cards‚Äù are not needed
3) I usually buy gift bags specific to gifts at the time, so the stash I had was easily halved. I clearly never give wine at Christmas as I had 12 festive bottle gift bags‚Ä¶!

Just by getting up and getting started throwing away easy stuff it surprised me how simple it was to switch to active decluttering. Throwing away trash didn‚Äôt feel like I was making a sacrifice for stuff that I might potentially maybe need later (pro tip I decided it wasn‚Äôt worth it to keep a lot of those things). I have thrown out 6 trash bags of trash and 5 bags of donations in 2 days just by getting started by picking up trash.

How to declutter around a hoarder?,"I'm so frustrated right now. I started decluttering my book closet, and found clingfilm wrapped copies Friend of Farthing Wood magazines. They were clingfilm wrapped after an attempt more than 5 years ago to sell them on eBay when we realised they were too heavy to post, so back in the cupboard they went. I read KC Davis' book on tidying recently and told myself ""if I'm not going to sell or donate these, it's okay to throw them in the trash"". So I carried them out to my car on a run to the local tip to throw out with some large items. Except my mum saw it in the car and asked what it was. I told her it was the Farthing Wood magazines, and she looked all sad and misty-eyed and asked ""But why?""

That set me on a spiral because I just got mad at her for asking, because it didn't *need* explaining, and yet I tried to justify it, pointing out I got them about 30 years ago, how we're doing nothing with them. They aren't worth anything (I checked and a set about the same size as mine is listed for like ¬£35). She said ""Well it's up to you, you do what you need to"" but I could tell from her tone she didn't mean it, and she was upset that I was considering it. So I'm back from the tip, the damn magazines are still in my car, and now I'm feeling guilt for even considering doing it, but also resent the idea of putting them back in my room. 

I share the house with her but anything from my childhood is pretty much a no-go area. The loft is full of vacuum packed bags of my artwork and writing from the ages of 5-11, as well as old teddy bears. I think it comes from her still being regretful and upset about my grandparents apparently throwing away all her old toys and things from her childhood, because she's upset that she doesn't have anything, and of a family member who threw out old family photos because they weren't of his direct relations. Anything I try and point out I don't want cluttering my area she tells me to put in her closet, which doesn't solve the problem, just moves it until she passes away and I have to throw it away anyway. I'm trying to improve our living situation because it's so stressful and overwhelming having so much stuff, but the cupboards are just full of things she says she needs or that we'll use, so there's no room to put anything new that she buys.",declutter,1737136710.0
My husband and I write cards that are too heartfelt to throw away. Help decluttering some?,"My husband and I have always written each other long, heartfelt messages in cards. Valentines Day, Christmas, birthdays, etc. Now we have two kids, and all the holidays that come along with that also result in heartfelt cards from him and ‚Äúfrom‚Äù the kids.

The advice for decluttering cards is always to keep the heartfelt ones or the ones with meaningful messages.‚Ä¶but they all have meaningful messages!!! It‚Äôs extremely difficult to just throw away what amounts to handwritten love letters from my family.

Decluttering is now saving me money.,"I needed to get rid of a lot of stuff I owned. I had until the middle of 2025 to accomplish this so I started off taking my time with it (begun September 2024), getting rid of a few things here and there, nothing extreme. Something happened where I technically have the same deadline but decluttering became my main focus, I didn't want to pace myself, I just needed space and to know I had exactly what I needed, a couple of things I genuinely want and love, nothing more and nothing less 

(Not to say being ruthless is healthy, if there's no rush then I think pacing yourself through the process is probably best).

Anyway, I am just about done with decluttering, and I can't explain how much better I feel mentally, I'm no longer overwhelmed with stuff. I treat each item I kept with more care (not sure why) and majority of my items have been given a new life elsewhere (sold and donated to charity). 

Now something I didn't think much about is through decluttering and feeling a massive relief and knowing what I have kept serves a purpose, I no longer wish to bring anything in without thinking about why I want it, what use it would be, the space it would take and most importantly if I'm going to actually use it enough to justify adding it to my things. For example a notepad/notebook, I have gotten into math teasers, I have a pile of printer paper and a small lined notebook with a good amount of fresh paper inside which I have been using to show my working for those math teasers. I got the urge to buy a squared notepad to use instead of all the paper I have... (I put the paper through the shredder when I'm done with it)... Long story short it was likely just a boredom want and I didn't end up buying it. Something so simple and cheap, doesn't take up much room either but if you do this with each item then it soon adds up.

Ofc I'm only human so I'm sure I'll cave and buy something spontaneously and likely regret it but I'm impressed with this intentional buying mindset which I wasn't expecting just by decluttering.",declutter,1737191373.0
Help decluttering with sentimental family,"Anyone have any suggestions for motivating massive decluttering action while living with a very sentimental spouse and kids?
We're on a bit of a unique situation - family of four, kids now teens/young adults, who lived abroad for about 5 years as expats starting when the kids were preteens. While we did a but of purging before we moved our stuff into storage when we moved abroad, it was a pretty chaotic period, so a lot of old kid toys, books, clothes + my spouse's ''I'll organise it one day' stash just went into storage.
Now we're back in our home country, it feels like we're drowning in all the various stuff we collected in our travels plus what the lids/spouse see  as a treasure trove of memories from childhood. (Plus my in-laws just passed over the past year so we're trying to squeeze in childhood memories from my spouse)
I'm the only one in the family that feels stress from having so much stuff. My spouse and the kids seem to relish being surrounded by 'stuff' and tie a lot of memories to physical objects. Opening a box of old plastic toys has the three of them reminiscing about how they got that happy meal toy on a visit with gramma, or how they played with that little plastic figure with a friend when they were  5... every box opened is a multi day process, where every little item is categorised and days are spent making sure all donations (we can't throw anything out) are in good repair (Adding to the 'to be repaired' pile or the 'when we find the missing piece'  piles.) 
I've reacted by being overly aggressive with my own relatively meagre 'stuff' -eg.  I got rid of about 80-90% of my books just to have the calm of some empty shelf space and now spouse's stuff has taken over the empty space.

Change of perspective that helped me be more ruthless with decluttering,"I have been on a decluttering journey for four or five years. Decluttered every room of the house plus the garage. Up to now I must have decluttered hundreds of items. However, I still wasn‚Äôt happy with how some of the rooms looked.

So this is what I did this week. I imagined my best friend who hasn‚Äôt been at my place for several months comes over. What would her first impression be? Would she see any clutter? I started with the bedroom/office, because I spend the most time there.

The change of perspective worked really well. I noticed clutter that I wouldn‚Äôt even have identified as clutter before. Ashamed to say, but in this room alone I counted 18 cluttered spots. A few examples. On one wall there were outdated notes and to do lists. Went straight into the trash. A Disney comic book collection that I owned for years but never had time to read and wasn‚Äôt particularly interested in anymore. Why is that even here? Listed on Ebay and sold the next day. A large piece of wood attached to the desk that a router and cables were fixed to two decades ago. No longer needed. Went straight into the trash. A broken laptop and printer. Took them to the recycling center. Some reusable shopping bags hanging on the side of the desk. Took them to the basement where shopping bags are stored. Several rolls of wrapping paper in a corner. Why do I have to look at them every day when I use wrapping paper maybe 10 times a year? Took them to the basement.

Really happy with the result. Bedroom/office looks great. Probably the best it has ever been.

The only downside is that when I thought my decluttering journey is almost finished, I realized I will have to go through every room again with the friend perspective in mind. So more work ahead.

Paper clutter is my nemesis and I know it's an inherited trait. ,"I have always found paper clutter to be my worst nemesis. I'm miles ahead of where I used to be, but there's always a two inch stack of paper that needs to be sorted/filed/shredded in my office. I try to go through it a minimum of twice a month. 

My parents house had always been ""full"" but never cluttered. It seemed like everything fit. We learned how cluttered it was after my dad passed and cleared out a number of things my mom didn't want to keep. 

But paper remained. My mom's filing system was to pay a bill, put it back in the envelope,  write the check date and payment date on the envelope.  At the end of the month, the stack was rubber banded together and tossed into a tub. Rinse and repeat. 

Then it finally happened.  She couldn't find something she needed. Thankfully she found it quickly, but it was stressful for a minute. 

We have spent the last several Saturdays going through the tubs, shredding what she doesn't need to keep. Taking things out of the envelopes and getting it all sorted into file folders.  The 8 years of paperwork she needed to keep fit in one bankers box. 

She couldn't be more excited knowing how easy it will be to keep track of everything going forward, but man... does it tell you your genes run deep, knowing it took me into my early 30s to get a handle on paper clutter and she is in her early 80s to get it sorted. ",declutter,1737234748.0
Struggling to get rid of sentimental items:-(.,"Hello all! I have recently been browsing this community  &  decided I would give asking for advice a go.

I am 19 years old and I have been on a slow,  but steady declutter journey for the past 5 years. I have gotten rid of so many things! Yet there‚Äôs one category of item that no matter how hard I try to tackle, I have a wave of anxiety and sadness at the thought of letting them go: sentimental items! 

A lot of these items are miscellaneous, and I have a hard time finding proper places for them, some are paper, but a very large majority of them are toys from my childhood. I have decluttered 85% of the toys from my childhood, and left ones that hold a lot of meaning to me, however, as time goes on and I look at them in my closet, I feel like Im stuck. It‚Äôs weird, I cant really explain it well, Ive talked to my therapist about it and we both agree this anxiety / uneasy feeling of getting rid of them stems from childhood trauma stuff with my PTSD.   
One tactic I‚Äôve done is put things Im not ready to get rid of quite yet into a box under my bed, it has limited room, and whatever doesn‚Äôt fit gets tossed or I make room by getting rid of something from the box. Even at this, I feel stuck with these items, Ive tried the picture taking method, but it just made me sad to look back on them. With my toys, Im really struggling, I have very limited space in my room because of how small it is, and me entering adulthood, I feel really embarrassed still holding onto them. 

  
I think another set back- and probably why I am the way I am, is my parents are both VERY sentimental people, and when I first started decluttering, I got yelled at for throwing things away they haven‚Äôt thought of or saw in years, yet when they did, suddenly they needed to keep it. They aren‚Äôt hoarders at all, its just sentimental items that they have difficulty with (I eventually got them to let me throw things away after explaining why I need to do it for my mental health sake, and now my mom is very supportive!!) letting go of.

  
I have tried to watch youtube videos to help with sentimental clutter, but they did not relate to me or made me feel any better about getting rid of my toys. I‚Äôll always keep a few, but I have so many still that I just feel very stuck and embarrassed. I know people say it‚Äôs because ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not ready / it will come in time‚Äù my issue is, I FEEL ready, but I don‚Äôt know how to take the final step. I decluttered old Batman toys I had as a kid, and I have felt a bit better, but some days I miss them, majority of the time I don‚Äôt‚Äîis that contradictor? Yeah, probably, but I don‚Äôt quite know how to word what Im feeling. 

  
Does anyone with mental health issues also struggle with sentimental clutter? What helped you get rid of them without feeling guilty or upset? I have turned to this as a last resort because I feel very alone in this issue, and I am very embarrassed about it. Like I said, Ive watched videos, but none of them really hit home for me enough to motivate me to get rid of my sentimental clutter. If anyone has any advice or suggestion, hell, even just explaining your journey, please let me know. I genuinely feel so stuck with the sentimental clutter, and while Im working on it in therapy, I feel like I need more advice from others who experience these struggles.

  
Thank you, whoever reads this, and I hope each of you here reach your decluttering goals!! Reading through this form gave me new ideas and hope that I can get rid of more things in the future.",declutter,1737238163.0

"""Where can I donate books?"" Psychiatric hospitals!!!!","I've seen a lot of ""what do I do with books"" posts lately, and wanted to share an unexpected answer - your local psych wards. 

Being on the ward was BORING. My longest stay was 3 weeks, and by the end of it I was honestly a little stir crazy. 90% of the time, outside of any groups or whatever, everyone is sitting around in the dayroom. At the adult ward I went to, the entire 5 shelf bookcase was full of stuff published probably no later than 1990. I was born in 1999. I basically begged my mom to bring me a stack of my own to read. 

If you have fiction that you aren't sure what to do with, consider calling up your local psych hospitals and see if they want newer books for their patients. They'll likely be more receptive to paperbacks than hardback (a softer book is a safer book), and they won't be allowed to have certain themes, but I promise you the adults and teenagers that are hospitalized are bored as hell the majority of that stay. 

Take your pre-2000 books to Friends of the Library or Goodwill. Take newer stuff to places like shelters, wards, etc.",declutter,1737266910.0

Way too many clothes but I actually like everything ,"Hi all. I did a fairly decent purge last year of all the stuff that was old, dingy, didn't fit right, or didn't really fit my life style, but I still have way too many clothes. It's to the point that it affects my ability/motivation to keep up on laundry because I don't have room to put everything away. The problem I'm running into now is that I actually like everything I have, so when I try to get rid of stuff I don't know what to get rid of. Sure there's stuff I reach for more often, so those items are a no brainer to keep, but how do you part with the other stuff when I like it and it fits well? Also, I've found that when I get really cut throat about getting rid of stuff, inevitably I end up regretting a a handful of pieces and wishing I still had them later on, which I'm finding is making it more difficult to get rid of stuff now.",declutter,1737326160.0

Making headway and starting to embrace this process....,"I had to move due to health issues. I am unpacking my belongings from a move in 2023.  I have really started to gain momentum and earn the progress of decluttering.  This feels good.  I am looking at it as a maturing process. I want to get rid of the mental clutter in my mind. Peace, calmness, and relief is what I am focusing on and striving for....  Unfortunately, it has been a process to get to this point. I was not prepared emotionally for the vast range of emotions to feel.  I backed off a bit to process my wide range of emotions and start again.

Now, I know why on ""Hoarders"" they don't want to release the excessive amount of belongings.  Starting this process is incredibly hard yet doable.  I am encouraging the lurkers to get at it. Lol.  Anyone can do this. Sure, certain parts of it absolutely do suck.  It is nothing we can't overcome. I am feeling more positive about it, since I worked through a lot of my overwhelm and anxiety about releasing 90% of it.

I think my intentions are also to be kinder to mother earth without overconsumption anymore.  I use to have a horrid shopping addiction to fill some sort of void inside myself. I realize I don't need that anymore to feel whole.

I watched a video about our US trash dumps.  It was disgusting to see how we all contribute to it.

I am disturbed about the amount of brainwashing to buy the commercials are responsible for...every holiday is about decorating.  They already have items out for Valentine's Day and St. Patty's Day, just non-stop consumerism in a capitalistic society.

It is very strange, when I was in my shopping compulsion, I was too into the shopping cycle, or close to it to see the reality of it all.  Wow. What a wake-up call!

The biggest change I have made is not buying something every day,  Now that seems so unnecessary. 

I was very upset when I had two shoe boxes of medicine that had all expired. This is a friendly reminder to check your medicine.

Win!  Kids are more open to decluttering after a shopping trip to the thrift store,"After many trips to drop off donations at various local thrift stores, my kids (6 and 8) asked to see what they're like inside.  I historically haven't brought them to the thrift store because they just looooove getting \*stuff\* just for the sake of it, so I figured it would be a disaster.  But I decided to give it a try, and set expectations ahead of time on what we would bring home.  

Not surprising, they both found something they wanted (I did get them one thing each).  More surprising is when we got home and I was helping them clean their rooms, they were both MUCH more open to getting rid of toys and books they hadn't used in a while.  Normally it's ""but I love that"" or ""I use that all the time"" even if it's something they probably didn't even remember they owned, but after this trip I heard a lot more ""yeah, I can let another kid enjoy that"" or ""I think I'm done with that.""  

I've always told them when decluttering that another kid would be really happy with the toy they no longer care about, so I guess my kids getting a turn at being that theoretical kid must have made it more real to them?  ",declutter,1737381723.0

From what I've read, quilts are more sturdy due to the batting and stitching, but I don't really plan on using it on my bed or for hanging to display. I'd rather have something like a really large throw to snuggle up in on the couch. Would a quilt or blanket be better for that?

"I haven't cleaned my apartment in over a year. I hoard clothes (mainly), papers, stuffed animals/blankets, makeup, art supplies, and memories (photos). Convince me to throw stuff away in TWO SENTENCES.","You have to sentences to convince me to DESTROY IT ALL while I have some amount of energy. 

((Thanks for the messages.))

((I did say I hate existing, but my psychologist and doctors that I mentioned are well aware that I hate existing.. so don't worry about it.))

If you need some miserable context:

Chronic pain and fatigue are killing me. Doctor's don't help much and I'm so sad I've just been laying in bed all day crying and taking sleeping pills to pretend I don't exist. I got through some stuff at some point.. but sometimes it just gets worse all over again. I hate that I have to eat every day. I hate that I have to exist. I am overwhelmed even when I do nothing. Like many of you, cleaning other places is fine. And even thinking about cleaning my own stuff feels like hell. I also live in a small studio apartment and don't have much room. But I'm trying not to just shove stuff on shelves and in closets and in buckets and piles and drawers in the space I do have. But sometimes I don't know how else to organize small things.

I grew up in a hoarder house, but I also grew up with a narcissistic abuser who would steal my things for herself, throw away anything important to me on purpose, throw away my clothes and makeup so that I have to ""look ugly in front of everyone"" when she was mad at me, ""lose"" all of my belongings (only mine) when we moved, *tell me to put all of my favorite and most important and loved possessions/papers/trinkets/memories in a small box because she was throwing away everything else.. and then throw away that special box right before the trash came*.. essentially I had everything I loved or cared about ripped away from me and also things that made me feel comfortable or good about myself. And now I am scared to lose those things. She also never had as live in a functional household with schedules or regular activities like dishes and laundry and stuff. We snuck around to clean our stuff when she wasn't around, ran to do chores when she yelled at us to, and hid in our rooms from her otherwise. When guests visited she would have us clean our disgusting house for days before they came so we could pretend to be clean.

And it does not help that I have ADHD (bad) and maybe autism according to my psychologist but whatever. I feel like the pills are just messing with me, but also like I hardly function without them and never really did. I don't know. But my executive skills or whatever it's called (organization and timing and chores and stuff) are so bad and I basically can hardly function as a human being.

Then there's the chronic illness, which I won't get into, but I have a genetic condition and then small fiber neuropathy for some reason. And all of it feels so bad that it makes me think some real bad thoughts. 

And since I look relatively normal and dress relatively normal and wear a little makeup and don't smell like a sewer rat, people just think I'm okay. Even if I tell them everything. They just say it's fine. Or ""I'm sure it's not that bad"".

I am sad and stressed and embarrassed and anxious. Scared I can't have a life or my own family or a relationship at all. Scared of my landlord coming in. Scared that I can't be a functional person and it's too late for me.. I can't have people over. Not even my family. My dad glanced in my apartment and then told my brother he thought I was a hoarder and my brother called me all concerned..

I've been telling them I think I have a hoarding problem for years.. I'm glad they finally were able to come to that conclusion though. But me.. who lives here every day.. and exists in my mind.. and see's this place.. can't figure out those clues. Not a good source..

I could keep going. I'm sure some of you get it... right??

So, if you read all that.. 2 sentences. Tell me to destroy this stuff. I can't get rid of everything but tell me to get rid of.. something?! Or what to do or.. maybe I just need a friend. I don't know.

If you need more than 2 sentences, have at it.",declutter,1737413056.0

basement full of dead peoples stuff with no organization. how do i tackle without becoming overwhelmed?,"First, the house came pre- cluttered. Our landlords father in law lived here, his children took what they wanted, and left the rest of his mess here.
Second, the man of the house works construction. He has a million tools, odds and ends, lots of things he may possibly one day need (but he could never find it if he did)

"Trust me, you are worth it","I don't know who of you need to hear this, but here we go: you are worth having nice stuff. You don't need to finish using a product that you don't like. You don't have to wear an ugly sweater till it falls apart. Stop telling yourself ""but I paid money"" or ""It's still good enough"". Yes you paid money, but so what?

Let me tell you about my latest success. I have bad teeth genetically, so I should take extra care of them. For whatever reason we have a ton of mouthwash and I'm the only one using it. The products we have hurt my mouth and I do not like the taste at all. So I had the result of barely using it (not good for my teeth) and if, it felt like torture (not good for my mental health). I finally had enough. I went to the store, got me a bottle of kids friendly mouthwash (it colors teeth pink that aren't brushed correctly and tastes like yummy 1990s bubblegum :D). Back home I took all bottles of mouthwash and poured them out, except for my new one of course. 


With that little action I now created more space. Got rid of stuff that no one uses anyways. And I now have a mouthwash that I'm looking forward to using every day, which is also good for my teeth. My inner self still screams about the ""wasted money"" sometimes, but was it a waste to throw away stuff I don't really use? No. And it helps so much to just tell myself ""I am worth it to have things I enjoy"".

My pantry is a little too well stocked - for the next 2 weeks I'm only buying perishables,"I try to keep a certain number of different types of ingredients, like 2 kinds of pasta and 5 kinds of frozen meat. I rarely buy exactly the same ingredient twice in a row. That gives me enough food to cook creatively but not so much that it's unmanageable.

For the next 2 weeks I'm only letting myself buy perishable foods like veggies and dairy. Everything else comes from storage. After that I'll re-assess and maybe change a few habits.

Food I've already made to use up staples:

* A ""clear out the fridge"" salad with frozen parsley and long-lasting veggies like carrot, cabbage and radish.

* Protein bars with nuts, peanut butter, chocolate chips, cinnamon and maple syrup.

* Pickled mustard seeds because I have like a pound of whole mustard seeds. 

Food I plan to cook next:

* Instead of buying yet another spice mix from Trader Joe's, I took pictures and will try to make a few copycat mixes. I have a lot of whole spices.

* Grain bowls, tacos, pasta salads, barley soups, anything with meat and a lot of grains. I have like 6 bags of grains to chip away at.

* Some of the 5 chubs of chorizo to put in said grain bowls and tacos.

Family doesn‚Äôt allow me to get rid of all their junk,"I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I live with my mom, and my uncle moved in with us a few years ago.

He doesn‚Äôt clean up after himself, the few times he‚Äôs done the dishes they‚Äôre still dirty and I have to rewash them, he‚Äôll let used tissue paper pile up in his bedroom till you can‚Äôt see the floor, etc. 

My mom has more of the hoarder mentality, but the house doesn‚Äôt look like a full on hoarder home. It just looks cluttered and embarrassing.

"Chances are, everything is fine","Hello, r/declutter!

I don't frequent this sub very often, so I apologize if this post has issues in some way. I just wanted to share something, as I have a history of hoarding and am working on that all the time :) 

A few years ago, while I was living on my own, my parents gifted me their old TV. They had also bought a new label maker, and peppered the TV and remote in little hearts and a message for me. It was great, I loved it. Over time, I started to want a newer, bigger TV, but I felt guilt about wanting to get rid of a cute gift from my parents. ""How would they feel if I got rid of it?"" I would ask myself. 

I end up having to move back in with them, and we put the TV in storage. I'm moving back out soon, and we're going through it and my mom goes, ""Who's is this?"" It's my TV. ""Who gave it to you?"" You did!? ""Oh, I totally forgot. Neat. Do you want to keep it?"" I'm getting rid of it and buying the bigger TV for my new place. 

So the point of my story is to let other people who struggle to let go of things because of sentimentality, that the person who gave you the item probably gave it you, for you to do whatever you want with it. If its time has come and it has to go, that's okay!! Nobody is mad at you and you're doing great. :] ",declutter,1737500672.0
Finally got to hard areas as working mok w 2 little kids.  Seeking a little high five.,"Edit: Mom. 

Big organizing day: fam w 2 little kids. May I share since you get it?

Cross posted. 

I finally got to some tough areas of the house for me today.  

The 2 motivations:
1) seeing a mom friends house that was so relaxing and curated and decluttered. 

2) I had one goal: maximize a pile of  donations from around the house. Worked better than ""I want to do my bath and closet"".

My husband is not the type to appreciate tidying. So I'm here.

26 hours over the last 2-3 days (lesson learnt, smaller bites better for my Gen X back. Ouch.)

----
The big wins:

2 little ones 3 and 7 home that last 3 hours. They agreed to let a box of toys go into the garage to fit their new Xmas presents. 

And after a tour -instead of their usual tears -they agreed to how I organized ! (They got ice cream and art time w me for not complaining.)

The master closet has been my Achilles heel. It's the only place big enough to stash clothes, subdries, bags we didn't get organized before  some visitors (smoke affected extended family from LA fires).

1 garage done. I did half before Xmas and today finally got holiday decor down, boxed and up high.

3 dressers done 

-----
Finally did:
-13 Master bath drawers
-clothes donated, hung or folded
-1 dresser finished
-11 bins of sundries sorted (lotions, hair, tooth care, makeup etc)

Lesson:  wish I pushed harder or paid  to organize after we moved in 2 years ago. We got used to suboptimal locations.

-----

Whole house led to:

10 grocery bags to donate

-a full outdoor trash bin and 1/2 full recycling 

-3 dressers done, 10 toy bins, 12 built in drawers organized. 8 plastic bins of subdries done. 

-and Christmas decor inside finally down and boxed. My kids wanted to keep the tree up!


------

Kids:

Did their 8 kallax bins of toys/books/crafts organized by category. Goal: good enough. Fewer categories. I have 4 left. 

Lesson: KonMari is too much but I kept what worked (smaller bins in bins, donate serviceable things I don't like/don't spark joy.)

-their desk, bookshelf and nightstand drawers organized. 

-finished 1/2 their closet sorting toys, clothes and more seeking donations

----------

What helped:

I usually have a mountain of laundry organizing day. This time I did the many loads beforehand. Then I folded it all. So today it just had to be sorted by person and finally put into dresser drawers organized hung. 

2.5 hours of 2 cleaning people today after a month. And then one stayed 2 more hours to help w my closet. I can't declutter if the house is dirty. 

-accountability:  I just couldn't get to this closet for a whole year without someone present/cleaning near. I keep getting stuck when a bin/bag had mixed categories.

When in the kids' room over last few weeks I did small bits like separating few clothes we wear less. Then finally I was ruthless today. 

-simplify: 

I always before today go too slow. I have  ideas of specific people with younger kids to give things.  I previously thought  ""sell, give my friend, donate to goodwill, list for buy nothing, keep in garage, closet or dresser."" That's ridiculous. Just did donate/keep/toss.

Thanks for reading. I try to organize an area here or there quarterly, but it's the first time I got so many areas to a place of satisfaction.

Advice, tips, thumbs up welcomed.

Should I throw away my grandmother's china in order to get a new set of enamel tableware?,"I have an opportunity to buy a nice set of enamel tableware second hand.

The price is great, we have a new baby and are planning more children and I'm tempted because it doesn't collect weird smells and flavour like plastic/silicone, it's really compact and lightweight. And aesthetic. It's a nice full set with a lot of plates and we host a lot. 


However, my current set is china from my grandma. It's gorgeous but clunky and the main issue is I dont keep a kosher kitchen, but all my family do, so I can't give them to anyone else. I know that no one else is interested in sentimental old china. Also I still feel sentimental about it, and I love using it daily for that reason.

Need help deciding what to do with my CD collection,"**TL;DR: never thought of parting with my CD collection; idea of doing so was triggered when I realized I dislike the look of my CD rack in my new home. Unsure if I should get rid of the whole collection, part of it, just the rack, or none of the above.**


I have a pretty large CD collection. I'm a bit nostalgic about the medium itself tbh. I know it's much easier to listen to digital music nowadays, but I still have my old stereo with CD player, which I do use occasionally (not as often as I used to back in the day, obviously). 
Most of them, I admit, are from an era in my life I've moved on from - obscure subgenres, rare finds I was proud of 20 years ago, ""genre classics"" I just *need* to have in my collection - and I've been keeping them because they're part of my collection, not because I really listen to them now. (I was a total music nerd back then.) There are some treasured favourites, but most aren't. 

I recently moved and still have all the CDs in boxes. In my old apartment I had them in a large wall mounted CD rack which held almost all of them, and a few extras were on a small floating shelf (mostly because they have special packaging too thick for the rack).
Today when an acquaintance was over to help mount some shelves, I expressed that I'm not sure where to mount my CD rack as I can't figure out a space on my wall that would look good. Said acquaintance then confirmed that the rack isn't very stylish, that it would make the wall look cluttered, and proceeded to suggest I keep them in a drawer (and get rid of the rack.) When I told them there were too many CDs to fit in a drawer, they were baffled about how many I have, and proceeded to give some friendly suggestions which I feel won't really work for me either. 

I didn't come to a conclusion so they're still in boxes for now. And now I'm starting to doubt if I should even keep my collection at all. 

Here's my dilemma: 

- I do want to achieve an uncluttered look and lifestyle. I don't have any collections or sentimental items on display, the CD collection was my only exception. 

- I used to like that they were displayed on a wall instead of occupying space elsewhere (though I admit I hated the dust on them, but at least they're easy to wipe). 

- I'm not sure why I no longer like the look of that particular CD rack; it's in perfect condition and holds a large collection so wouldn't it be stupid to get rid of it? Why create a new task for myself, buying another storage for my CDs? 

- Should I get rid of some? If so, which ones? ""I hardly listen to it"" won't work as a criterion since I hardly listen to *any* of them. Might as well get rid of all and just digitalise. 

- Or maybe keep only a few favourites and, actually, put them in a drawer. But where would I draw the line? 

- And will I miss some of them for their decorative aspect (cool cover)? Will I miss the music itself? Will I miss owning ""rarities""? 

I have no idea how to tackle this and am so confused about what I want. I'm really bad at decision making in general (I have ADHD), and at decluttering specifically. Any thoughts about this will be appreciated!! 

Sorry about the wall of text (and I realize it's a total first world problem, lol). Thanks for reading!

Beginning My Declutter Journey-Thoughts on Hiring a Professional Company?,"I have decided to begin my declutter journey! Its excited but overwhelming. I plan on taking it slowly. I wanted to get some advice on maybe hiring a professional company? I know its expensive...... but do you think its worth it? the rates I am seeing at a local company are $1,200.00 for 6 hours of help.... 

for me this would be a one time cost and then maybe just take over from there by myself... I cannot afford to do this twice.... 

I am someone who tends to get overwhelmed and give up easily creating a vicious cycle. I also grew up in and out of foster care and facilities so at times its hard for me to give up things because I am scared I will regret parting with it. so overtime, obviously things pile up and I don't ever end up using or needing them....

Anyways if anyone has ever paid for help with decluttering I would love to know your experience?

Decluttering is half the battle,"My goal was to have 3 rounds of decluttering in 2025, and I am currently in the process of doing round 2. 

I have gotten rid of quite a bit of stuff. 

But I realized that declutterring is only half of it. The other stuff is being mindful of what you bring into the home. 


So here are some tips. 

1. Use your local library instead of buying new books. You can also get video games at the library. 

2. Repair. Bite the repair cost.  I had 4 winter coats 3 of which had broken zippers. 
I bit the bullet, and I brought them to a tailor. It cost me $210 to get the zippers replaced. I found 2 people on my local ""buy nothing group"" who needed winter coats and I gave 2 of them away. I now have 2 winter coats one for colder days and one for slightly less cold days. 

I also got my luggage repaired. It needed a zipper. It cost me $65. So I didn't have to buy a new one, or keep my old one hanging around, feeling too guilty to throw it out. 

I know that sounds like a lot of money, and it is, but I probably saved that on not buying new books. I also didn't have to buy new luggage, or a new coat. 

If you have Birkenstocks, you can change the straps. You don't have to get new sandles.

3. Buy for your size:

Do not buy sizes you think you will eventually fit into when you lose weight. All that will happen will be that you will lose weight l, and you will want to buy new clothes. OR you will not lose weight, and you will have clothes hanging around. 

If you are that certain you will lose the weight and not have clothes for a particular season, learn some basic sewing skills and tailor your clothes down. Believe you will feel good. Or take a few pieces to your tailor to do it. 

4. Abstain from compulse purchases:

Do you need that necklace for that outfit? Or do you have one that will do the trick? Do you need a new outfit for that wedding? Or will the outfit you wore it to the last wedding do the trick? 

5. Take care of your things: polish that silver, treat that stain before washing, wash your shower curtain and liners, clean and maintain your items, get rid of the tea stains in your mugs, put antivirus on your computers, sharpen your knives and scissors, tune your piano. This way you can use what you have. 

6. Repurpose: you don't need a seperate item for every use. Do you need a mandolin? Or will a knife do the trick? Does your shower liner need to be thrown away? But another cloth one, and use the polyester cloth one as a liner. It will last way longer. Do you need to buy a cup for your toothbrushes or will an old mug do the trick? Do you need to buy a spray bottle from the dollar store, or will your old fantastic spray bottle do the trick? Do you need a new bathmat because yours is worn out? Or will an old towel do the trick? Do you need seperate dog poop bags? Or will an old bread bag, or fruit, or vegetable bag, do the trick? (It's amazing how many we accumulate.) 

7 give consumable gifts: finishing salts, honey, maple syrup, tea, coffee, chocolate, soaps, alcohol, hot chocolate bombs, scratch and wins, soup mix etc. 

Or gift a service: landscapping, maid, personal chef, professional organizer. 

Or an experience: plays, concerts, symphonies, movie theater outings, out to dinner, dinner theater tickets, gun range, laser tag, escape room, hot air balloon ride etc. 

Or classes: cooking classes, gun safety classes, flying lessons, baking classes, language lessons, instrument lessons, dancing lessons etc

You don't want to be part of someone else's clutter problem. 

8. Do you have someone who brings you random gifts or things because they are considerate and thoughtful? 

Tell them while you appreciate the thought and gesture, that you are trying to declutter. Tell them that the next time they want to bring you some gift that maybe they can call and ask you first to see if you want or need it. Unless it's a gift that the 2 of you can enjoy doing together like maybe some wine and cheese. 

Every bag you bring in, is a bag you will have to bring out sometime, either while moving etc. 

9. Start being ""low waste."" I buy cleaner tablets, laundry detergent in powder bulk, I use solid soap bars,(or liquid soap tablets) powder to  gel to dish soap(and I reuse my dispensers)  solid stain remover bars instead of sprays, shampoo, and conditioner bars, dr Bronner's for body wash etc. Buy replacements heads for your razors, or buy a straight razor etc. 

You will have way less clutter under your sink and in your laundry room. You won't have a bunch of empty plastic containers waiting for recycling. 

10. Use what you have. 

Use what you have, instead of going to buy new stuff.

Decluttering my clothes and smalls,"Today after months of stalling I‚Äôve tackled my clothes again finally, I have already started with some categories last year but today I did a general sort out as I‚Äôve started buying more clothes that suit me colour and fit wise and that I‚Äôm more comfortable in most important of all (compared to my early 20s crop top mania).
I started with my skirts and dresses, been avoiding them for a long time but my thoughts were ‚Äúif it‚Äôs not my size it‚Äôs going away‚Äù and that helped me get a lot out.
Then my tops, I was dreading this, but dry rot saved me from hard choices, and what wasn‚Äôt affected I looked at and thought ‚Äúwould I feel comfortable wearing this now? Is it too short/small?‚Äù And that helped me be more real with myself, I am making more space for clothing I like after all.
Then I went through the even worse sock pile, for some reason I have heaps of small ankle socks that are all used to some degree, so I picked the newer looking ones and I‚Äôm parting with the obviously faded, discolored or pilled ones.
Sure I might become a caterpillar and need those socks but realistically it‚Äôs so overwhelming to have so many to have to sort out, so I‚Äôm keeping what I have space for and the rest is going.
I also have a lot of tights, I will only keep a couple of pairs and get rid of the ones that look too small, I can always re-buy them if needed and at least I can be sure they‚Äôre my size.
I‚Äôve done a pretty good job on it I think, I‚Äôm quite proud of myself for being more realistic about what I‚Äôm comfortable wearing and what is my old fantasy me insisting on keeping for sentimental reasons .

Some clutter has left the building!,"I had a couple of things that were just hanging around because I was either waiting on an answer or hadn't made it out the door with me.  One was a wedding dress (I did a bad thing and picked it up for $20 when it was half off at a thrift store) and the other was a duplicate set of new-in-box DVDs that I hadn't realized I had until I was going through my collection.  

I had hoped the wedding dress would go to a new home with someone I knew, the person didn't want it because it didn't really suit the vibe they were going for.  So. . . I did the thing and returned it.

Celebrating big progress!,"Over the past few months, I‚Äôve been religiously watching reading, writing down tips and tricks, tracking and planning for my big Declutter this year. On one of the posts someone shared the challenge to get rid of 2025 items in the year 2025. I have worked so hard and been absolutely ruthless. I‚Äôm tackling one room at a time and using all the tips and tricks and things that I‚Äôve written down and now have a saved note in my phone to reference. It‚Äôs only January and I have already Decluttered 700 items and it feels so good. I am not super worried about hitting my goal at all. And truthfully, even if I hit it, I will continue till I feel like I have Decluttered every room in the house. 

I don‚Äôt know if this is the case for anyone else but one of the biggest pieces of advice or tips that I would give is to try to only declutter when you‚Äôre in the mood to do so. It‚Äôs so weird because if I sit down in a room and just try to force myself to declutter so I can get things finished Sometimes I get rid of nothing. But when the mood strikes and I‚Äôm feeling good about clearing space the same area I could literally fill an entire trash bag. I really do think it‚Äôs something that you need to be in the right mindset to be able to do the right way.

A rant -- feeling limited due to a new minor injury,"I'm typing with one hand since my other which is injured needs to rest. I've been in a cranky mood today and I hope it's okay to vent it out.

I was so happy for xmas when my friends listened and gave me consumables. However they did not repeat that for my bday, ugh... they gave the usual thoughtful Amazon gifts, most of which I didn't want, with gift receipts. So this meant I had to make time after work to try to return these items.

This was the first time I got a gift receipt for an unopened item that Amazon just automatically marked as one item that could not be returned. I was so annoyed at that since why allow a gift receipt for something that can't be returned and get my hopes up temporarily that at least I could send it back until I pulled it up from the order number? I was able to at least select to return 2 of the other items. Their order numbers were half cut off the gift receipt so I had to guess a bit before they pulled up.

I drove to UPS. since it's closest to my home for drop off. After waiting in a long line, it was finally my turn. They had trouble scanning the QR code and said it just wouldn't register. First time I ever had this issue so I asked them what to do and they said to contact Amazon Customer Service. I went home, looked up how to troubleshoot the problem myself since it's impossible to figure out how to contact Amazon through a gift that I did not order myself, then nervously cancelled my return and then resubmitted the return which required giving my reasons for each item again. This generated a new QR code. Drove back to UPS. The line was longer this time. After waiting, same shitty issue.

This time, from my phone, I cancelled my return, reselected the items, gave my return reasons, then selected Staples. It's a longer drive but at least a short line. Thank God the new QR code worked here. It was extra annoying to keep hauling the items while my one hand was injured, too.

All the f\*ing gas, mileage, and time for this BS return probably isn't worth it though. Last time, Amazon didn't even credit my account with a gift card credit for the gift receipt and it was like pulling teeth to get the link to a customer service rep for the gift return. I saved the gift order number paper on my desk in the meantime just in case, so I can't declutter that now.

Back home, I  still have other responsibilities, which include routine cleaning and I'm struggling with using just one hand to get it all done... but it's been two weeks since my minor injury so I've delayed my routine cleaning long enough and things are starting to get gross. This includes trying to troubleshoot a toilet leak issue that is not caused by the flapper -- I already tried changing the flapper since that's the easiest solution, ugh. I also picked up a window re-screen from my local hardware store and had to put that back on the window and found something out of place while I was there resting on top of the window sill that I don't recall leaving there before that I don't know where exactly should go... it's weird since I don't leave things randomly in my home and I live alone, ugh. Cleaning out my Dyson wasn't easy with one hand either, and I'm annoyed more and more on the limits of bagless vacuums.

I'm not old, but now I'm understanding better why those folks that are older or disabled can feel so restricted in getting basic stuff done and why clutter can more easily accumulate for them. And now I get why some of my older relatives complain so much :p",declutter,1737619287.0

"Clothes declutter, 8 bags done","After yesterday‚Äôs initial declutter I have tackled my jeans/trousers and long sleeve tops/jumpers, 8 bags in total to donate counting my ones from yesterday as well.
It was a bit daunting, and I wasn‚Äôt feeling well as I have a bad cold today, but the more I was trying on the more ruthless I was, the more I was getting annoyed at trying on clothes that badly fit the more I wanted to get rid of them.
Now I can finally put all my clothes in their spaces.
I still need to declutter further, and I will continue tomorrow, I wanted to continue today but I don‚Äôt want to push myself too far considering I‚Äôm not feeling well and this was a good 1 and a half hour at least of trying clothes on.
Seeing all these bags was really a wake up call, all these bags of clothes that didn‚Äôt fit me were occupying space that I needed for clothes that do fit me.. I really need to stay on top of what I have.
I am buying new clothes recently on Vinted and that‚Äôs what pushed me to do a serious declutter, I was wondering what was keeping my clothes from fitting in their designated spaces, Why do I seem to have so many clothes yet only wear the same ones that I keep out of my wardrobe?

700 items in 7 days challenge,"On 31 Dec I posted about how I wanted to finish out 2024 strong by finishing my 2024-item declutter chart. It was a fun challenge to get rid of 400 random items with time pressure, and I even finished. Second old chart with 1000 items left. This included house items,digital photos and emails, and paper recycling (Post here https://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/1hqawqm/400_items_to_go_today/) 

Since the great start to the new year, it's been a busy few weeks (plus a round of the flu) and the clutter has crept back in. Old post on the bookshelf. Dried up playdough hiding in a corner. To-donate sneakers that are lingering in a box instead of going in a donate bag. And sleeping bags and hiking shoes that need stored away.

With 7 days left to go in January, I'm picking up a new challenge: decluttering 700 things before February. If anyone else wants to jump in, welcome!


Update: 

Welp, we all got the flu consecutively and inhad a work deadline so am barely at 100 items (a mix of physical items and virtual photos + emails). That still leaves 600 items to clear out in 4 days. 

Ideas: Backup and then delete more of the ridiculous amount of digital photos on my phone (more than 25G). Do a closet purge for me and the kids. Clean out the craft and games cupboard. 

It's annoying that I've gotten rid of so much over the last years, and yet there's still so much clogging up the house. (Which admittedly, has limited storage.) Do I honestly have too many hoodies (cold climate) or do I just need a better organization system? Do we have too many art supplies, or do they need a better (toddler-proof) box?

Also I make a lot of excuses for how it would be a shame to declutter perfectly good things. Sigh. More progress later.

Update #2: Things are moving along better! Deleted 175+ photos (my poor phone is much happier). Tackled the spice drawer earlier, so now on to the higher kitchen cupboards and laundry room. In the bedrooms pulled out a pile of outgrown clothes and brand-new diapers to donate. I remember finding a bag of new diapers at a thrift store when I was a young mom on a budget... I hope these make someone happy! I also have a box of cloth diapers that I may pull down tomorrow and add to the growing pile of donation bags. Total number as of today: 455. Two days left to get it up to 700.

Update #3: Picking up speed! Got up to 650 so far. That included cleaning out kids' clothes, a craft box, and a folder of old papers from 2021 (why?). I also accepted the hard truth that, as much as I want to tailor thrifted clothes into cool new outfits, it's just not a priority these days. So into the donation bags with an armful of ""this will make someone else happy"" clothes from my sewing collection.

I also sorted out our winter wear box, because we don't actually need 5-7 pairs of gloves and 3+ hats per person. One of the organizations our church supports is in Albania, and so monthly someone drives a truck of donations over there. It snows here maybe twice a year, briefly, and their weather can get significantly colder. I'm hoping some little Albanian boy gets really excited at the dinosaur sweater, striped hat, and snow gloves my kids have grown out of!

Update #4: 700 and more! This included a bag of play dishes that always get scattered around, a bunch of outgrown goodies, and worn out socks (recycled not donated :P) Phone screenshots from 2023, window clings that were beautiful but annoying. The drinking tube attachment, that I never use,  to my running backpack, which I enjoy using. There is no law that says we have to keep all parts of an item üòÖ

I also went through my clothes while on the decluttering high and was able to say goodbye to several pieces I was keeping because I loved the idea of them. Green cargo pants (too-thin fabric), plaid shorts (fashionable but didn't fit well), a messenger hat (trendy but looked like a mushroom when worn). Gloves that were supposed to be screen-touch-sensitive but that were mostly annoying. Colorful sweaters that were warm and pretty, but always got pushed to the back of the closet, because I have others I like more. 

One of my favorite things about these purge challenges is it changes the way I look at my home. Instead of seeing items defensively (""Oh no, I'm sure I'll need it!) the outlook changes to seeing things offensively (""Oh yes, what else can I find that I don't need!"") 

It's also extremely satisfying to see the garbage bags full of donations and recycling build up in the hall. One wild decluttering day at a time.",declutter,1737712535.0

Friday 15: Medicine cabinet!,"Open your medicine cabinet! It's time to remove expired and no-longer-relevant items. Let's talk about what you're going to keep (from common categories -- you may be storing some of these elsewhere):

* **Medications** that are unexpired and appropriate for conditions you experience. [Here is a guide for safe disposal](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/special-features/dont-be-tempted-use-expired-medicines).
* **Skincare and haircare items** that are unexpired and that you actually use and like. 
* **Make-up** that is unexpired and that you actually use. 
* **Gadgets and things** (toothbrush, razor, hair clips, hair brush, nail clippers, etc.) that are clean, in good repair, and actually used.

Whenever expiration dates come up, there will be people who insist they don't matter at all. If you need to take this position, do the research to determine if the items you're keeping are actually safe when expired. Also remember: if it's expired, either you don't like it that much, or you stockpiled too many.

If you find that items for elaborate skincare, haircare, or make-up routines expire unused over and over, it may be time to simplify your expectations for yourself.

Another Small Win - Kitchen,"I'm not systematically decluttering my home as I don't think that's workable for me and my family. But I'm doing a bit when I can.

Today, after I'd cleaned my kitchen, I wanted to put a couple of small electrical items away. But the cupboards were full so I cleared out, cleaned and reorganised five cupboards. Found lots of space once I'd been through them and found stuff that just needed ***TO GO.*** 

Anything not used in the last year - ***OUT***

Anything out of date - ***OUT***

Anything I had no use for - ***OUT***

Husband argued with me about some of it but I said, no, it had to go because having it in the house was depressing and it wasn't just cluttering up the house, it was cluttering my mind and think about what the negativity was doing to me. He stopped arguing. 

Lots more to do but slowly, slowly . . .

I had some furniture that was donated to me picked up and taken to the thrift store today.  I was able to set my desk up in a nice little corner with the new space.

It was a bit of a trust exercise, but I didn't check her bags and she didn't check mine. The result was awesome.

Mental clutter and money,"Okay, here's a bit of an odd one. If this isn‚Äôt the right group, feel free to point me elsewhere, but I do think this ties into decluttering‚Äîspecifically, mental clutter.

I‚Äôve always been pretty good at decluttering physical stuff. In fact, I currently live out of a suitcase, which forces me to think about ""clutter"" in a broader sense. It‚Äôs not just about physical belongings; it‚Äôs about the mental space things take up too.

So, here‚Äôs my question: how do I let go of the *need* to chase small amounts of money or handle petty tasks that aren‚Äôt worth the mental load?

For example, XfinityMobile overcharged me for a service I canceled. I spent time contacting them, got a partial credit, but it‚Äôs not the full amount. Now I‚Äôd have to call again to get the rest. The refund I‚Äôd be chasing is about $25, I earn more than that an hour but well, ""free money."" Logically, I know it‚Äôs not worth my time‚Äîbut it‚Äôs still on my to-do list and occupying my headspace.

What‚Äôs odd is I don‚Äôt sweat losing money in other scenarios. If a meal I ordered doesn‚Äôt taste good, I let it go without a second thought. But when it‚Äôs something like this‚Äîa phone carrier overcharge‚ÄîI can‚Äôt seem to let it go.

I‚Äôve made progress with mental decluttering in other areas (e.g., no longer obsessively cross-checking expenses with receipts thanks to budgeting apps), but this particular habit sticks. It feels like this is more about the principle than the money, and I‚Äôd love advice on how to shift my mindset.

Anyone else deal with this?",declutter,1737892181.0
Decluttering clothes while pregnant,"Help! I‚Äôve made so much progress in my decluttering journey in the last 2-3 years, but the one thing I keep neglecting is my clothing situation. 

I‚Äôve always struggled with my weight. 4 years ago I was in the best shape of my adult life. 3 years ago I got pregnant and in the last year and a half I‚Äôve been heavier than I‚Äôve ever been. I‚Äôm one of those unlucky folks who can‚Äôt lose any weight while nursing. Now I‚Äôm pregnant again, so of course it will be even longer before I fit back into old clothes. 

The trouble is, I have no idea how to assess what old clothes will fit, and therefore no idea what to get rid of or keep. I‚Äôve got clothes ranging from small to x-large.

I don‚Äôt love the idea of saving things ‚Äújust in case‚Äù they fit again, or as motivation to fit into them. I‚Äôm trying to have a healthier relationship with my body than to pressure myself to be back to the jeans and crop tops I confidently wore in my mid 20s. 

However, it‚Äôs unrealistic of me to get rid of anything that doesn‚Äôt fit right now. I‚Äôm 21 weeks pregnant so all that would leave me is my maternity clothes and xl lounge clothes.

Any advice on how to tackle this clothing situation would be greatly appreciated! Do I just have to wait until I pop out this baby and start getting rid of large clothes as I shed the baby weight?

What creative solutions have you come up with that helped you get rid of clutter?,"I had to clear out a whole 3bedroom house in a weekend as it sold. I posted on Facebook pictures of EVERYTHING in there that I would have sold anyways - bedroom sets, dining tables etc etc.  

I asked for someone with a truck and helpers to come and take it for free. Caveats - they had to take it on a certain day and do it without my help. 

I had dozens (maybe hundreds?) of takers. I chose a guy whose response was very specific ‚ÄòI have a truck and 3 family members, we will come on Thursday. Here is my cell‚Äô. (Not just that stupid ‚Äòis this available?‚Äô Message). 

They came and took everything - coming multiple times. They removed everything they wanted as well as everything they didn‚Äôt want. 

It was a family that had just come to Canada and had nothing. They were SO THRILLED I was giving them this stuff (the look on their faces was so worth it!). 

I lived several hours from this house and my alternatives were to rent a dumpster or try to sell everything cheap on Facebook. The dumpster would have cost me money and selling everything would have been slow and painful. This solution was a win win (even though of course I had the voice in my head the whole time telling me I could have sold this stuff for money). 

I think often we have these mental blocks to getting rid of things that seem insurmountable but just need creativity (and maybe a 48hour deadline!!!).

I also pulled out these things to be kept separate

Cards (different than letters since I expect to decimate this box really deeply)

Photos to be processed in a similar way and to be scanned

Really important photos - to be hand scanned and put someplace safe

Kids Art

I then processed each box and placed the contents in the above boxes, filed it in the file cabinet, pulled aside for someone else or threw it away,

I left everything in boxes for a couple weeks as I went through the house a couple times, finding a couple more boxes or folders here and there.

I then went to the store and found plastic boxes that fit my stuff perfectly (each era gets a box 14x14x3) which also helped give me a feeling for how much to keep/throw away.

I still have to process my piles of photos in a similar way to send them off to scanning, but I was able to shrink my sentimental papers down significantly, get them in a semblance of order, and reduce the clutter around my house significantly!

Lots of recycling has gone out the door, plus the old boxes they were in are gone was well making a lot of space in the attic and closets.

It was definitely a bittersweet experience going through everything so be prepared for that but it felt so good to get done and get it all in order. I could imagine doing a second cycle through at some point to further reduce stuff but feel even if I don't I'm not leaving a pile of crap to my kids.",declutter,1737992606.0

I need help and do the know where to turn,"59 years old and I'm at my wit's end. I live in the basement of my home, where I have my own room. It started out uncluttered, but over the last 5-ish years it's gotten to the point that I'm so overwhelmed, so I will get some work done in there, but then I'm exhausted and dont  do anymore for weeks, months. I have adhd and depressed. I will keep trying to get my bedroom organized but it seems like it's never going to be done, then the depression gets worse. I wasn't like this in my 20s and 30s, but that's another story for another day. I need someone to come do the work for me. I have done a good chunk of my own but my mental health and energy just conk out really fast. I don't have a lot of money to shell out for a pricy organizer. My messy room just leaves me feel sad all the time, but it's also my only refuge. I've looked online for help but that in itself is overwhelming too. My family is a source of stress so they won't help me, and the few friends I have locally wouldn't help or understand.

"I finally donated all the stuff in my ""But I can sell this for good money"" pile!","One of the things I've been hung up on is holding onto things I know I don't want or need anymore, but that I hung onto because I thought I'd get around to selling them on Poshmark, eBay, locally on FB marketplace, or wherever. It's mostly brand-name clothes (not super high-end designer, but brands that have a good reputation for quality and get decent prices on re-sale markets) or ones still with the tags on, and a few tools that were project-specific, like a post-hold digger. 

But you know what? They've been sitting around for over a year (or two, in the case of the post-hold digger), and if I haven't sold them by now, I'm not going to. So - they're all donated! Gone from house. I didn't even play the ""I'll give myself until X date, and if it's still here, then I'll donate"" mental game with myself. I've had plenty of time to sell them, and I didn't, and I don't know why today was the day, but I was just DONE with knowing that stuff was still in my house.

Yes, I could've spent some time and gotten a few hundred dollars selling it all, but I guess I put on price on being free from the mental and physical load of it.",declutter,1738017933.0
Thanks for the dumpster advice!,"Someone on here suggested when we got a dumpster to go up a size, even if we thought we didn't need it!  THanks for that advice.  We are hoping to finally move in about a month, but its later than we planned, so we decided to go ahead and get the dumpster in while we are waiting to move and start decluttering. Hubby is on vacation, so it seemed like the perfect time.  

He filled it about 15% full today!  Attic is empty.  Pool furniture that was no good gone!  Got rid of a lot of old mattresses, and tomorrow he starts on the garage.  I am so excited to see things going that we have had for a while, because it doesn't fit in our weekly can and we didn't have a way to the dump.

I started packing the kitchen and it was nice not to have to figure out how to get rid of stuff that we no longer needed and wasn't really good enough to donate.

Once we are done this time next week with the dumpster, our premove declutter will be done!  We will be taking a few things to use until they can be replaced with something nicer, but I'd say all in all, over the last 5 years, we have gotten rid of about 35-40 percent of our stuff and downsizing to a 20% smaller house. 

Of course, you are never finished decluttering as long as you buy new stuff, but I do feel like we are as close to being done as a person can get.

And if you are in doubt, and have the money, get the dumpster. It's amazing how easy it is to let go of stuff when you only have a week to fill it up! And go up a size from what you think you'll need because its amazing the stuff that you find once you start tossing big items.

It feels so good to have it GONE,"We have sold and donated SO MUCH STUFF over the past two years.

"New to this sub, new-ish to decluttering, learning a lot.","My partner and I have clutter. We're newly 60, so we've both have had many years to accumulate stuff. 

My partner likes stuff. When we blended our stuff just over a decade ago, I promised to not throw out his stuff. This means that I manage my stuff. Although, two years ago I told him that if he brings stuff home, he has two options: 1) remove something in the house to accommodate the new stuff. Or 2) store it in the shop (his domain).

In the past month-ish, I have been going through my stuff. WOW! I filled up the entire area of the back of my Outback. This was clothes and shoes only. I have worn my Blundstone boots exclusively for years unless I'm going hiking or on the river. I still have shoes on my shoe rack that I need to re-evaluate. I know I have too many coats/jackets/vests. Like the Prana vest I got on clearance, and it looks really cute, but when I sit I can't breathe....lol. (and, just because I'm removing my stuff doesn't give him license to fill up the areas, because they are my areas).

Yesterday I brought a box to the entryway and started to actually look at the stuff in my spaces and put stuff in the box.

This morning I concentrated on one shelf in the pantry. I found open boxes of cereal from 2017 and 2020. I didn't taste them, I just decided to toss them. I realized that the shelf isn't a good spot for food, but a great spot for seldom used appliances. I might ask my neighbor if she wants the open cereal for her squirrels. But, squirrels don't like expired nuts, not sure what they think about expired cereal.

Key realization: buying new foods to try is a major clutter source,"I created a good organizational system for my pantry, with containers for each family member and then for categories of food.

Well, the containers are doing their job in the sense of ""to control or restrain"" because it helped me realize that I would buy a new ingredient or a cool-looking treat for the first time, and then not really like it, and it would just sit in there, getting buried under other grocery experiments because I'd think ""I might eat/use those,"" when I'm really not going to.

So, I'm doing two things to help keep things uncluttered:

* I'm going to stick to buying tried and true stuff, unless I know I have extra space for an experimental food
* I'm letting myself off the hook to throw things away. Sometimes it's OK to see a treat at Trader Joe's, think ""that looks so yummy,"" and then not actually like it and get rid of it!",declutter,1738087453.0

How to approach family who desperately need to (time sensitively) declutter.,"Hey all. First post here, sorry if this isn't the right place. Delete it if I've screwed up, with apologies. I'll jump to it:

Late-60s family member married a lovely lady a couple years back of about the same age.  He has acquired many things over decades with raising children and then primarily raising his grandchildren, so for many years his house has largely been considered ""full of stuff"". No hoarding, Just lots of, y'know, stuff. Livable but almost no extra space.

Cut to the wife's house which is the same, only her clutter is also extremely unorganized. (There was no rush to sell her place after the wedding, so they slept on it until this year.)  I'd call her place not-quite hoarding, the house is still technically livable, but the stuff-level is very stress inducing.

They are in the process of ""merging"" the two houses. I'm stressed even thinking about it. Beyond the fact that it's mathematically impossible to put the stuff from one into the other, never mind the fact that 3 people will live there (her son is on the spectrum). I don't think they understand the gravity of the situation about how much stuff there really is and how unhealthy it's going to be turning the house into a no-space storage facility.

I'm just a nobody freelancer family member so I have no weight to pull and I'm a giant nobody.  I want to help, but I have almost nothing to offer. This situation is going to get extremely messy as they could probably lose at least a couple tons of stuff and they wouldn't notice. There's no way a stager would do anything with the house except look at it and say ""call me when this place is empty."" I have no idea how to approach this situation as I know the wife ""doesn't want anyone going through my stuff"" and ""I'll need to go through it myself before I get rid of anything.""

Any suggestions?  How to talk to family? Where can they go? Things to suggest to them? Anyone been in a situation like this?",declutter,1738124008.0
How do you guys motivate when you want to get a pile of stuff done but you feel either stuck in making decisions or you just don‚Äôt want to do it?,"I feel like self-discipline with decluttering comes more easily to some people than others. For some people it‚Äôs more of a practical thing, finding the time and the space and then they can do it. But for others it‚Äôs more of an emotional thing, being sentimental, or having stuff from loss. Or for some, it‚Äôs a cognitive thing, like trouble organizing, or starting, or categorizing, etc. maybe there are other ones too that I‚Äôm not thinking of.

I‚Äôm wondering what you guys do when you feel stuck in any of those categories to push through the blockage! It‚Äôs not enough to just tell myself that I want to get it done and I need to get it done and I should do it because that‚Äôs all true but that doesn‚Äôt change anything. 

I know that part of it is these are the things where I have trouble making decisions or I don‚Äôt know where to put them. So I hesitate because like not wanting to ‚Äúenter the stuck zone.‚Äù Things where the decision is more clear is so much easier!",declutter,1738124428.0
Holding onto mistakes,"Recently I thought about all the posts and comments with some variation of ‚Äúwhat if I need it, I could use it, but I spent money on it‚Äù and had a personal realization. 

If I bought a bag of spinach because I wanted it for a recipe and then it went bad in the fridge, I would not hold onto it forever because I ‚Äúcould have‚Äù used it or meant to or spent money on it. 

I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs $3 wasted and toss it, or add to my compost bin to recycle it. I don‚Äôt worry about giving bad spinach to someone else or feel tons of guilt about what could have been (a chickpea, sweet potato and spinach curry I was too tired to make).

That feels easy. So why would I hold onto the make up item I hated and don‚Äôt use or the piece of clothing that didn‚Äôt fit right or the terrible notebook?

This came up because about 2 years ago I bought a $4 dresser at an online auction and its condition was a lot worse than expected. It‚Äôs been in my garage so I could strip off the veneer and‚Ä¶ do something with it. But I‚Äôve come around to accepting that I don‚Äôt want to invest time in this $4 junky dresser. I could just toss it. 

So I‚Äôm offering that thought for anyone who struggles to let go. If you wouldn‚Äôt hang onto bad food just because you paid money for it, why are you holding onto ______ when it‚Äôs not serving your needs?


ETA: it‚Äôs not about the *physical* condition of the spinach y‚Äôall. It‚Äôs the process of acknowledging that I had good intentions, spent the money and the time for using that thing has passed. It may be easier to see in wilty, slimy lettuce but the process of letting go is very similar. ",declutter,1738164016.0
Inspirational quote I saw,"I saw this this weekend and thought wow that's inspirational. Need to share.

""When you are decluttering, and can't let go of an item, ask yourself.

Am I holding onto this for the life I thought I'd have, or the life I am creating.""

Makes it easier to let go if we are saving it because we thought we'd be thinner, or we thought we'd be a seamstress, or we thought we'd be a musician.  But if we realize, we are happy the weight we are or we'll buy nice clothes if we do lose weight, or we frankly hated sewing, or would rather watch a concert than be in one, then we no longer need that item for the life we are creating.

My boyfriend and I are getting in fights about decluttering my stuff?,"My boyfriend (23) and I (22) have been together for 6 years, not living together, no plans to live together in the next year as we want to save up first. I have a history of keeping things people have given me because I feel bad getting rid of them, and bf has given me several gifts throughout the years. A lot of them are fandom related items, for shows and hobbies I‚Äôm just not into anymore. I also have a lot of stress built up from just overall having way too much stuff. 

Now bf and I almost never get into fights, more or less serious talks or light bickering. One day, I was getting rid of a bunch of clothing and bringing it to a local consignment shop, and I asked him for a ride. He of course said yes as he loves this shop, and off we went. As I opened the trunk to get the boxes of clothes and shoes I was bringing, he asked to look through them. Not seeing the harm I said sure, I assumed he was looking for something his sister might like, and her and I have given each other clothes before. He pulls out a pair of anime themed shoes out of the box and says ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not getting rid of these.‚Äù And confused, I asked him why? He got me those shoes one year for Christmas, and I hadn‚Äôt worn them in over a year since they just weren‚Äôt my style anymore. He very sternly told me that he spent a lot of money on them, and that he didn‚Äôt care that I didn‚Äôt wear them but that he still wanted me to keep them anyways. This went back and forth for about 10 minutes, nearly developing into a screaming match. It ended with him saying that if I‚Äôm not going to keep them, he will until I ‚Äúultimately want them again.‚Äù 

6 months later, I‚Äôm still stuck with these damn shoes, and now I‚Äôm worried about giving away more things he‚Äôs given me, in fear of starting an argument. It almost feels like he is hoarding my stuff, and it‚Äôs very much stopping me from moving forward. Now to be clear I don‚Äôt want to get rid of everything he has gotten me, there are gifts I‚Äôve gotten from him that I still adore. However I‚Äôve outgrown many of said things, as we were in our late teens when we started dating, and now we are both adults. Do you guys have any thoughts on this? I would love some insight.

Bathroom decluttering help! - a mantra or rules to follow??,"I have a big cabinet in the bathroom full of medications/beauty products/the usual, and for some reason, I‚Äôm having the hardest time decluttering it. It‚Äôs really helpful to me to have ‚Äúrules‚Äù to follow to take out the decision making/attachment. 

Expired medications - toss, right? Can they just go straight in the trash?

Makeup - does it really expire? Should I just toss it all? Most are barely used. Can lipstick be kept if I sanitize it? Eyeshadow? Pressed powder? I don‚Äôt wear makeup daily (SAHM) but like to have options for special events. 

Skin care - toss it all if it‚Äôs outside the ‚Äúopen jar‚Äù recommendation? Or give it a try? A lot of these are things I wanted to try (got as gifts) but had too many at once.

Travel sized things - I travel maybe once a year. But when I do, I need it. Have they all just gone bad? Do you all just buy new travel sizes each time you travel?

Hair care - do these things expire? Hair sprays, volumizers, mousses, etc?

Thrift took everything in my huge IKEA bag!!,"Hey guys! Yesterday I brought an extremely heavy blue ikea bag full to the brim of special occasion clothes and shoes that I knew I wouldn't wear again but was holding on to... wait for it... just in case (shudder). Many of the clothes were gifted to me but did not flatter me, plus I had already done the mandatory wear-to-an-event-and-make-sure-to-get-a-picture-in-it ordeal. The shoes were beautiful platforms but man did they HURT! I found myself not even wanting to try them on for the last time before making the decision to keep or not, so obviously that was a sign that it was time for them to go.

When I say the bag was heavy I mean HEAVY. 20-25 pounds for sure. Would have probably dislocated my shoulder carrying it in if I wasn't a gymrat and didn't know how to properly support carried weight lol. The thrift took about 2.5 hours to make their buying estimate (this is  important), plus there were more buyback hauls before me in line, so by the time I got the call to come review their offer, I had forgotten most of what was in that bag. Or, rather, I had already mentally parted with the items.  

So here's the biggest success of this story: I did not look through the pile of what they decided to take (everything, yay!) unlike every other time I had sold to them. In the 2.5 hours it took them to review my things, I accepted the fact that they were no longer going to be mine. I did not pick anything out that I thought I was being offered too little for to try to continue selling online on my own.

Then went through our current cabinet where we keep all that kinds of stuff to sort it out and put it in the correct bins.

Right before the pandemic, I had done a declutter and stocked up on medicines, and apparently we have been very healthy for the last 5 years, because I had almost a 1/3 of a trash can full of expired medications!  Now I have empty bins. :)

Decluttering Old Journals & Papers that are filled with Ideas and Stuff that Inspired Me.,"I have a lot of old journals, index cards, planners and torn sheets of paper on which I‚Äôve scribbled ideas for the future, things I am interested in or just random things that inspired me. I want to sort through all these and consolidate them into a scrapbook or binder for an inspiring reference book but when I look at the sheer volume of the project I become overwhelmed. I pulled out a basket of loose papers and index cards last night and after a minute just set it back on the shelf because there is so much of it!

Friday 15: Socks and tights!,"This week, we're anticipating the February clothing challenge by tackling your sock drawer! This is your opportunity to practice the Seven F's of clothing decluttering in a low-stakes project. Go through your socks and keep only items that fit all seven F's. (If this leaves you with no socks, keep a few of the least-bad and schedule some shopping.)

1. **Fits now** or will in the future. Those socks you hate because they're tight in the calf? They need to go.
2. **Fixes** are not needed. Tights won't spontaneously unladder.
3. **Feels good** to wear. You are encouraged to be picky. Make your feet happy!
4. **Flatters** in cut and color. If it makes your feet or legs look weird, it can go!
5. **Functions** for situations that actually happen in your life. If you have a vast cache of thin, sheer dress socks that you used to wear to an office, but a life where you only wear jeans with athletic socks, it's time to cut back on the dressy socks. 
6. **Flexible** to combine with other items into multiple outfits. If you are intentionally collecting fancy socks, you can waive this criterion. However, for ordinary sock-wearing, your socks should be colors that go with things in your wardrobe.
7. **Favorites** if you have a large number of similar items. For socks, this is mostly about ditching the pairs that you actively avoid wearing because they just *annoy* you for some reason not covered in the first six F's.

You can pursue various trash-to-treasure projects for unwanted socks, but don't transfer your sock-drawer clutter to cleaning-rag clutter, craft-fabric clutter, or random-household-item clutter. It is probably simpler to donate unwanted socks in good condition and trash (or send to fabric recycling) damaged socks.

"Company that accepts donated old photos, is it legit","First of all thanks to this sub, I know I'm not alone, I'm clearing out my deceased parents' memories. They were by no means hoarders, in that their house is uncluttered and spotless, yet in the closets are boxes and boxes of paper memories. News clippings, cards, brochures from Fraternity dances, Red Cross Cards from 1948 to 2015. Expired licenses,  draft cards, letters about Honor Society induction,  programs. It's just a lot!
Not only that,  my mother was a champion runner and scrapbooked EVERY SINGLE 5K RACE SHE RAN FROM AGE 45 TO AGE 77. Every race number and her time and the race flier. There are 16 books.  There are many news articles about her breaking State Age Group records.  I've made one scrapbook from all of those articles. My dad was no slouch either he compeyed in Masters swimming and also coached for 50 years- he saved logs of 
handwritten swim times for his swim teams from every team he ever coached from 1952 to 2012. We donatedo 350 sports trophies and plaques! If I could I'll show you a photo of part of it. 

I came upon this website that accepts donations of old photos and paper memorabilia. I read the most recent locked thread on this,  about throwing out old photos where you don't know who the people are, and see no mention of it.  I guess I have hoarding tendencies cause it's been killing me to toss old stuff.  I understand they retain the rights to the photos. Is this company legit? Should I do it? I've already collected a box of stuff I'm downright giddy that I found somewhere to send it besides the landfill.

Bulk trash removal tips?,"I've been trying to declutter for a while, but one place I keep running into issues is actually getting stuff out of my house.

I have an extremely steep driveway, and a few years ago I broke my leg and tore up my ankle and had a bunch of surgeries. My level of function varies, but sometimes I can't get my trash bins down to the street on trash days. Perishable kitchen garbage gets priority for obvious reasons, but then there's no room for throwing away other clutter. Stuff I know I want to throw away, but for which I don't have trash can space.

Two potential solutions occur to me -- hiring a trash removal company to bring a truck, or renting a dumpster. The latter appeals more because I'd be able to work more slowly over time, and add more stuff once the obvious trash is out and I can see better, and not actually have to interact with people seeing the layers of junk I'm getting rid of.

Basically, I'm wondering if anyone has experience with either of those, or other advice for me on this issue! This seems like the best place.

Also, related -- with items people might be able to use, is there any way of donating where I just dump a bunch of boxes on the establishment's doorstep and run away without having to talk to anyone or explain myself? üòÖ",declutter,1738347653.0
Leveraging a calendar flip,"A month ago you may have heard lots of folks going on about the New Year and how excited they were for a fresh start. Annnnd most people have abandoned their resolutions already üòÇ

BUT what if we took that concept into each and every new month (or week)?

Tomorrow is February and a fresh start, 4 perfect weeks to try a new habit, work on consistency or restart a goal. Instead of waiting 334 days to start new, do it now!

If it‚Äôs easier, consider each week or day a fresh start, for me monthly works well because I always overestimate what I can do in a day and underestimate what I can accomplish in a month. 

There‚Äôs a quote I really love that goes, ‚ÄúFinish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could. Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can.

Moms who have/had cleaners. Is it worth it?,"Decluttering has changed my life in a way that it doesn't really take more than 30 minutes to clean a bathroom or more than 10 minutes to wipe counters and mirrors. It doesn't take more than 20 minutes to tidy toys in order to get ready for a robot vacuum pass. I feel like despite all of the efforts decluttering and organizing I still can't catch my breath on weekends. I still clean, do laundry, try to catch up on dishes and do very light cooking. I used to cook all meals from scratch (before kids), well, not anymore. I have a feeling that if I had cleaners I would spend more time cooking and connecting with kids but at the same time I don't see a reason why I need to spend $200-350 per clean (US dollars) when it doesn't take much time. I spent $800 on a deep clean as a reward for completing decluttering of all areas but I don't see spending that much money being sustainable. What do you all do to stay on top of a clean house with kids but also don't fall behind on work commitments (my husband and I work full-time corporate jobs) and spending time with family? We don't have parents to watch kids within 4000 miles distance (they live across the ocean) or a babysitter. Kids are almost 6 and almost 2 years old.

"February Challenge: Clothing, Shoes, Accessories!","Our February challenge is clothing, shoes, and accessories! For your normal wardrobe (leaving out specialized gear like snowsuits or bridesmaids dresses for upcoming weddings), every item you keep should fulfill seven F‚Äôs.

**The seven F‚Äôs**

1. Fits now, or will in the near future.
2. Fixes are not needed. (If you intend to make minor repairs, February 28 is your deadline!)
3. Feels good to wear.
4. Flatters in color and cut.
5. Functions for situations that actually happen in your life. 
6. Flexible to combine with other items for multiple outfits.
7. Favorite if you have a large number of similar items. (If you have 17 blue shirts but only wear 3, what are your plans for the other 14?)

If an item fails *any* of the seven F‚Äôs, it is ready to leave your home. This means the top in a gorgeous color that feels scratchy and doesn‚Äôt fit right is *leaving.* The thing you were excited about buying, but in five years, you‚Äôve never found shoes that work with it?

"Decluttering clothes, nearing the end of the tunnel","I‚Äôve gone through a major clothes declutter this year as I need new clothes that fit me and that I actually like, so far I‚Äôve tackled: jackets/coats, underwear+socks etc, pjs, tops, jumpers, jeans and today was a hard one: skirts and dresses.
It was hard because it was something I‚Äôve been putting off for a while, years ago I loved how skirts looked on me and would fawn over possible outfits I could do, which I had most items for, but did I wear them? Rarely.
I realized this mistake too late and hanged onto these items thinking ‚Äúone day‚Ä¶‚Äù this also went for dresses.
So today I wanted to be sure I wasn‚Äôt cluttering my space with items that didn‚Äôt fit so I tried everything on, I already did a declutter last year(?) so I didn‚Äôt have that much and I did already get rid of some dresses recently that I hated the feel of.
The ones that didn‚Äôt fit immediately had to go, that was easy, but what wasn‚Äôt easy were the skirts that did fit.
For these I had to consider other factors that I‚Äôve been strongly considering while buying clothes recently: does it fit well? Am I truly comfortable wearing this?
And the answer was no, I wasn‚Äôt comfortable at all, the skirts were too short for me to imagine wearing comfortably, and I probably thought the same all these years where I was avoiding wearing them.
Last item, a sentimental dress, it was my first dress (after childhood) and I had a lot of emotions attached to it, I felt so pretty in it, I imagined myself wearing it to some events, I did wear it to a party of a friend who passed away and I remember my dad complimented me in it, I‚Äôm struggling to let go of it but part of me thinks it‚Äôs time since it doesn‚Äôt quite fit well (edit: the top part is too small for me) and it‚Äôs still too short for my comfort, I am considering different options if to keep it (for anyone that can fit in it) or not but as for me I can‚Äôt wear it, it‚Äôs the only item I‚Äôm undecided on as the rest is a sure bye bye.
Next and last items to tackle: shoes and accessories, then I‚Äôm done with my clothes.

How to deal with a collection,"Hello everyone,

So I've be actively decluttering for a year and a half and have done a lot of progress. I couldn't believe how much i had accumulated. I've decluttered every where i could : basement, kitchen, bedroom and clothes, shoes, books, miscellaneous, etc. I keep telling myself : have I used this / enjoyed this last year ? No ? Out it goes.

But here's my problem. When i was younger and around my teenage years i collected a lot of plushies. I already got rid of at least 50% of them and ended up creating two bags : old ones / sentimental ones and the nice / cute ones. Now i feel completely blocked by those plushies. I'm 26 and it might seem odd to not be able to get rid of childish stuff bur i feel very attached to those plush toys. But i still have too many. I can't store them all and if they are stored i can't really say I'll enjoy them properly. 

I need help / advice and motivation so i can go through those 2 bags. I am surprisingly at a loss when it comes to this subject and decluttering. 

Thanks.",declutter,1738433546.0

Please help me to get started,"Evening all, 

I am stuck. I've been stuck for a few years now, but circumstances are only getting worse and now I can't see the wood for the trees. 

My house is a pit of despair. Overcluttered, untidy, falling apart at the seams. Both a direct reflection of my inner mental state, and also one of the main sources of my overwhelm and dysregulation. 

I want to hire a massive skip and throw everything away but I can't afford one, and even if I could, I'm afraid of getting started - most likely because whenever I've tried to declutter in the past, I have end up getting stuck on the value (monetary/personal/usefulness) of individual items and keeping way more than necessary. 

My kids and I are at home all of the time, and our wellbeing suffers because of the constant mess and overstimulation, as well as my own shame for not being able to stay on top of things. I don't have any outside support.

I'm desperate for someone to point me in the right direction. I've paid for outside help before but it has barely made a dent, and I've asked various AI apps for schedules/tips. I struggle with all or nothing thinking and the negative side of perfectionism. 

Please can someone tell me what to do? Even just the first step? I can't let this get any worse but I currently feel powerless against the tide.

Recycling books instead of donating,"I am in a bit of a dilemma about how to declutter books. I have already got rid of a lot via charity shop donations.

I have ADHD and have been studying or working from home for five years. 
I also own A LOT of stuff.

And I have!

The shelves arrived this Friday and are now up and filled! 

I unfortunately don‚Äôt have a great before picture (but I‚Äôm sure you can imagine what it looked like.) but I have so partial ones and pictures of the process, here:

I‚Äôve thrown out three moving boxes of books, donated three big bags of stuff, tried every single pen I own and thrown out the bad ones and so much more. 

I‚Äôve thrown out and consolidated enough things that I can throw out five plastic baskets, two huge plastic tubs, two metal baskets and two carts. 

I also bought some plastic tubs to sort stuff in from a store with a one year return window so I can return them now that I no longer need them. (Yes, yes, I know I probably shouldn‚Äôt have but they have absolutely no signs of wear since they‚Äôve just been temporary storage places.) 

‚Äî

I can now SEE my kitchen table that has served me as a desk for five years. 

I‚Äôve even organized all my instruction manuals in plastic folders in binders instead of in a pile in a kitchen cabinet. 

‚Äî


I‚Äôm not quite done, I still have two empty drawers to fill up and I haven‚Äôt decided what to put in them yet. 

Is my home now perfectly clean and minimalistic? Absolutely not!
I WANT to have my books and quirky decorative items visible. 

A lot of people will probably find my apartment very cluttered and chaotic but it is SO much better than it was! 

I have a small apartment, many hobbies and a lot of things. Minimalism isn‚Äôt really on the table üòÇ

I've had a successful Sunday,"Decided to have a 'get stuff done' day today because I've concentrated on my recent visitors and not done too much around the house over the last week. I made my To Do List last night. 

First on the list was my very own 'clutter corner'. It's out of sight and it's become the little spot that I can quickly shove stuff out of the way. Except it's now piled up with stuff that should really have been sorted. Sorting complete, random items thrown away, other bits put away and a couple of items listed on Vinted. 

Logging into Vinted led me to review the things I've already got listed (this sub has so many discussions about list vs. donate) and I decided to remove all the old stuff and stick it straight into a donate bag. The new stuff will be given a couple of weeks at most then I'll accept my sunk cost and take them to the charity shop to get them out of the house. I feel better having finally arrived at a balance that I'm comfortable with. Let's see how that goes üòÅ 

Next came clearing the bits that have been abandoned on my cabinets. Pairs of sunglasses that had no home.....because I've got too many crappy random pairs for my cases. Not any more - 5 old pairs in the bag, current glasses sorted and put away. 

I've already made my list for tomorrow which includes a trip to drop off donations, and a little sort through of my scarf rack and handbags. 

My intention is to plan at least one activity each day - whether it's a major one or minor. This has come from time spent with my sister who is finding it really tough to reclaim the space in her house. She still has three boxes of tools in her living room that no-one wants and she's had them since we cleared my dad's home 5 years ago when he passed away. I realised that every suggestion I made to try to help her, equally applied to me even though my space and mental place is nothing like hers. I just don't always feel motivated to do things sometimes (ok, I can't be arsed sometimes...there I said it!), so the one action a day appeals to me as I like to feel I've achieved SOMETHING at the end of the day. 

Anyway, I hope you've all had a good day. I just wanted to share my little lightbulb moment in case it helps anyone who might be feeling that it always has to be a big project to get anywhere. It doesn't - just one little action a day might help you to start. X",declutter,1738523021.0

"Books: Donate to local library, or sell to Book Off?","Question above. I have a LOT of books to declutter (especially manga), and I'm debating if I just want to take them all to Book Off or just take them to my local library. The thing is, Book Off is nearly an hour drive and I'd have to make multiple trips, versus a local library right down the street. My main reservation is the loss of money (although I'm aware that once it's bought, the money and value is gone), where even if Book Off doesn't pay much it's still SOMETHING. Taking things to my library would be significantly faster and I can get back on track with my depression room declutter, though I'll admit I'm caught in between..

  
Thanks in advance, I appreciate any input or thoughts on this! ",declutter,1738531119.0
The craft sticker hoard solution,"I managed to downsize a lot of my alleged crafting hoard, much of which has been untouched for years. I got my paper materials down to a single folder, but still struggled to part with some semi-sentimental stickers that were from the 90s when I used to write actual letters to my friends. Hello Kitty etc. Stickers are a hard item to use up, I find. 

I let my toddler have access to the stash whilst I was decluttering other stuff nearby. I put out an A2 piece of paper and a bunch of pencils and just got on with filing.

This kid burned through almost all of my stickers in twenty minutes. Kid was wearing three, I got given about five to wear. Blam. Others turned out to have lost their stick many years ago. A giant collage was created. 

Later my kid said 'I need to go back to the office mummy. I'm very busy and need to do my work'. Normally this child spends any time I try to declutter shouting 'Pick me up Mummy! Stop!'

Tl;Dr - struggling to let go of stickers? Let a 2 year old ruthlessly help. They will enjoy it and you will probably feel relieved.",declutter,1738533543.0

Came Across a Letter from My Late Father That Upset Me,"I've been spending half an hour a day sorting through files, and I'm starting to make some progress. Today, though, I found a letter that my father wrote me 50 years ago that upset me. I was thinking about going to grad school at the time, and needed a form signed by him that he would guarantee the tuition. He had always done this, and had never in my whole life made me feel that he regretted the arrangement, but the tone of this letter was quite different. I didn't remember the letter at all, so it was quite a surprise.

In the end, I didn't apply for grad school. With my BA in English, I found an interesting but low-pay job with a book publisher, and started my career as an editor and publisher. Later I switched to business, and completed an MBA that I paid for myself. Nothing really stalled, and my dad didn't have to finance the second, more expensive degree.

I didn't spend too much time on the letter, and threw it away, so that's a success, but it has left me feeling unsettled and a little sad. ",declutter,1738541903.0

Made progress this weekend.,"I don‚Äôt know if anyone would remember some of my previous posts, but I‚Äôve been working on cleaning out my bedroom. I had piles of to do stuff all along the walls on the floor, had a pile of 6+ blankets on the floor, and boxes and totes filled of sewing stuff all over.  It‚Äôs a small room, about 10x10, so there was a lot of clutter.

I had been working on my clothes too, one category at a time and have made my way through all my clothes with the exception of work out clothes and pjs.  Working on my pjs now and will finish up with the work out clothes.  

My drawers under the bed are all half empty compared to overstuffed just a few months ago.  My side of the closet looks better and I have more room, not as much as my husband does, but I‚Äôll get there.   My shelves in the closet are much emptier and they have space for the blankets when they are no longer needed on the beds for the colder weather.   I do need to work on the headboard, ours has a couple shelves and my side is overflowing with books that I need to either get rid of or remove others on the bookshelf.  

The piles of crap are all gone!!!  I pulled all my craft stuff out this weekend and sorted, declutter and reorganized.  My bedroom floor is holding nothing except the carpet and the bed and it feels amazing!  

I honestly thought it would take most of the year to get the bedroom cleared, but I guess  I was motivated this weekend. Some of my craft totes are sitting out in another room, but I‚Äôm not allowing any of it back into the bedroom.  Either I will find a proper place for them, or they will get declutterred in the next round or two.

Question for the sentimental or those dealing with loss,"For those of you who are having trouble decluttering because of emotional attachment to the things because you‚Äôre very sentimental or because they are associated with somebody who has passed, I‚Äôm wondering what you have found that works. 

It‚Äôs a hard process. It‚Äôs not just about getting rid of things (haven‚Äôt worn in a year, don‚Äôt need, etc.). It‚Äôs about them, and not having an object they wore or purchased or gave you or things like that. 

I know it‚Äôs not giving away the person, I know there are memories, I know we can take photos, but I feel like it‚Äôs a double process, partially the practical of not keeping everything and partially the emotional, like one less part of the life you shared.

What has worked for you? One of the few things that‚Äôs worked for me sometimes is, crazy as it sounds, thanking the item for its role in the person‚Äòs life. I know Marie Kondo might say something like that, but to others it sounds bonkers. But it does sometimes help.",declutter,1738564220.0
"Yes, you can get rid of it!","If you want to know ""can I get rid of this specific thing?"", the answer is almost always YES. This is r/declutter. You can get rid of it! The exceptions are legal and financial documents that establish your rights, responsibilities, and resources.

If you're concerned about whether you can *trash* something, the answer is usually YES, but there are exceptions:

* Medicines and sharps should go to drop-off spots designated for them, often at police stations or pharmacies.
* Electronics should go to electronics recycling.
* Paints, cleaners, and other things containing volatile chemicals are often classified as ""household hazardous waste."" Check your local municipality's or region's web site for where HHW goes.
* Big bulky things may require a special pick-up, and some places charge for this. Again, check their site.
* Your locale may have specific rules about what goes in trash, recycling, composting, etc. Follow those rules.

While it's good to limit how much trash you're generating, you could clean out one of the 5-acre hoarder farms we have out here in rural California without having even a tiny fraction of the impact that a big corporation does in a single day. ",declutter,1738592783.0

What To Do With Limited Use Items,"I‚Äôm trying hard to declutter my life and clothing is a huge source of clutter for me for a number of reasons.  I‚Äôve downsized a lot over the past few months and my current collection is starting to feel more manageable.

However.

I have a lot of clothes/costumes that I wear once a year at most and have no clue what to do with them.  (For context: I‚Äôm a professional dancer and have lots of themed events throughout the year and the themes often recycle yearly or every few years.)  My problem is if I get rid of them, I‚Äôll have to re-buy the same or similar item/s on a yearly or semi-yearly basis, but if I keep it, it feels like it‚Äôs just taking up space in my (better, but still cramped) closet 99% of the time.

What would you do with things you *actually know* you‚Äôll need but don‚Äôt necessarily have space for?  (Currently a storage unit is out of the budget and last time I had one, it was an ‚Äúout of sight, out of mind‚Äù resource that allowed me to throw everything I didn‚Äôt want to face into and nothing got solved.)",declutter,1738609889.0
digital decluttering,"I hope this type of post belongs here. I got a new phone and transferred my data over, as one does. I decluttered a lot of files, pictures, photos, whatnot.

I know I don't need to carry them all around in my pocket but I'm afraid that some day the old phone may never turn on again and I'll lose the 6+ years of conversations. I know with digital storage it's important to keep copies in different places, cloud backup, external storage. The idea of deleting it or losing it tugs on my heartstrings.

I posted earlier and mods removed it. I am asking for actual advice on how to break a seemingly huge task down. 

I can‚Äôt do it every single day due to work schedule.

Finally getting rid of my old uni textbooks.,"Once upon a time, when I was a teenager, I had dreams of becoming a doctor. Long story short, I soon realised that I only liked the *idea* of that dream, and simply couldn't cope with the reality of the study load and part-time work. I wasn't even 2 years into my pre-med degree, and I was burnt out and stressed. I liked the idea of working full-time, with no study - just to be able to lock the door behind me, come home, and rest my brain. So I swallowed my pride and quit.  

Many years and a family later, and I still had all my old textbooks in the cupboard. We had dragged them along with us through 5 house moves and today, when I couldn't find something unrelated that I had put away somewhere, I decided enough was enough.  

Too much crap in this house that I've been clinging onto. Would I ever use these textbooks ever again? Probably only in an apocalypse to add extra bullet-proofing to a wall cavity, maybe. Would my kids be able to use them in the future? Not unless I want to make them struggle through using 20 year old textbooks. Is there a buy-back program? Unlikely for books this old. And even if there was, it would probably cost more to send them off considering how heavy they all are. Why not donate to a library? Again, there are probably tons of books that are much newer and more useful for anyone needing one.  

So I'm taking the chance now, with bin day tomorrow (and the bin isn't full to the top for a change), to finally get rid of them ALL.  

It'll be nice to finally open the cupboard and no longer have to be reminded of my academic failures every single time. And that's worth more to me than any amount of money I'd be able to get back from (somehow miraculously) being able to sell them.

After decluttering my clothes I‚Äôve decided to swap out the contents of the junk skubb to a bigger skubb (I‚Äôve bought them all after measuring my space available so it was planned before), at first I was annoyed that would mean less space for my house clothes but I managed to put all my t-shirt in one separate skubb so it makes the house clothes skubb less packed and a bit less daunting, also that meant something great: now all my clothes are in the wardrobe, with only my coats and my pjs in separate areas, and the junk skubb was the one above my bed since I reach for it less, why didn‚Äôt I think of this before?


After this I realized I was done with my clothes decluttering, the only things that need possible sorting are 2 pairs of trousers and 2 jackets but otherwise I was done, I had tackled my shoes and was delighted to see some trainers I really liked still looking good.


So now it all hit, yes I was done with my clothes but the rest of the room looks like a mess, my new Vinted clothes I have to wash are on the floor in bags (I‚Äôm washing them bit by bit), my desk looks like a mountain, and some shelves look like a hazard, and the most annoying thing close to me: my bedside table thing (similar to an IKEA malm but with wheels) has been getting on my nerves for a long time, I had organized it several times but I would never put the stuff back where it belonged, why was that? 


And this is when the payoff started, organizing my wardrobe, including my junk skubb trickled over to the visible mess.


I have 3 drawers on my bedside thing, first 2 had a load of cute pouches, wallets etc and the last one had my technology things like my pc, cables, iPad etc which was bursting, I was ‚Äúinspired‚Äù to put my pouches in there by videos of people having these drawers dedicated to them and I thought ‚Äúoh how cute, that way I will definitely use them often if they‚Äôre in easy reach!‚Äù And I didn‚Äôt.


So here comes the junk skubb with that famous extra space to the rescue: all those pouches and things I barely picked up went in there so I could reach for them only if I really needed them and now I had space again in my bedside drawers! 


I was tempted to just move the stuff from my shelves in there to free up that shelf space and my mind was racing with ideas of what else to dedicate those drawers to when I realized that is my bedside drawer, I need that for things I need near my bed, not other things I‚Äôll barely reach for, why find other ways to clutter it when the answer was there all along?


So I sorted all that mess on top of it, I have a small cloth sorting thing on top where I put all my annoying cables (it‚Äôs closed so they‚Äôre not on show) and moved the original content of it in my drawers, it annoyed me at first because it felt disorganized and like if I was creating new junk drawers but listen, it‚Äôs OK to have junk drawers! 


It‚Äôs normal to have bits and bobs that don‚Äôt need a whole space for them individually.


I managed to move some of the technology drawer stuff to another drawer, now I don‚Äôt have it all piling and barely closing, I can actually use these drawers again instead of them being storage!


So, that‚Äôs that, a small victory but big for me, it pushed me to ignore the mindset of using these spaces for storage rather than functionally to my everyday needs, because as much as I value storage, it gets in the way if I can‚Äôt put other things that belong in that space away. 


I‚Äôm happy I‚Äôve finished for now with my clothes, I‚Äôve donated a lot of bags that I clearly had no patience reselling, it makes me happy to know at least some parts of the room are organized and it motivated me to finally see results.

Clothing Declutter: What are the right questions?,"I‚Äôm sorry if this has been discussed before! I‚Äôm curious to hear this community‚Äôs thoughts: What are the absolute BEST questions that I should be asking myself with each item of clothing during a declutter beyond just ‚ÄúDoes this spark joy?‚Äù? I‚Äôm in the process myself and need more motivation from y‚Äôall. I‚Äôm looking for both practical and philosophical questions. I‚Äôve been asking myself the following:
1) Does this spark joy? 
2) Will I wear this again? 
3) Does this fit perfectly? 
4) If I saw this at a store today, would I buy it? 
5) Have I worn this in the last 6 months?

Friday 15: Take 5 items from your wardrobe!,"For today's Friday 15, pull out five items that fail one of the first four of the Seven F's of clothing:

* **Fit:** It doesn't fit and won't fit any time soon. 
* **Fixes** needed are more elaborate than you can take on.
* **Feel** is bad (scratchy, itchy, binds, etc.)
* **Flattering** you in color and fit isn't happening.

We're concentrating on only four of the seven F's this time because these are the ones that don't call for thinking about the broader context of your life or how your clothes work together. Take these five garments and put them straight into the donation bag without making excuses for them!

I got rewarded for donating stuff,"I had a ton of kids clothes that my kids had grown out of. We're always low on money, so I planned to sell the clothes online. But I never got around to doing it. I got sick of those boxes and decided to just give them away for free. That's when I learned that a nice or nephew is in planning. So my sibling came over to look through the clothes and I talked them into taking a lot. They were super grateful and in return they got my daughter some stuff we still needed for her daycare start. 


I still had one box left, so I called my aunt, who usually always knows someone. She told me that sadly all the kids she knows are too big for what I have to offer, but she recommended a charity store. I know the ""charity"" stores around here. They take donations, sell them for ridiculous high prices and pocket the money. So I checked out the stores website and it turns out it's a non-profit and that due to our low income I can apply for a voucher. I went to the main office, provided the paperwork and got my voucher. I can get up to 60 pieces of clothes for free (15 per family member). The voucher is active till June and in July I can apply for my next 60 pieces voucher. 


So I went to the charity store, dropped off my donation and strolled through the aisles. My son needed some shirts in the next size anyways. I found two nice shirts for him and one for my daughter. It felt weird to use my voucher instead of paying, but I told myself ""I donated a big box of clothes, I deserve to take the three pieces of clothes for free in return"". 


If I had tried to sell the kids clothes, I had to put hours of work into it, putting it online and waiting months for someone to ask for it. Next the haggling, shipping and all for a fraction of what's actually worth it. Instead I gave it away for free, saved myself the stress, got my living space back in no time and was rewarded with a voucher that I actually have use for and stuff for my daughter that I wouldn't have been able to afford this month.

Still making good progress!,"So as I've posted before, I am trying to go through the storage unit of all my mom's stuff from her apartment (she moved to skilled nursing to one room). This week, I brought about 8 boxes of stuff home to go through. I managed to go through it all.

Some was repacked for donations, which I'm hoping to drop off tomorrow

Some was condensed and repacked to go into MY storage - certain things she wants to keep, and as I have the space, I am ok with that.

Some things were added into MY apartment, things I like, and will use.

And finally, some things were just tossed. My mom, while not a hoarder, or even a packrat, was a saver. She was also very handy; could rewire lamps, she also matted and framed pictures and other things, and made and repaired jewelry. so she had a lot of stuff relating to all that.

Her picture matting and framing stuff I donated last year to the activity department in her retirement community.

some of the other stuff, if new and unopened, is being donated, some I kept, and a lot of it, various nails, screws, fastners, etc., in small ziplocks, just got trashed. there was so much of it, and half of it I had no clue what it was for.

I also went through her sewing stuff. She wants to keep her machine, even though I am pretty sure she will never use it again, but its ok. I went through that, and tossed a LOT of half empty needle packets, am donating 3 of 4 pincushions, etc. 

So slowly, but surely, I am going through and dealing with everything. My goal is to bring a few boxes a week home, deal with them, and then bring more, and repeat.

And in doing all of this, little by little, my apartment doesn't look like an episode of hoarders, and I can actually keep it fairly clean and neat!",declutter,1738937086.0
How to actually declutter my house with kids? When I am too attached,"Hello

Basically I‚Äôm in a worm hole of giving up. My house is chaotic. My garage is full. Every room is full. I spend days sorting things out and I can‚Äôt seem to actually see the stuff it get rid of. My house can be tidy and within a few hours it gets trashed. I have a 4 year old and a 6 month old and stuff is just accumulating. 

I really want to get on top of it, not just for my mental health but also this is not how I want my children to grow up. But I just don‚Äôt know how. 

A few points 
- I am currently undergoing extensive medical testing for chronic nerve pain, muscle fatigue and weak joints, and all over pain resulting from birthing my second. So this is adding to the mess as some days I just don‚Äôt have it in me to actually pick things up I just want to sleep. 

- I grew up in an empty house. It felt unloved. My room was always full of clutter as anything of ‚Äòmine‚Äô had to be in my room or my mum would throw it. We didn‚Äôt grow up with a lot of money so I tended to buy cheaper but more things (if that makes sense). 

- I form attachments to things thinking I might need it as I don‚Äôt want to waste and re buy 

- I would prefer to sell items as financially we aren‚Äôt doing great since my diagnosis but I‚Äôm putting things of organising as I don‚Äôt know where to put them 

So yeah I‚Äôm stuck. My husband works full time and tries to help but his method to tidying is ‚ÄòI need all of my tools. But we don‚Äôt need any of anything else (including toys) let‚Äôs bin everything) 

I‚Äôm just overwhelmed and so sick of it 
I love watching minimalism videos but then when I try to empty surfaces it doesn‚Äôt feel homey. We rent so I can‚Äôt paint, or put up shelves or pictures so it just feels like I‚Äôm filling the gap with stuff. 

Anyone else had this? Any tips before I lose it?",declutter,1738963627.0
Junk drawer clean out,"Last night I was watching TV, and I felt this urge to declutter my junk drawer. It was wonderful. I put everything in one huge pile after removing everything from the drawer. I cleaned the drawer with Mr. clean gain scented spray and a microfiber towel. I then sorted ALL the items into categories. trash/tools/push pins/scotch tape/batteries/etc. I got rid of anything that was broken, old, and/or junk.  I gathered anything that might have a home in a different room, like for example a hair tie (go in my bathroom drawer) or some other hygiene item. I then decided if I have multiples of items, I paired it down to 1-2 of them and donated the rest to my elder Mom or the homeless shelter. I placed everything that I decided to keep back into the drawer. The only thing is, it all just gets messy when I close the drawer and it looks haphazard. My plan is: buying those drawer containers. I like the look of the acrylic ones but the bamboo (more expensive) might look better with the blonde color wood I have in my drawer. I feel like I‚Äôm being too aesthetic, but I know what I like. So it‚Äôs either acrylic or bamboo drawer organizers. I‚Äôm excited to organize my pantry next. I want everything to look nice. ü´∂üèª‚ú®",declutter,1738966400.0

Tips for dealing with difficult categories,"I‚Äôm sure one declutterer‚Äôs struggle is another one‚Äôs ‚Äúeh that one‚Äôs easy‚Äù.

I‚Äôm currently stuck at paperwork. I don‚Äôt have that much of it, but there‚Äôs definitely excess and I seem to be going over it again and again, only decluttering a bit on each pass. I‚Äôm afraid of tossing something that may be important later, plus paperwork takes little space physically but a lot mentally, so I‚Äôm pretty exhausted. I also know that if I don‚Äôt declutter it will tend to accumulate exponentially so I also don‚Äôt want to box it up and leave for later.

Another category I struggle with is medical supplies. I have a shit ton of medicine just in case, and a whole selection of various bandages and bandaids. Like a lot. I‚Äôve always been excessive with stocking OTC medicine, but now I have a toddler and live in a place where pharmacies close early, so it‚Äôs a bit of a neurosis that I might need something and will have to wait until next business day.

Just wanted to say Thanks!,"My mom has always been somewhat a hoarder for sentimental stuff which she passed on to us kids. I've always been very sentimental of things, like I still had toys from when I was a baby. 

When my dad passed away in 2020 and my mom didn't want to go back to the house, we decided to sell the house. It was all kind of quick, so my siblings and I made a first sweep and took things we wanted and put the rest in storage so we can properly go through everything.I was grieving, panicking and not thinking straight and took way more than I needed. I did take things that i did need and still use today but a lot of it was sentimental stuff. 

I'm finally at a better place in my life mentally and physically. I looked around my one bedroom apartment and felt claustrophobic for the first time. Started lurking on this sub since August. I read the struggles because I related to them and I read all of the advice given. I have been kicking butt with declutterring which in turn inspired my siblings to started doing the same thing.

How can I possibly do this after watching Toy Story?!,"The rite of passage every kid and/or teenager goes through. They want to throw away their old toys but they feel bad after watching Toy Story.

I have a bunch of toys everywhere but my problem is that I don't really love them. They're just collecting dust and it's causing more stress.

My ""breaking point"" wasn't until I was looking for a container to store my makeup, until I realized that I was using my American Girl Doll's clothing drawer.

Didn't Jessie go through something similar in Toy Story 2? I just feel scared to donate my old toys because Jessie was donated, and it really messed her up. I'm also scared that wherever my toys end up, there's gonna be a Lotso there...

Help me to get rid of some of my kids stuff - mindset problem,"My head says ""it's not mine, so I have no business in throwing it out"". My child can't tell me if it's ok to get rid of it cause of some minor development issues. However they have two rooms, one bedroom and one playroom and it's a mess. Some stuff needs to leave. 


Let me share an example. The dentist came to their daycare and as a reward for being brave all kids got a toothbrush, toothpaste and a bag. Every kid got the same bag, same design. The bag is this somewhat cheap plastic with strings that cut into your hand or shoulders if it's packet too heavy. Back in my days we used those bags to carry our sports or swim gear, but honestly my kids deserve better than that. Also if we'd use it as a sports bag, I guarantee I have to call other parents every now and then to get the right bag back. It's just not worth the stress. We also don't have use for it at home. It's just laying in a box, collecting dust. 


It's not worth it to keep - but it's not mine. I have this mindset from my mom, but she also has an attic full of kids stuff that she doesn't dare to get rid of cause ""it belongs to my kids"". Us, her kids, don't even remember what belonged to whom. We wouldn't miss any of those toys if she got rid of them. Sure I'd love to have the Legos or some other stuff for my kids, but it's not necessary. 


So please, help me to ease my mind. Tell me that this bag and other stuff can leave my house, even if it belongs to my kids. They wouldn't miss it, they deserve to have better stuff anyways. Please help me to make this voice of ""it's not mine"" to understand that my kids and I still have the right to have a clutter free home. ",declutter,1739084184.0
How to handle items in great condition that could be gifts?,"...but the people in your life are easily offended by hand-me-downs?

I have a few quality items that I'm not using and would love to give to people in my life that I know would use them, but most of my friends and family get offended by secondhand gifts. 

Here's some examples:

- Flat iron and curling iron set (like new)
- Teton hiking backpack (used twice)

It hurts to have these items sitting on a Goodwill shelf marked for $5. But maybe that's a good thing on the other hand, because it makes these quality items accessible to folks who may not have the opportunity to buy these items as new.

How to declutter a functional/working space?,"I need help‚Ä¶

Organized and messy person living together,"So I'm the cleaner one on the relationship and we both know it and we laugh about it. But with all seriousness how do I go about random clutter? The clutter of papers, magazines, pens, and random things on the side tables? The piles of clothes, tools, and other things on the dinning table? What I use to do when I lived alone, when I would get myself into a messy home from time to time, I'd gather all the random stuff and put it in a box and go through each item and out them in their place and if it was something I didn't need Ill toss. Now I was thinking of applying this method to my partner. Just collect their stuff and doesn't belong or is cluttering just in general (hats,glasses, towels, clothes, hardware, tools and etc) that do t belong in those spots. Im not throwing away anything but just putting it in a box a few days out the week and letting my partner know that this box is for them and the random clutter. Is that something that could work? I know you all would day to communicate with them, which have and I said I'd take care of the cleaning and they said I was able to help influence them to clean up better once I moved in. Well moving in has finally came. So anyways, would this method work for some of you or are their other ideas? Because how can we have dinner at the table if it's full of stuff? Or are there other methods you guys use?

Just curious how some of you all do it when it comes to one ""pack rat"" and one organized person. My partner isn't a hoarder, just a pack rat.

Add in the fact that my mom is one of those guilt ridden ‚Äúsomeone could use it!‚Äù types, so she meticulously combed through every belonging to post things on FB marketplace, bring to goodwill, etc. They‚Äôve technically been done with her apartment for weeks now, but my mom‚Äôs garage is now holding multiple things waiting for the right person to take it. That is all a topic for another day.

Anyway, maybe another people pleaser like me needs to hear this. If you have trouble decluttering for yourself, do it for your loved ones who will be left with the mess when you‚Äôre gone. I have no plans of going anywhere soon, but I certainly don‚Äôt want my daughters or husband struggling with so many choices and belongings of mine one day.",declutter,1739162665.0
Take your time decluttering,"Decluttering isn‚Äôt just about getting rid of stuff‚Äîit‚Äôs about letting go of attachments, memories, and the energy tied to those things. When we try to rush the process, it can feel overwhelming, and sometimes, we‚Äôre just not emotionally ready to let go.

If you‚Äôre unsure about an item, don‚Äôt force yourself to get rid of it right away. Instead, put it aside for a few months perhaps remove it from your space, put it in a storage unit, and revisit it later. More often than not, you‚Äôll realize you don‚Äôt need it, and you‚Äôll feel lighter without it.

I realized this when I put most of the things cluttering my home in a storage unit in preparation for a move. After 9 months I realized that I held onto a lot of items of obligation or guilt or just emotional ties. The separation helped me significantly, and I was able to clear out a 10x10 storage unit filled with my past. When I I returned the keys and closed the door, I was finally free. Again‚Äîthat took 9 months. 

Decluttering isn‚Äôt just about your physical space‚Äîit‚Äôs about clearing mental and emotional space too. Be kind to yourself and go at your own pace. Let go when you are ready.",declutter,1739165592.0
PTSD from others yelling at me,"This post is probably not what you expect...

I'm working on decluttering. I managed to fill a box of usable quality items to donate. It was extremely difficult because in my head I hear my ex screaming at me for giving anything away (or for doing anything/making any choice/having agency) because I should sell it, or I should want to keep it, or whatever. I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this sort of struggle with decluttering.

I myself am a materially generous person and love to give things away and make others happy. But my last boyfriend was really abusive about it. I'm just wondering if he will stop screaming in my head eventually or what. I kinda hope that once I get rid of literally any item I owned while he was in my life his memory will shut up. Have you ever dealt with this? It has been a couple of years and I am tired of it. I work through it and achieve what I try to do but it is sad and exhausting. 

I haven't been able to get a helpful therapist, the 10 I have talked to in the past year didn't offer any help, they just ignored my problem. Thank you!",declutter,1739177655.0
Decluttering old childhood games and the single thought that keeps me going,"""Someone else will be happier with this than I am with it right now"".

  
I have a lot of stuff. As a kid I absolutely loved video games and while I still enjoy it in my 30s, I've found that many ""collectibles"" I have are just unused taking up shelf space. So I've started getting rid of it.

As of right now I'm going through old gameboy stuff. Not too long ago I posted on r/Gameboy about what I found in my parents basement, and got a bunch of nice comment about my ""great collection"". Except, I get no joy from it. It's all been in a box for \~15years, and even holding the cherished childhood games in my hand didn't make me in the slightest interested in playing it again. So I've started selling it off.

Now, while selling things off do bring in some extra money, I still sometimes get the feeling that ""should I really get rid of this? After all this time?"". But then, for what? To have it in the same box for another 15 years? No, at that point it came to me.

I'm not having fun with this, but someone else will. Otherwise they wouldn't be paying $70 for a 25 year old gameboy game. And I'm way happier that it's in someone elses hands than mine. Also, given that we put so much emotional value in things, are we ""honoring"" our things by putting them in boxes in attics, basements and wardrobes? Or are we honoring them by going back to the tradition of sharing our toys with others, to whom they are an entirely new, exciting experience?

Feeling Frozen and Overwhelmed,"I took a break from decluttering awhile ago after some intense decluttering last month. I ended up donating LOTS of stuff and  schlepping much stuff into an unused room so I could focus on paring down the other rooms and only bringing back what I need. I'm having trouble with facing this room of stuff now. Every time I go in there I feel paralyzed with indecision and brain fatigue. I usually end up closing the door and pretending it doesn't exist. It feels like a big dead spot of energy within the house.

It's all stuff I kinda want, but not enough to have in my everyday space. A good majority of it will need to go to the thrift store or be discarded. I've been reading a lot about not wanting to inadvertently pass stuff on for other people to declutter. I'm trying to find something concrete enough to mentally hold onto when I go back in next time. I really want to reclaim this space and break the bonds of ""what if I need this?"" How should I tackle this? ",declutter,1739221210.0

Notes from a great first session with a declutter/organization professional today,"This time last night I was so nervous about having a professional come help me with my messy and cluttered house. I was nervous all morning. I completely lost track of time the whole time she was here because I stayed so focused. I stayed nervous/on edge the whole time, though intellectually I could tell we were making progress. It didn't feel good or satisfying until maybe an hour after we had put everything back together and she was gone. I wonder if future visits will feel better ""in the moment.""

She asked where I'd like to start. I don't know what I expected, but I didn't expect her to ask me what we should do first! I said that the three most important rooms to do are the living room, the kitchen, and the dining room, and I thought the kitchen would be too much, and the dining room had been the worst the longest, and the living room was where I spend the most time. So I decided that we would start in my living room. 

After a little over two hours, the living room was done! Really and truly done. I hadn't just shuffled stuff around. Stuff went where it was supposed to go, either in the house or into the garbage or donations. 

For the first time in my life, I took care of everything related to the trip I had just come back from the very next day after getting home. I usually drag my feet and whine about undoing all the luggage, sometimes until I have to start packing for the next trip! I dumped out bags that had been sitting for months. I dealt with mementos, some of which I was OK with throwing away, and others I put in an appropriate box out of  the way. I saw clothes I'd forgotten I had. Before today, I would have sworn that there wasn't any real trash in this room, but I found trash that was hiding underneath other stuff. 

She also helped me figure out what I needed to make the living room work. Once I got all of it out in the open, I realized I needed a book shelf and a container to hold games. So I ordered the container to hold games, bought a book shelf off of Facebook Marketplace, and my kid moved the books into their new home tonight! When the container for games arrives, it'll go where the books had been previously. 

I took out two heavy bags of trash (some of which I didn't realize was trash for the previous...many months, but with her here, I could see that it was trash). I delivered a whole box of stuff that goes to my mom's house. She took a box of donations away to drop off for me. Only a handful of items still remain that I truly don't know where they go, and when she comes back, we might have more insights on those as we address other spaces in the house (I'm thinking dining room). 

I was able to vacuum my living room, wall to wall, for the first time in over a year. It felt so good to hear that dirt getting sucked up. That was the most satisfying feeling in the whole session. 

Again, I still don't feel as happy as I imagined I might, but I feel accomplished and the upset feelings have definitely subsided. I also feel motivated to keep going, because of the success of today's accomplishments. ",declutter,1739252898.0

Day One of Declutter,"I developed an unfortunate habit out of loneliness and boredom during the pandemic and then my retirement which immediately followed it of visiting thrift stores every single week on 99-cent day.

Friday 15: Jewelry!,"This week, it's time to tackle jewelry! Pull out your jewelry boxes and do a quick sort into:

* Sentimental but you'd never wear it now = goes in a memory box, not your jewelry box.
* Unwearable in a way you can easily fix = set it aside, put a firm deadline in your calendar, and fix it.
* Broken, uncomfortable, triggers allergies, not your style, always skipped because you like a similar piece more = it leaves your jewelry box!
* Works for you and you enjoy wearing it = goes back in the jewelry box, neatly.

If you're tempted to save items for your craft stash, for your kids' dress-up boxes, etc., remember that when those fill up, you'll have to declutter them, too. If the bit of jewelry you're holding is something you already know you like less than what's in the stash or the dress-up box, skip the intermediate step and get rid of it.

Feeling overwhelmed by on onslaught of Things,"I‚Äôve been feeling SO incredibly overwhelmed recently by all the stuff we have. 

I have a toddler who has lots of toddler things. My husband has a ton of stuff that he wants to get rid of but for some reason won‚Äôt? His solution to paper clutter is to toss everything into a cardboard box and put it in a closet. My MIL is practically a hoarder and seems to want to force us into being hoarders, too. I recently scolded her for giving us more toddler books when I had already told her that we literally do not have the space. She will sneak things into our home. Who the fuck does that?? We have a full garage and a storage unit. And we recently had to clear out another space and bring a bunch of stuff into our over-crowded home. So many of those items my husband would look at it and say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand it but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs important‚Äù and put it in the closet. 

I‚Äôm drowning. 

I found Dana K White a few months ago, and she really resonates with me. I‚Äôve started doing daily tasks, like she suggests, but most days it‚Äôs all I can do to get through those. There‚Äôs very little forward momentum on the actual clutter of my home (and truth be told, almost all ‚Äúforward momentum‚Äù I make is on the crap my MIL has brought in, not on my actual possessions).

Learning a lot through this process,"I've always struggled to get rid of things, or to change in general, and this is the first big cleanout I've really done. I've been learning a lot in the process. Some things that I've learned:

* Getting rid of the thing doesn't mean getting rid of the memory. I clung to so many old things because they brought up good memories for me. And it's great to keep things that are themselves the thing I have fond memories of - I'm not going to get rid of my favorite childhood stuffed animal for example. But saying goodbye to an old tattered college shirt I can't fit into any more is not me saying goodbye to the good memories I had at college. I've been photos of things before I donate them to help preserve memories and that makes me feel a lot better.
* Keeping something that I know I won't use isn't doing anyone any favors. If I know I won't ever do this craft project, keeping it in my house just makes me feel bad and guilty. If I know I won't ever read this book, it's just taking up space on my bookshelf.
* It helped me a lot to find places where my stuff is wanted. You can google ""your town"" + recycling to see what's locally available. I found a local charity that uses donated books to help struggling youth, and I was able to bring myself to do a big closet cleanout when I found a donation bin for clothing going to refugees. A big problem for me is craft supplies and finding a local creative reuse center has been a godsend.
* I didn't want to be super wasteful and go through a ton of paper towels so I bought a pack of microfiber towels and they're awesome. They can handle just about any surface and can be thrown in the wash when you're done. I pair them mostly with a general purpose spray cleaner. Knowing that I'm not using disposable wiping tools has made me want to clean more.
* It's motivating to start with stuff that's just stuff or trash without so many emotions, and move on to the more difficult stuff later. I also find it helpful to read forums like this for a bit to motivate myself to declutter harder categories, and only work on those areas for a little while before taking a break.
* Cleaning out the crap ""honors"" your nicer stuff more.

* The people at your local big-box donation center don't really care that much about your stuff. Honestly I was really nervous taking stuff to a drop off center at my local Savers, I guess I thought they would be judging my stuff super harshly or going through things one by one or something? I realize now they're not like an antique store and as long as the stuff is in decent condition and not something they can't sell they'll take just about anything.

Edit: remembered another couple:

* It needs to have a home or it needs to go. I found I had so many things lying around the house and that was because I fundamentally didn't have a ""home"" for them to go back to. Decluttering obvious junk helps with making space, but I also realized if it was just lying around it might be time to consider whether I actually wanted it in the first place. 
* Decluttering is not the time for perfectionist organizing. I took out all my cleaning supplies from my utility cupboard and then I found I left the ones I wanted to keep out on the floor for a few days because I wasn't sure how I wanted to organize it. Of course, this led to more stress because all the stuff was still ""out"" and visible. I forced myself to just put it away in a ""good enough"" place and be done with it. I can always reorganize if I feel like it later.",declutter,1739642666.0

"rant, and why I declutter","I've only posed a few times, but almost everytime is about my MILs estate. She had a large house and worked very hard to fill it up. She was trending towards hoarder, and her art studio would officially classify as a hoarder situation. 

So far, it's taken 72 man hours to clean out the studio, to the point where the only stuff left is finished art, books, and trash. 

I'm so grateful for having friends who showed up to help. Many hands makes light work in this case. Repeatedly, they showed up week after week to help me go through everything and salvage what can be saved, make donations, arrange for pickup, everything. 

Tomorrow the dumpster arrives to take care of all the rest of the trash, and then the studio will be empty, save the finished artwork that the family still has to sort through.

This has been a horrendous and harrowing experience. The house itself has cabinets and shelves on almost every wall except the hallway. Every time her house filled up, she'd buy another piece of furniture to store more stuff. She built on 3 new rooms to extend the storage capacity. If she had lived 5 more years, the rest of the house would've become a hoarder issue, like the studio had become. 

She used to say that she's just going to ""leave us a match"" as a way to detach from the mess she left behind. Gawd that's so inconsiderate and selfish. And her friends would laugh right along with her and encourage her. It's so effing awful. She just didn't care what mess she was leaving us. It's so hard to not lose my S$%#. 

It's so awful y'all. I know you understand, which is why I'm posting here. It's the only place I can post without others saying I'm ""calling her out and being disrespectful"". 

When I talk about how I feel, so many people want me to not be angry with her. They try to explain why she was that way, I'm so sick of it. I'm tired of people trying to ""correct"" how I feel. I assume that anyone who jokes, like she did, or tries to correct my feelings has never had to do this before. 

I just don't want to do this to anyone who is left behind after I die. This is so awful. I already had to do this exact same thing with my mother's home (who had the same problem), and now I have to do it again. It's hard to contain my anger.

How to declutter ‚Ä¶. With young kids,"We have four young kiddos including a three month old. Oldest is seven. We don't have a tiny house but it's not big either for the number of us. For a while we were managing the clutter decently, but with the chaos of a new baby it just feels overwhelming. 

I am at the point where I don't even know where to start. It feels like any extra energy or time we have goes to just managing the status quo - laundry, dishes, surface cleaning. I also struggle in particular with decluttering kid stuff as we have such a range of ages. I don't like getting rid of toys that one or more kids liked because I want it to be there for the younger one(s). This leads to a lot of stuff being around. We are pretty scrupulous about toys and we do sell/donate items fairly regularly, but it seems like we can't keep up.

A lot of our clutter is just art supplies, artwork, art and craft and lego and toy projects finished and ongoing, junk toys from school (think tiny erasers, little plastic dinosaurs, etc.). The kids get quite attached to these things and I don't know how to purge them. Often I take things to the basement and if they aren't looked for in a month or two I get rid of them. 

Families with young kids, how do you manage all the clutter? How do you balance having toys and supplies and stuff on hand to play with and be creative with - with keeping your house organized and decluttered?

Moving Way from game collecting,"I've been a gamer since I was 5 years old, and a collector all my adult life. 

Over the last couple of years, I've felt my priorities begin to change. It started with me knuckling down over 2 years, working extra jobs, cutting out all unnecessary purchases and reducing my outgoings to the bare minimum. This allowed me to clear 18k worth of debt and I'm now completely debt free :) 

For the first couple of months, I treated myself to a couple of games that I've always wanted, but to be honest, they just didn't hit the same. 

During my 2 years of being extra frugal, I took up running and am now working on reaching 100 half marathons (18 in the bag as of today) I'd love to travel more, meet new people (I have a very small social circle) and basically do more with my life than sit around playing video games. 

This is a major adjustment for me, as gaming has been such a big part of my life for so long now (I'm 36 this year!) but I'm now at the stage where I want to start parting with my video game collection. 

To start this off, the first thing I did was go through all my games and identify the games I have no interest in playing (I honestly used to buy games with the idea of getting a ""Full set"" for each console. Thanks YouTube for the monkey see, monkey do game collector videos... üòÖ), or games that I have already finished and I know I won't play again. These can either go on eBay if they are worth anything or go to charity if they are only worth a couple of ¬£'s. 

As I'm currently having a ""Quiet"" year to put some savings behind me, I've turned clearing the rest of the games into a bit of a challenge... I want to practice gratitude so am playing through the games I have, taking the time to appreciate them, and then saying goodbye when I've finished them. This won't be a quick process but the number is slowly reducing every week. Having this focus also stops me from going out and spending money, chasing that dopamine hit.... And in a way, every game I finish, I can then sell... It's a bit like being paid to play video games (at least thats what I'm telling myself!) 

Any other game collectors / ex-game collectors who've been through or are currently going through a similar situation of decluttering their collections? 

This is a really big thing for me, as I have an addictive personality so need to make sure I don't slip back into buying games for that dopamine hit, or end up replacing the addiction with something else! 

Any advice / tips would be much appreciated, thanks! üòÑ",declutter,1739745803.0

I'm going to call this experiment a success.

My biggest goal was to use up ingredients, and that worked great. Off the top of my head I finished several small portions of meat, bread and veggies from my freezer. Most of my half empty bags of rice, beans and pasta are gone. Lots of odds and ends are gone.

I threw some 3-12 month old bags of random veggies in a casserole just to see what would happen. Most of that went in the bin but it was still dinner. This was my first freestyle casserole so I can add that skill to my cooking toolkit now.

---

**What I bought:**

Week 1: The only pantry goods I bought were corn syrup and cereal to make cereal bars. The rest was meat and veggies.

Week 2: A few ingredients for sauces and a big chub of meat because it was on sale. Oops. This week had about $30 in veggies, none of which got tossed surprisingly.

**Permanent changes:**

This experiment changed how I shop for the better.

First, I started checking the pantry and freezer the day before my shopping run. This gives me plenty of time to plan out meals that use what I have on hand.

Second, I realized just how often I was buying ingredients because they looked good and not because I have plans for them.

I've mostly stopped buying staples on impulse.",declutter,1739751221.0
"Torn Between the Security of ""Just in Case"" Items and Decluttering","I need advice.

I‚Äôve read books by the notables like the Minimalists, Fumio Sasaki, Youheum Son, and Kondo, and follow well-known minimalists on YouTube and podcasts. I fully believe in the benefits of decluttering, and I want to commit. But when it comes to letting go, I hesitate. I keep extra power blocks, random screws, and dozens of pens‚Äîjust in case.

Decluttering emotionally charged items?,"As the title suggests I have been doing my best to declutter emotionally charged items lately.

Digital video/audio project decluttering,"I am very much in over my head with digital clutter and desperately need advice.

A little about me: I am 29 and I've been making random little music and video projects since I was 14. I have AuDHD and over time I have amassed a ridiculous amount of files, some organized and some not, but a large majority of them are important in some way. I have a 2Tb hard drive that has about 1.3Tb full right now - some of these files are photos, but a big chunk of them are video and audio files.

I am an artist and musician, but I also have a day job and making music is something I do as a creative hobby. Regardless, it's my passion and I am extremely attached to the things I make. Unfortunately, because I work and have limited time to do hobbies, I rarely actually finish anything I start. I also have a bad habit of recording large durations of video/audio on my phone without labeling them, leading to hundreds of hours of unlabeled digital content.

My biggest issue regarding my file collection is that I have no way to assess which files are important without sitting down and watching/listening to all of them. I write original songs, but for many of the songs I've written the only known recording I have is lost somewhere within a random unnamed video/audio files on this massive drive. Additionally, I am trans and started medically transitioning on testosterone 3 years ago, so I have recorded a ridiculous amount of videos documenting my progress as a singer. These videos and audios are very sentimental to me, but I know they are mixed in with many files that include bad takes or multiple recordings of the same thing.

This problem is also my motivation to declutter my massive collection, but it just feels impossible to actually accomplish and maintain. I know I need to be better about labeling files when I create them, but I haven't found a system that actually works that I can stick to. I've tried having ""MASTER"" file folders, but then I end up making multiple ""MASTER"" folders in different locations which defeats the purpose.

I've tried automating the process by using the Everything program, using batch file labeling software, etc. This has helped quite a bit with my photos specifically, but the videos are another issue entirely. With photos, I can open one up and instantly identify what it is and whether it's important. But with videos and audio, I feel the need to sit and listen to each one and compare it with every other version to decide which is the best recording I have of any given song.

I'm so sick and tired of not being able to find what I'm looking for when I want it. I've made amazing projects in Audacity or Shortcut that I'm really proud of, only to be unable to locate them later. I've written so many songs that have been lost in the sea of files. I have no way of easily accessing my best work; therefore, it feels like it's lost forever.

Apartment has been overrun with clutter for years,"Just a warning, this post may get lengthy. I apologize in advance and appreciate anyone who rides it out! I could use words of encouragement and maybe some helpful advice to get through this.

I'll start with a bit of my back story. Growing up my bedroom was usually quite messy. Nothing too outrageous just mostly clothes, knickknacks and maybe a handful of cups on my desk (Hey, they saved the day during the infamous box spring fire incident!).. but there was the pathway through like some sort of labyrinth, you know the drill. Path to the bed, to the desk and maybe the window area. My mom, who was usually fairly neat and tidy, would get and/or help me to do a full clean once in a while, but it would always inevitably deteriorate to the high level clutter.

Fast forward to me being 23 and not really knowing what to do with myself. I eventually opted to attend a job corps program and ended up living on campus for almost a year. Some surreal, crazy experiences during that chapter of my life.. anyway.. During that time, we did a weekly deep clean of our rooms / areas (typically 4 beds/closets per room with a bathroom attached) and were expected to keep our area fairly tidy. I excelled at this for the most part, for whatever reason. There were other students who would have to remove their mattress and dig out 100 food wrappers every week. I guess the trash aspect of clutter was never really my thing and I had less clothes than ever, so it was not all that hard of a transition to keep up with it.

Eventually I graduated after fast tracking the end of my schooling after having met my first wife and we moved in together directly after. My life devolved into chaos for several years. Oh yes there was clutter. There were a lot of things, mostly negative, I don't need to delve into. I'll just say it's easy to have zero clutter when you're homeless. We eventually separated and I made the difficult transition to being on my own in my own place for the first time ever. We had found a landlord willing to work with us, and had gotten our lives somewhat on track. But then she walked out and I was left with all the bills and rent. My car I was using to get to 2 jobs broke down on the highway so I junked it on the spot as the transmission let out and there was no way I could afford to tow it anywhere and fix it. This meant I had to leave one of the jobs that was a much further commute and the single job wasn't cutting it. Lost internet, fell behind on rent. It wasn't pretty. I was quite depressed and in a bad place because of the situation.

Then a friend I had made at job corps offered to be room mates and we found a new place together and I started turning my life back around again. I kept my room similar to how it had been in job corps, with a few slight liberties but no clutter. I used a hamper and mostly everything had its place. I was even getting into the best shape of my life. Then I met my now wife. That was almost 8 years ago. We have our differences but I love her and generally life isn't too bad.

But the clutter.. the clutter is the worst I've dealt with in my life. It's not hoarder stacks or anything, but it's taken over several big areas of our apartment. We have a dining room area attached to the kitchen we have nick named ""the abyss"" because it's where things go that we aren't currently using to be forgotten. Our bedroom is worse. Two corners are (were, we'll get to that) stacked with various random items. Clothes, cards, knickknacks, gadgets, you name it it's probably there in some form of iteration. The wall connecting said corners has our 2 dressers along it that we can't really access.. and more clutter draped over them like some sort of clutter blanket. We just have like 3 totes of all our clothes in front of the dressers that we dig through for clothing when we need. Ashamed to say a good portion of it ends up on the floor around the totes and ends up getting walked on. We have several cats so if I see a lot of hair I know it's likely a floor item due for rewashing.

So in the recent past I have tried picking at the clutter, mainly in the abyss. I have tried hacking at it and wearing it down like some boss fight that you need to pace yourself for. It just always grows back. I'll clear the table and it will be clear for a few days and then suddenly it's just covered again. I feel like I know exactly what needs to be done I just can't find the motivation for it. Until today. I have been wanting a new desk for my computer setup so I can start using a two monitor setup, but currently there wouldn't really be space for a larger desk. My desk is in a corner of the bedroom that hasn't been devoured by clutter, but the free space around it requires a shift in the furniture to accommodate a larger desk or even a new location on another wall. This is impossible with the clutter taking up basically half of the bedroom. So today I tackled a corner. It has a door near that has not been fully swung open since within a year of moving in. The floor hasn't been revealed in years. There were items from 6+ years ago. I got most of the corner cleared. A good little square of clear floor space. Three full trash bags removed and tossed.

I need encouragement because I was quite proud of this progress, but my wife didn't make a very big deal of it. I know she's been dealing with a lot, but I was hoping for a bit more of a reaction. It was a solid 2 hours of grueling decluttering. It may not seem like very much time, but it definitely doesn't help that I have pretty severe dust allergies.. and it's somewhat depressing work even though it's progress. I am going to keep tackling new spots and make sure they don't fall back until the place is under control.

I know most of the tips and ideas. Limit things being brought in unless they have a necessary purpose or use. Let go of things being kept just for the sake of being kept. I mean let's face it, if we haven't seen or thought of these things in years, they're probably not that important in the grand scheme of things. Not that it's always the case. I unearthed some of our wedding memorabilia, which obviously didn't get tossed, but a large % of what I uncovered did. Make and keep routines that involve cleaning / decluttering to make it habitual and keep it from becoming a massive daunting task. Make homes for things and stick to keeping things ""home."" I get at my wife about this. In all our years here I have misplaced my wallet perhaps once, and I don't even recall specifically, because I always keep it in the same spot in our bedroom. Her on the other hand, not to put her down but she has lost hers more than I can remember. It could be in any of a dozen locations, or somewhere else entirely for whatever reason. She just gets upset whenever I bring up that she should have a dedicated spot for it. Any advice on this would be appreciated.

I am focused and motivated to get it under control and I know it will be hours upon hours of work to get there. I plan on doing a few per day here and there until it's done.. at the same time it is hard to keep it from growing back while I am not keeping at it. I guess because my approach has often been to organize and move around the clutter, rather than actually taking care of it. Sweeping it under the rug, so to speak. But I intend to actually get rid of a large portion of it now, and find means of organizing and homing the rest.

I apologize again for the massive wall of text, but I felt the need for some sort of outlet and this community has seemed to be very empathetic and helpful from what I've browsed and seen recently. Hoping to eventually see some light at the end of this tunnel.",declutter,1740113330.0

Friday 15: Outerwear!,"Take a look at coats, snow boots, gloves, hats, and similar -- items you only wear for going out of the house. It's time to say goodbye to:

* Boots that are meant to be waterproof but in fact leak.
* Gloves and mittens with holes.
* The coat that you already bought a replacement for, so you always wear the replacement.
* The coat you avoid in favor of wearing layers of sweaters.
* The coat you haven't worn in years and wouldn't bother digging out if the occasion for it happened.
* The winter hat that makes your head itch.
* The summer hat that annoys you past bearing every time you wear it.
* Anything else that doesn't fit (and won't any time soon), is damaged, doesn't do what it's supposed to do, or fills you with loathing.

Things in reasonably good shape can be donated. Non-functional items like leaky boots need to be thrown out. What goes back in your coat closet should be items you will gladly wear when the occasion for them arises -- and the occasion should be fairly likely.

I kept maybe 10 items that were special to me, some was stuff that my mom had also worn when she was young (but I gave away most of that, too) as well as a couple miscellaneous things that had a special memory attached to them. I also kept my old cowhide backpack and a suede pair of boots.

"Taking my first leap into proper decluttering, any advice to share?","Well, hello there everyone. I do hope anyone reading this is doing well in their lives and living spaces. Courtesy out of the way, I suppose I'll get to the bulk of it all, forgive me in advance for the written clutter.

I live in a pretty compact 2 bedroom apartment, with anywhere from 3 to 5 bodies sleeping here at a time. In my thirties after a decade of time adopting some family into my care for their sake. (And eventually my own, after I realized the good it did for me.)

I believe I keep myself fairly organized, but I am also damned with my mother's clutter and hoarding bug, as well as have an aversion to simply throwing away what can better serve it's purpose in someone else's hands. I have myself far more coordinated, and even recently picked up a few nice wooden bowls secondhand that I use for dropzones of my daily clutter, except that's doing nothing to help me with the cheap plastic drawers I still have in the house, holding the amalgamations of spare tech, soldering, household, writing... uhh... Crochet needles... bike tubes... lightbulbs...A label printer.  
  
I'm sure anyone reading can tell I was looking through the plastic and eyeballing stuff without a dedicated home. I did have some success using heavy duty ziplocks to sort of bundle things together, like everything to do from glue/tape to command strips and zipties all in one big bag I can get to. I have sorted these bags into large bins each labeled in a generalized sense. ""Tools I use very infrequently goes in the tools box"" kinda deal. But I find myself shuffling them around, pulling the bag out, putting it to use, and then in the assumption that I'll need it or something out of those bags, they find their way into the clutter drawers again. So I am attempting to add some midway storage like open topped cheap plastic basket bin things I can store out of sight, but can still access or shuffle items into and out of.

Then the matter of my small kitchen, my cabinets are tiny, terribly sized for things like lazy susans and stuff like that in terms of my little spice cabinet, and I have 4 drawers all above each other that are only 8"" across. Not a lot of workable space when I'm cooking meals to serve a household, or when I make bulk meals to setup in the freezer for anyone to grab and cook in a hurry. I also have a moderate stockpile of cans setup on a wire rack to keep from making a compact dust and bug space in these worn out cabinets, I'm tempted to find some vertical stacking solutions, but most look like they would just take more space to turn the cans sideways on a fancy rack, while already being on a rack, so I have resorted to stacking them in scary ways and picking them off the floor at least once or twice a month.

Appliances, I've got 2 sizes of snow cooker, one was a gift, a small rice cooker, a quality blender, one of those cheep griddles I can probably do without now that I think about it, a big turkey cooker that I often keep in storage until the holidays or cooking for a family thing that never happens, a combo microwave/convection oven, and a dinky little toaster. the common use cases shelved under my microwave in it's own spot, and the uncommon ones stored away pretty well.

Under my sinks I keep cleaning stuff to a minimum, and keep them in their own bins, one with niche body hygiene and dog grooming needs.

And my tiny linen closets have a reduced amount of blankets, bed sheets and stuff, a bunch of white rags dedicated for cleaning, and colored rags for anything body related. I did have a lot of the extra bedding in vacuum bags, but in the midst of it all, the blankets and bags are still in the closet, just separate, for whatever reason.

I will admit, I've got a lot of stuff, and I draw the line between stuff and needs as plainly as I can. I can't say the same for everyone else here, as we each have our own clutter, and I find myself spending the energy tending to theirs, as the guardian and head of household, can't get teenagers to keep their desks clean no matter how expensive the computer they have sitting on it, and I can't really force them to respect the efforts to keep things tidy when my systems aren't readily accommodating for them to follow with less effort. They need a blanket out of the vacuum seal bag, but don't want to get the vacuum out of the closet 15 feet away to re-seal it, and just end up squirrel packing the lightly squeezed bag into the closet, kinda deal.

So to try and summarize. I'm just one guy here trying to accommodate for the kids I've raised into young adults, while setting an example on how to do it. As well as trying to keep myself orderly. I'm too empathetic and too broke to just be throwing things away, and I do have a habit of buying things I often don't need until I absolutely do. So far I'm trying to get myself into a system of storage that respects the need for something, and how readily I should have it available, while trying to readily store and remove things left unused.

If you got this far and have any advice, I would readily appreciate it.",declutter,1740166549.0
New habits that have helped you be less cluttered,"What habits or steps have you implemented in your life after a major declutter sesh?

Big project ahead...I could use a pep talk,"I'm about to fly to another city where I have been paying for a storage unit...

I did the math. It's horrific. Let's not talk about that anymore.

I think the last time I was there and cracked the door on the unit was to take out one or two things and then hastily throw some other stuff in and skip town again. Now I'm going back solely for the purpose of dealing with this horrendous situation. I've given myself three full days to deal with it‚Äîthat's all the time I can take but I think it should be enough. It's only a 5x5 but it's VERY full, and stacked very high, as I recall.

And I know in the process of sifting through to find the few things I can remember that are in there that I want, it's going to be a freaking nightmare making myself throw everything else out (but I must. I am flying in and can only take so much back with me.) There are highly sentimental items from parents who have passed, childhood yearbooks, that kind of stuff. And mountains and mountains of crap.

Because I know I will get weak in the moment because in addition to the few must-rescues there is also going to be all manner of little childhood things, a ton of level-three sentimentality stuff that is going to be super tough to resist, I'm making a list of all the good questions to ask when deciding when to get rid of something, and all the great little maxims to help motivate me as I go.

Six bins of stuff off to a new home,"This week I was able to give away 5 storage bins worth of clothes my son has grown out of, and a bin of maternity clothes. Even though I know that I'm done having kids, I think I was holding onto these things for emotional reasons.

Ugh... ironically thinking about declutterimg tea when I'm sick.,"Except I can't actually taste it properly (or trust myself to anyway) to tell what I want to keep and what's fine to donate.

Still got the ""keepers"" that are either on the verge of expiring or accidental duplicates I can work on, but how do I declutter food I _haven't_ tried yet under the circumstances?

Edit to add: cold, not covid. So nothing long-term thank goodness. But still affects how things taste.....

Edit also to clarify: The reason I say it's ironic in the title is that I'm looking at drinking the tea as a _good_ thing when I'm sick, ie certain types are better for your immune system... or at least relieving symptoms, making it a question of which tea to drink. Which leads me to the decluttering side of things, in which my serial procrastinator self is basically thinking ""This could be the perfect kick in the pants to go through the ones I haven't tried yet... oh wait dammit. üòÖ""",declutter,1740346689.0

what to do with deceased artist's art,"Edit: Thank you all for your advice. I've read all the comments, I'm sorry I couldn't respond to everyone. 


My MIL passed away and we're clearing out her house. Estate sale is schedule for end of April. She was an artist who focused on quantity and didn't sell much. Over 1K pieces combined of pottery and 2D art. 

What are we going to do with what is left over? We've all taken what we want. There might be a few pieces more, here and there,, but for the most part, we're done picking out what we want (which amounts of about .1% percent of her belongings)

Because I'm a fellow artist, and because I took charge on clearing out her studio (with numerous friends' help), I'm stressed that I'm going to get saddled with doing something with all the art. I want to throw it all in the dumpster, I'm so pissed right now. I don't want to spends 100s more hours photographing her artwork and turning it into a book, as a friend of theirs suggested. I don't want to find places to sell. I want to be 100% done with dealing with her belongings when the house goes on the market. I'm tired of being responsible for anything regarding my MIL. 

How do I politely tell the family ""No"", that I'm not taking this on, and it's time for me to be done. None of them want the art either, and none of them want her stuff in their home (they are insanely picky and extremely minimalist). Maybe I just shouldn't say anything, and if they ask, I politely say no, I'm not the best person for the job? I don't know how to photograph artwork, and I just don't have the cycles for this. I'm burned out.

How to declutter when you know you will some day move in a bigger place ?,"Hello,

I currently live in an apartment (645 sq ft). I will move out once my partner has finished his studies. We want to buy a house one day or at least live in a bigger space. 

I've been decluttering my apartment for a year and a half and have done most of the work. I store things in boxes in my cellar that i haven't used since living in an apartment but i still have that idea it will be useful once we have a bigger living space (notably anything for an outside space, which i used to have before my partner went back to school and we moved closer to his college). But that's only speculation since i have no idea what kind of place we'll live in and if I'll really want to use those things.

My question is for people in my case or who have lived it : how do you differentiate between clutter and ""futur useful objects""? I find it difficult to judge and really look into the future like that.

Thanks !",declutter,1740418871.0

I can see my floor!! (10 years in the making),"For the first time in the 10 years I‚Äôve lived in this apartment when my family had to downsize there Is a clear pathway around my room and NO OBSTACLES AND PILES. I started with not being able to see my floor to stuff thrown in boxes and stacked, to smaller piles being formed, and now I see the light at the end of the tunnel. I just have a couple bags of stuff that need to go and then my floor will finally be clear and not used as storage. I used to fight so much as a teen about wanting a bigger space to accommodate all my things but I think about how I want to live a more nomadic lifestyle/move out and having all these things wasn‚Äôt conducive to that goal. I‚Äôve been reading and re reading Marie Kondos book and I finally tapped into the sentimental part of my brain and got over the emotional aspect of decluttering. I also got serious and accepted the fact I really need to downsize for the amount of space I have and went from a queen to a double and now a twin which opened up so much floor space that was being unused and I got rid of furniture that was a bit too bulky and originally for a bigger room. 

of course I‚Äôm not finished yet, I still have to organize my shelves and closet. theres still bags of clothes that need to be sold/donated and I know I can declutter even more stuff in this room but it feels so good to finally be able to enjoy my room. I should have done this even 5 years ago but I wasn‚Äôt ready for it. yes I‚Äôm an adult that lives with their parents. Im trying to change that and I think I just took the first step to make that process easier for me. 

some things I think really helped was first to STOP SHOPPING. I have a stash of many different things that i now have to use up (my environmental science degree is really not helping the guilt) which I feel a sort of obligation to make sure most of it doesn‚Äôt end up in the landfill. I do throw things out but I also do heavily use my local buy nothing page, try to sell things, and make sure my things go somewhere it‚Äôll have a chance at a second life. I did the emotional work and realized I was using shopping as a bandaid for a myriad of issues. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I still love shopping but finding the root cause of impulsive shopping really curbed me bringing a lot of junk and knickknacks back with me. 

I don‚Äôt buy souvenirs unless I know it can serve a dual purpose (aka it‚Äôs something I needed but now it‚Äôs in a cool design) or clothes shopping (unless I really need an item). I recently took a trip with a friend and I took only 1 checked luggage. I did purchase a few things but I brought clothes to wear and took advantage of the laundry room in the hotel. When I came back all the things reintegrated with all my other things smoothly whereas before I had shipped things back which the postage probably cost more than what the actual items I sent back were even worth and things lived in boxes and on the floor before I either decluttered them or I crammed them somewhere. 

The next steps I‚Äôll take is to deal with the insane amount of hobby stuff I have as well as clothes. I love clothes but I would love to have a more capsule like wardrobe. I‚Äôd like to see the floor of my closet, I don‚Äôt particularly love having a storage tote with extra clothing. ",declutter,1740486505.0

Making progress with my parents' cluttered house,"My parents moved to an apartment near me, so their cluttered and under-maintained house is now empty of people but still full of stuff. I've started the long decluttering process, but it will take ages because I don't live nearby. Yesterday, I hired people from task rabbit remotely to clean out the basement, which is now empty, which is wonderful.

My to-do list with their house that goes like this:

1. Fix anything that comes up, which is so far: gutters, trees, toilet internal parts, pipe under kitchen sink. Pest control came because the neighbors had mice but didn't find anything, thankfully.
2. Check structure is sound and fix any structural issues. Update the lead water service line. (Update: I already have the structural engineer's plans ready to go and the basement is completely empty, so full foundation is visible and repair could start tomorrow in theory.)
3. Declutter house in reverse order of how often the rooms were used: less used rooms means nearly everything can be thrown out without sorting.
4. Update electricity, install air conditioning, update kitchen and bathrooms.

I'm starting to doubt the order of 2 and 3. There is a literal ton or two of extra weight in the house, and it seems like it might make a difference to the structural repairs, although it's pretty clear that the wood supports have had enough. Should I stick with this plan or try to get rid of more dead weight before the contractors do this major construction on the house's foundation?

Update 2: I spoke with the structural engineer and decided not to do the expensive foundation repair at this point. The main repair is replacing 120 year old wooden beams with steel, which is probably more necessary due to the large numbers of books and my father's huge amount of paper files, but probably had to be done anyhow. We'll clean up the brick foundation from inside the basement. The more extensive foundation repair involves digging a trench around the whole house in order to waterproof the outside of the house, something they couldn't do 120 years ago when the foundation was first built, but that is more costly and disruptive than I can manage. He's adjusting the plan to leave open the option of the major repair at a later point. He didn't mention the clutter as an obstacle. At some later point when the upper floors are clear, it's possible there would need to be structural work upstairs if I want to change the layout, but that basement beam is the most important structural feature.",declutter,1740498709.0
I need help ‚Äî my room is out of control,"I have endless piles of dirty clothes everywhere. My sheets haven‚Äôt been cleaned in at least two months.

Need permission to donate clothes I‚Äôve never worn but cost a fortune,"I‚Äôve recently come to terms with the fact that I have a shopping addiction. I‚Äôm currently working with a therapist and have been focusing on getting items out of the house and not replacing them for the more minimalist home I aspire to. I‚Äôve managed to donate half my kitchen, boxes of children‚Äôs toys and clothing, even books when I know they are going to a good cause. And even though my wardrobe is half of what it used to be, this is where I stumble. I have SO MANY dresses, shoes, bags, jackets. So many never worn, usually bought online and one of my lovely experiences with adhd means I am terrible at returning items in the correct window of time. The reasons I don‚Äôt wear them vary, from being the wrong size, to being a material I dislike, to feeling it‚Äôs just not ‚Äúme‚Äù in style. 

I am at the point where I NEED to get them out of my house as every day when I walk into my closet I just feel overwhelming guilt as I stare at the items while I‚Äôm getting dressed. I understand about sunk costs, I cognitively know I should just bundle it all up and donate it, but emotionally I‚Äôm struggling; with guilt over the money spent that in hindsight should have gone to different things, the idea that my envisioned self who can fit into the too small dresses will unlikely return, the sadness that I use shopping as an escape mechanism and a dopamine release.

Final Declutter done at this house,"We finally got the green light to move, and today was the final day to get trash into the garbage before we moved, so I decluttered the pantry. We have been trying to eat it down, but still had a lot of stuff. And 3 kitchen garbage bags of things that no longer tasted good, or were just plain expired. Hoping a better system for the next house!

So that was my final declutter. The rest of this stuff goes with us. I am so glad I took the time to declutter on this end!

We are downsizing to a house that is 20% smaller and a yard that is 65% smaller.  Household stuff, we made it to about 35% and yard stuff, we made it to about 95%!  

So no more excuses.  No need to ask for motivation. You just go through every item, and save, toss or donate.  It's not that compicated and if I can do it at 60 with psoriatic arthritis, you can do it as well.",declutter,1740587779.0
Tips for decluttering when your ADHD wants to see everything,"My ADHD wants to SEE EVERYTHING to help me remember it. 

For example: 

*By the front door/in the foyer:*

Hats & coats on hooks

Open shoe storage

A bin of semi-frequently used items


Several areas in our house are like that. 

Do the things need to be visible year-round, collecting dust? Probably not. But tucking them away / out of sight just causes me and others in my household to forget about them (which sucks when we actually need them, but don‚Äôt think of it because they are out of sight).

I'm 19 trying to get my own place, but until I do I need to survive living with my mom.

Okay so for context/rant: My parents moved far from my school, so I had to live with my grandparents for 4 years. When I turned 18 my dad divorced mom and I was still living with my grandparents. All of my things have been scattered across my family, I've been trying to bring all if it back to one place for 2 years. Some of it was in storage, but my dad waited to long to pay the bill. Stuff from storage spread from my grandparents garage to my dad's work warehouse, and all over the place again. For 3 years alot of my ameadit things like clothes and prized possessions where scattered between my mom's place, and my grandparents place. At my grandparents place I've been using the guest room that had been used as a extra storage room,  so most of my stuff has nowhere to go in there. At my mom's place I have my own room that has only my thing's in it, so I've been trying to move everything into there. 
HERE IS WHERE IT GETS COMPLICATED- my mom requires me to have a license, and car to live with her (I've been fixing up my dad's old car that will be mine, and I'll be getting my license soon) ,but she also recently added that it can't look like a horders place. Probably because my grandparents are horders and lots of drama between them, it doesn't help that it's my dad's grandparents so they have issues, aswell as they are horrid people to begin with. I understand not wanting the house to look like a horders place, but it's a downsize to what we had 4 years ago. I'm 19 and getting a job, so I can find my own place (because noone in my family is good to live with) and I can't do that with my grandparents since they are more toxic than my mom. Living with her will help me be closer to jobs and she will actually Want me to get a job and get out. She fears that I will make it a horders situation, even though I told her several times it won't, I'll keep it clean, and that everything that's mine will stay in my room always until I get my own place. She wouldn't care if all my stuff stays in my room though because if it's apart of our small apartment, and if she can see it, she will be upset. Now here is my problem here, I love my stuff, and I like to decorate like a maximalist or like a jungle vibe with my plants and everything witch core, dnd, anime, gaming, books, Manga, stuffed animals, shiny things that I collect! all the awsome hobbies I have! making my room the Escape and safe space I want! That's the issue though, I have to find a way to make everything turn into a minimalist type view at least a way to make it seem like it at least but idk where to look or start reddit please help me, I'm just trying to make with what I got, then move out as soon as I can.

Shifting my mindset: our house is enough,"I've been on a massive declutter after basically having a meltdown in January. I was so ashamed of my house and how I could never have anyone over. When I was a kid, I was always so upset that we couldn't have people over because of living in a hoarder house. And then found myself in basically the same situation--my house was too cluttered, which made it really, really hard to actually clean, and then I was too ashamed to have people over. Someone told me in one of my mom groups that my kids deserved better. And that hit hard. They were right!

My husband and I kept saying, ""We need to move! We don't have enough room for all of this stuff!"" One day, though, I said, ""Families make it work in tiny apartments and we have a 3 bedroom house. We should be able to make this work.""

I got rid of serving stuff since we haven't hosted much now that I have 2 toddlers.

I got rid of 12 wine glasses; my husband and I don't drink. I still have 8 that need to go.

I got rid of SEVENTY toys/sets of toys.

I got rid of all the hand-me-downs my siblings forced on me that I would have to store for a decade before it would be useful for my kids.

I got rid of all the cleaning supplies I keep around because I spent money on them and always tell myself I NEED to use them (but I never did).

I got rid of the stupid amount of stained throw pillows in my living room. Toddlers and throw pillows aren't a great mix.

I got rid of the brand new, unopened carpet cleaner we've had sitting in my husband's office for 5 years (we don't have carpet anymore).

* Clean it out. If it's in poor condition, switch to a back-up and get rid of this bag.
* Put back the things you actively use and need, neatly.

**For bags and packs as a whole, say goodbye to:**

* The bag that always does something incredibly annoying (falls open, falls off your shoulder, straps too short, pockets the wrong size). Quiet meditation on the closet shelf will not heal it.
* The bag in poor condition that you've already bought a back-up for.
* The everyday bag that you haven't used in over a year.
* The bag that's a great color, brand, style, whatever, but you always put it back because it doesn't quite work with your outfit or life.
* The bag that's a ""just in case we ever..."" but the last time we did, you reached for something else and did fine.

Advice for Decluttering & Organizing During A Move!,"My husband & I currently live in a small 1BR apartment (~700SF) and in a few months will be moving to a new unit in our complex of the same size. We have too much stuff for our small space, and a small rented storage closet in our building that I‚Äôd love to stop paying for. Past rounds of decluttering one area at a time haven‚Äôt cut it. We will have a two week overlap with both apartments and I‚Äôm eager to use the time to really cut down on our stuff and get organized from the get-go in our new space.

I‚Äôd love any advice or strategies to tackle the process! Creative storage ideas for small spaces to stay organized are also welcomed!

Other context if it‚Äôs helpful: part of our problem is that we have pockets of things in different spaces, so it‚Äôs not as noticeable if we have duplicates. We also both have hobbies that accumulate objects (art, sewing, music, etc.). 

Thanks in advance :)",declutter,1740754502.0
"Am I hoarding, or am I being reasonable?","Hello Everyone,

I have a ton of hobbies and two of them are repairing/ modifying electronics, making custom audio, and electronic cables, and sewing.  What's great is I'm able to reuse a lot of things that are broken and I can save money, but on the other hand I accumulate a lot of ""spare parts"" instead of tossing things.

For example, I like making bags and backpacks, so if I have an old bag I deconstruct it to individual parts and save the zippers, pulls, handles, lining and buckles. Same with electronics, if something breaks I usually desolder and save the batteries, wires, cables, etc.. 

Some of the individual parts can be expensive like YKK zipper pulls, cordura fabric, stretch lining. But I'm getting in my head about how I'm just hoarding all these things instead of throwing them away. 

A lot of decluttering has to do with ""closing your eyes"" and throwing things that could be replaceable, but I feel like it's a waste when I can save parts for different uses.

Update: Lots of great advice here and some that I've used in the past for organization like the ""Container Method"" mentioned here. 

I have 1 drawer for soldering tools, ppe, extra components and I've organized them by type in divided bins. Additionally, I have 1 large bin in my garage with extra computer parts. 

For sewing, fabrics,  and all extra parts are stored in a 19L waterproof bin I store underneath my sewing machine with threads + equipment in smaller bins in a cabinet. With 1 extra sewing machine in my garage. 

I'm still going through some introspection of what to toss and what to keep, but I did throw away all my bread boards that I've never used and I'll probably toss colored thread I'll never use either.  It's progress, but I feel like this may be a ""look inside myself"" moment",declutter,1740772929.0
I need ideas for a 7' by 7' kitchenette.,"I live in a small one bedroom apartment with a tiny 7 foot by 7 foot 'kitchen' that has full sized fridge and stove, a double sink, and small cupboards. I guess I'm lucky that at one end, I have a window.

I also love to cook, and have a variety of pots and pans.  I have pared down to one of each type. I have enough dishes for two. I used ikea rails on three walls to hang pots and pans.  I have two appliances on the counter - airfryer, which I use at least 3x a week, and a cheap espresso machine.  I also have a shelf unit outside the kitchen for other appliances and pantry stapes - flour, rice, salt, pasta.  My microwave is on top of the fridge. I use a Kallax 2X2 in the dining room as a sideboard, and it holds a lot.  I also have a narrow portable dishwasher that acts as my main countertop, as the others flank the stove and sink.

But no matter what I do, it gets cluttered immediately.  It drives me MAD.  I have ADHD and compensate as best I can but it makes me crazy.  Do you have any ideas outside the box to help me battle the daily clutter?  One side of the sink has a drying rack and once a day I do wash any dishes that accumulate.

I would appreciate ideas.  Thank you!",declutter,1740773754.0
Success story: junk journalling with papers collected from travel,"I love to travel, and I often bring home brochures, receipts, tickets, etc. as souvenirs. But my collection had been getting out of hand, making it hard to go through when I wanted to reminisce. So when someone I follow on YouTube (Sojournies) posted a video about their travel junk journal, I thought it was such a neat idea. 

One week, one journal, most of a glue stick, and a whole lot of washi tape later, I was successfully able to contain my collection and present it beautifully. I cut out parts of brochures I wanted to display or use as backdrops, recycling what I didn't use, and laying out everything flat on the journal pages made the resulting stack more compact. I store my journal in the same box that I kept the paper collection, and there's much more room in there now.

And it was such a fun, creative project. With the brochures and other handouts beautifully designed by professionals, the pages look really nice without a ton of effort. Really proud of what I made!",declutter,1740805125.0

Putting photos into digitally made photo book (such as Snapfish)?,"I plan to digitize some photos but want to keep some in the physical world that I can look through.

March challenge: Paperwork and e-paperwork!,"It's the most dreaded time of the year! Time to sort paperwork, whether physical or online.

Before getting started, do three things:

* Check your country's rules for how long financial documents like tax returns need to be kept.
* Set aside a spot (box, tray, email folder) for documents you need for filing taxes.
* Set aside a spot (box, tray, email folder) for documents you need to deal with ASAP.

Your goal is to keep only:

* Documents you actually need for real financial, legal, and health purposes. 
* Documents that require action soon (payments needed, checks to deposit, receipts for returns. etc.).
* Manuals for things you actually own, if you prefer paper manuals.
* Meaningful sentimental items like letters or cards, which are kept *separately,* in a keepsake box.

How you store useful documents is up to you. Many people like scanning. Many people like to go paperless for bills and set up auto-payments. The important thing is that you can find your long-term needed documents, and you can act on your short-term action items.

Can somebody help me with a declutter decision,"I have two kids. One 6 months old one 4yo.I have an entire spare room filled baby stuff that is no longer being used. Cots, clothes, you name it. We don't know for sure that we won't have more kids. We don't THINK we will. But it's possible. I am so far keeping this stuff as 'just in case'.

"How much is your time, energy, mental health worth?","TL;DR: When thinking about how much an item is worth - how much you spent for it, how much your could sell it for resale, how much you would be saving just in case you needed it and didn't have to re-buy it - please consider putting a value on how much your time, energy, and mental health are worth.  Because unless something is really expensive, you may be ""spending"" more to sell it (or keep it) than the item cost in the first place.

I had an epiphany the other day when faced with a closet-full of stuff I thought I wanted to sell on eBay.  This represented the last of my vintage sewing collecting phase (insanity), and the remnants of my non-functional sewing room/guest room/Hell Room. It was all packed up in boxes, ready to list but I've been procrastinating doing anything for probably 2-3 years.  Why did I want to sell it when I so obviously did NOT want to sell it?  So here goes:

There's this intrinsic value (money) we put on things - easy, that's usually the price we paid to acquire it or how much something is going for on eBay.  But what happens when we decide we don't want that thing anymore?  It's not serving us anymore, we don't really like it or care about it anymore, buying it was a mistake, etc?  Some of us can just get rid of it and move on.  But money is tight and the future is so uncertain right now!  Maybe we hope to recoup some (or all) of that money through selling.  Maybe we decide to hold onto the item ""just in case.""  Why re-buy something when you need it if you already have it?  You're saving money in the long run by not wasting it now, right?

But when we take into consideration the time that stuff represents - either the selling or the additional storage/maintenance responsibilities, how much is that stuff really worth?   Some of us already have a value we put on our time - how much are we ""worth"" per hour, usually based on our employment compensation expectations.  But women are especially bad at putting a value on their time and young people who haven't really had a decent job - what is your time value worth to you?  

Maybe you like selling, maybe it feels value-added .  If that's the case, great!  People DIY all the time.  And eBay, Poshmark, The Real Real, etc wouldn't be what they are if people weren't willing to engage in resale.

But if you take the what you can reasonably expect to get for an item second-hand (minus any selling fees) minus your time value and compare that figure to the original price you paid for your unwanted item, unless what you're trying to sell is pretty darn expensive, you may actually be ""spending"" more than the item is worth to just donate.

Ditto for keeping stuff ""just in case"" - are you leaking time?  How much shuffling are you doing in your (limited) storage areas to make it all fit?  Make it functional?  Make it manageable?  Make it memorable?  How much extra time does it take to find what you're looking for because of all the extra not-going-to-be-looking-for-it-anytime-soon stuff?  How much does this extra stuff translate into additional housework/household maintenance expectations/responsibilities?  How much aggravation is it contributing to your daily tasks?  Are we ""wasting"" time like a leaky window wastes our heating bill?

To me, you can usually get more money (or at the very least, not spend more money) but you cannot get more time - time gets ""spent"" whether we want to or not.  How we spend it, that's what matters.  Playing with your kid, learning Spanish, going to the gym, reading a book, binge-watching a show, taking a nap.  I think all of those things are a better way to spend our limited (and we don't even know HOW limited) time than trying to figure out why I should keep something, where should I put it, how I can squeeze every nickel out of it, generally fussing around with our stuff.

And how many of us actually put a cash value on our energy or our mental health?  Depending on your situation (kids, school, stressful job, financial worries, extra responsibilities/obligations, etc) your available energy reserves might be pretty limited/easily depleted.   And if you're feeling overwhelmed for any reason, your mental bandwidth might be pretty limited, too.  Like your precious time, how do you want to spend your limited energy?

Pride of ownership is real.  It is very satisfying to be in a space, tastefully decorated, surrounded by all of your favorite things.  And it is very comforting to know that you have the things you need AND the available space to do the things you want to do.  But if you feel like you are literally drowning in stuff - if your stuff is stressing you out, causing you to feel anxious or nervous, maybe even making you feel stupid or wasteful or ungrateful or a failure - how is that stuff serving you?  Is it improving you life or sucking up your vitality like a psychic vacuum?

If having extra stuff ""just in case"" actually makes you feel safer, secure, confident then go ahead and feather your nest.  

But if it's just more stuff cluttering up your mental inventory, more stuff added to your to-do list, more stuff leaching your time, energy, peace of mind - if you literally do not have the bandwidth to deal with unnecessary things (physical, electronic, scheduling, relationships), think about how much that stuff is costing you - not necessarily the cost of the item or what we could possibly recoup from the item, but the limited time, energy, executive function we expend dealing with that item.  

And consider letting it go.  Pack it up for donation, put it in the trash/recycling.  Stuff is trivial, time (and energy) is precious.

Hope that mindset shift helps someone as much as it helped me.",declutter,1740856219.0
Bags and bags of rags,"I keep clean, worn-out/torn/stained cotton T-shirts, underwear, and socks to use as cleaning rags, in plastic bags under the kitchen sink. Today we had a minor flood in the kitchen and by the washing machine, and some of the rags got wet. Investigation revealed a ridiculous quantity of socks, undies, pieces of pillowcase, small squares from sweatpants and shirts. So--after several hours of fretting--I threw out a big bag of small, useless, or crunchy rags. What we have left (still plenty) now fit in the shelf allotted to them. I think 15 old socks and about the same number of undies will be enough to meet normal needs. We also still have a pile of t-shirts and big old towels for cat beds, cleaning up big puddles, etc. 

Does anyone else feel compelled to save all the rags for cleaning the house? (Or the garage, or the windshields, or mirrors, or Mom's old silverware, or, or ?) Why was it so hard to discard some of them? We still have plenty.

Wake up it's the first of the month!! February reflections and March planning,"In February I finished the Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning and got rid of 100 (plus or minus) items! 

I felt pretty indifferent to the book, I know a lot of people like it which I can see why but I don't think I'm necessarily the target audience. I'm still in my early 20s and have yet to face my mortality lol but I think this will be a really good book for my parents.  I felt it was very memoir like with some good tidbits about decluttering. However, I did take away a few things that I will keep in mind/utilize. It felt like she lived quite a rich and storied life with lots of opportunities to obtain trinkets and lots of cool items that are hard to part with. She grew up with a second home in the countryside and sounds like she has a decently large family. But I think she has slowly minimized down to an apartment which I think is quite normal for a lot of seniors that I know around me as well. 

  
I also kept a running tally for the month to kind of motivate me and to keep track of what left my home. It wasn't really comprehensive I'm sure I've missed logging stuff and also a lot of small trinkets that don't take up a lot of space left. But I think they all count. One thing I've realized in February is if I don't touch something I could really consider getting rid of something. It's such a simple concept but it's so hard to implement. I was able to declutter a lot of nail polish this way. Sometimes I get really overwhelmed by options and keeping it simple helps a lot. I also threw away some ephemera of pamphlets and tour info when I went on vacation. I kept 1 thing from that pile- it was from pre COVID and of a simpler time but the information like tours and hours are outdated and I can never return back to that time. So off it went. I grieve that time period but it made so much room in my drawer. 

  
Another update to my no shopping. I know I've purchased a lot of random stuff like crafting things over the years so it's been fun to dig them back up and use them again. Another thing is that I've been cooking more at home and while the urge to buy new kitchenware is strong, I know we have everything I need. Especially cute little containers for my stuff. My parents already have a huge stash. So while everything is not new and aesthetic, we have it at home!! And I'm putting it to use. 

  
In March, I'd like to declutter another 100 items. I have a few random paper folders and drawers that I need to go through as well as the clothes and crafting stuff that I think will make me reach my goal easily. Honestly I'm thinking if these clothes I've listed for resell don't sell by the end of the month I will just donate them. I also haven't been leaving the house. I used to be out and about all the time and it would cause me to spend money. There's always something to buy! It kind of feels a little stifling to not have a place to leave to but I think I will enjoy this time and create something instead. I also plan to make a personal ""box"" like Magnusson has that instructs a family member to just chuck it just in case. I'm using my time to work out to fit into my clothes better again so I also don't have to buy new stuff. 

  
Anyways this is just a kind of brain dump, I'm really proud of myself for getting to this point and mostly emotionally detach myself. Here's to a more decluttered March! And NO SHOPPING FOR ME. ",declutter,1740890115.0

Digital decluttering tips:,"Here are a bunch of digital decluttering tips that are useful but not worthy of their own post. 

* WizTree can highlight the large files and folders on Windows. Go through and purge the worst offenders.

* In Google Drive, tap the ""Storage (X% full)"" bar then ""clean up space."" Google will recommend large files to delete. Google Takeout can download the entire Drive folder at once if you want to move stuff off the cloud. 

* Deciding that you don't actually plan to do a task is a valid reason to check something off your to-do list.

* Next time you're doomscrolling, scroll through old photos instead. Delete any that you don't want to keep.

* Digital storage is cheap and don't take up any physical space. Offloading files from your main device onto a backup drive is fine.

* Create a folder called ""Junk to delete later."" Whenever you make a file that you only need briefly (like downloading something to print), put it there. Purge the folder every once and a while.

* Purge your downloads folder occasionally.

* If you switch to a new notes app, take a moment to transfer only the notes that you may reference in the future. Delete the others.

* Scroll through your YouTube/social media following list and get rid of creators you are no longer interested in. This will also improve your recommendations a little.

* If you get a lot of emails from one address (marketing emails, USPS informed delivery, social notifications), you can delete/archive them all at once by typing the address into the Gmail search bar.

* Turn off notifications for most of your apps. You can open social media apps in your own time. Notifications that you want to see but aren't time sensitive can be set to silent. 

* Android temporarily disables apps you haven't used in months (Settings > Apps > Unused apps). You can probably delete all of them.

* Create a separate email account for websites that you know will send a lot of spam. Don't bother checking this one regularly.

* Use a password manager like Bitwarden to keep your passwords organized. Paprika can keep recipes organized. There are AI tools to tag and organize photos.

* Here are some places people often forgot to declutter: Desktop, downloads folder, old apps/programs, games (especially from launchers other than Steam), subscriptions, legacy media.",declutter,1740948722.0

"Goodbye, Things by Fumio Sasaki","Dear Fellow Declutter-er,

I hope that you try to look into reading this book (Goodbye, Things by Fumio Sasaki) to jumpstart your decluttering adventures.  
Obviously, don‚Äôt buy the book but borrow it from the library or use an app you see fit (e.g Hoopla, Libby, etc).  
This book gave me a lot of positive perspective on the impact of not having so much stuff or accumulating things. I have more fire to keep going.  While there may be some extreme examples of minimalism in this book, you must take what you want or pick and choose the best advice.  Some of Fumio‚Äôs advice might not even be attainable (e.g. not making coffee daily but instead going to a cafe).  

Some tidbits:
-Your stuff is like a roommate but you pay for their rent to be there.  
-You don‚Äôt need to stock up on stuff, the stores do that for you. 
-It‚Äôs okay if you spent a lot of money and haven‚Äôt used the item.  You‚Äôre probably not going to use it at all.  
-Your silent to-do list is effecting your mental health.  Things are ‚Äúspeaking‚Äù to you.  For example, those pants you bought that need to be hemmed‚Ä¶ either donate it or hem them!

Don't declutter your sentimental items curate them instead,"My mother painted dozens of ceramic houses.

Likewise, when looking at my travel scrapbooks (I'm old-school here, back before smart phones when we took disposable cameras with us on our trips lol), I don't have to keep every picture of places I visited twenty years ago.  I can curate my photos and by doing so declutter by combining my scrapbooks.

Need Advice on Decluttering My Wardrobe,"About a month ago, I decided to simplify my wardrobe drastically. Here‚Äôs my current setup. I have 5 sets of clothes ( what I wear at home, to work, and my underwear) stored in a bin on my bedroom floor. Everything else is in my closet, though there are a few extra items that I can still use.

I know I need to declutter, but I'm afraid that if I start sorting and separating them, I'll end up using them again. In past attempts, when I set items aside, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to actually get rid of them, which led me right back to the same cycle.

I want advice on how to minimize the temptation to retrieve items I'm trying to let go, and break the cycle.",declutter,1741109502.0
Update for tiny kitchen,"So thank you for all the help and support!  I decided to get rid of the dishwasher and downsize dishes.

And I‚Äôm cleaning as I go which is easier when you have less stuff. 

So thank you all!  Much appreciated. ",declutter,1741109535.0

Can I make a game for myself out of it?,"Hey I'm new to the mindset of decluttering and don't really know where to start. So much of my stuff is sentimental and irreplaceable. But I think there's a lot I can get rid of hidden in the clutter. I was thinking about every day, or a couple times a week maybe, just rolling a die and whatever the number is is how many items I need to get rid of that day. I don't know if this is sustainable but I figured instead of looking at all my things and deciding whether to keep or get rid of I'm just looking for the things I can get rid of",declutter,1741130516.0

I'm halfway there! How do I keep it this way and deal with throwing-away remorse? Finding balance?,"I grew up in a semi-cluttered home, not extreme hoarding, but packed with stuff we refused to throw away. For eight people, most of it was needed, but after some family losses and moving out, I inherited a small 40sqm (430sqft) apartment that had basically been a storage unit. Three couches, a double bed, too many chairs, and endless *‚Äújust in case‚Äù* furniture.

At first, I had to do extreme decluttering just to make the space livable. That turned into extreme minimalism and a fear of owning anything because I *loved* how easy it was to clean when I had nothing. Now I am back to being a normal person and owning things because I have to and because I want to, but I am struggling hard.

The small space makes it difficult to stay organized. I keep falling into the trap of buying storage solutions that never seem to work, and no matter what, there is always some clutter on every surface. The place looks clean for maybe half an hour before daily life takes over.

I also struggle with consumables, mostly cleaning supplies and cosmetics. I *love* cleaning and testing new scents and strengths, so I hoard products under the sink. Same with bathroom products. How do you clean and *not* have a spa day after? On top of that, I *love* thrifting and antiquing. I don't think it's a problem, but it definitely adds to the amount of stuff I own. Maybe slightly dopamine-decorish.

How do you handle the regret of getting rid of things, especially when they are useful but just *too much*? And how do I keep my space livable without constantly feeling like I need to reorganize? :( I feel like I'm cleaning all the time and see no results!

Would love to hear from anyone who has been through this",declutter,1741172373.0
How to declutter closet during pregnancy,"Hello! May I ask for your advice on how to declutter closet during pregnancy? 90%of my clothes no longer fit at the moment and I don‚Äôt know when they would fit again, but I do have hopes and dreams to fit into them in an unforeseen future. I do love these clothes of mine and probably have lots of fear moving forward into the new season of motherhood. But if I manage to declutter and make space in the closet, I wouldn‚Äôt need to move (for the next 3-5 years if I can manage to not buy new clothes) so can save a bit more on rent. Also if I have less clothes, I‚Äôd have less laundry to do. So I‚Äôm definitely looking forward to that. ",declutter,1741172950.0
Closet clean out help,"We had a closet shelf break and what a blessing. I moved everything out and am slowly reorganizing now that it is fixed.  Just donated two bags off work clothes that do not fit my post kid body. Trying to only keep one type of thing. For example, I had 3 v neck black sleeveless tops. One was definitely the best in terms of quality and fit so the other two were donated.  I am also trying to make outfits, not just have random items.  

How do you select tees, blazers, hoodies? These are my next three sections. Pants and skirts were easy as I either fit them, or not. And some of the skirts just were not my style anymore.",declutter,1741196042.0
Made a Target run and only bought stuff off my list!,"This doesn‚Äôt seem like much but is actually huge for me. I needed to pick up tortillas and cheese last minute for taco night (I know, on a Wednesday, sacrilege!). And as tempting as it was (especially the seasonal gardening section), I only bought what was on my list.

So far this year I‚Äôve donate 13 bags and two boxes of stuff that I don‚Äôt need. While a lot of it has been gifts that I never used, some things were definitely regretted spontaneous purchases. So I know I need to try to stop buying things that I didn‚Äôt plan carefully or absolutely need. 

So this is my small victory! I am hoping that I‚Äôll finally be able to change my behavior to break this cycle of overwhelming clutter in my home. ",declutter,1741197083.0
who else grew up poor and feel guilt when decluttering?,"I threw out some old essential oils that were gifted to me and felt guilt because they would have been a luxury item growing up. My old mindset would have been to use it to the very last drop by adding it into a cleaning routine and then clean out the bottle and keep it for something. I was able to toss them out but felt guilty and I know this is probably keeping me from decluttering as much as I'd like.

I do my best to donate and recycle what I can, but not everything can be.

Friday 15: Junk mail!,"Approach your paper piles! You're going to pull out all the junk mail and dispose of it. Junk mail includes:

* Anything addressed to ""Resident"" or ""Home owner.""
* The supermarket ad that you'll never read because you use the store's app.
* Random charitable appeals, political flyers, and such. (Obviously, stay in touch with charitable and political institutions you *choose* to participate in.)
* Impersonal birthday cards sent by places you buy things from. (Obvs, make sure there's not a coupon in them first!)
* The big envelope of coupons that all expired last month and are typically for BOG50 at a restaurant on the other side of town, between the hours of 2:15 and 4:15 in the afternoon.

Junk mail leaves immediately! If you're agonizing over the perfect way to dispose of it, just throw it in the trash in the same bag with something disgusting. Nobody is going to pick through cat litter to discover that Home Owner lives at your address.

While you're with the pile, sort it into things that require immediate attention and those that require filing.

Found a way to declutter some books!,"""Success"" at a stretch but no other flair really fit.

Now, the obvious would be to just dump them all at a thrift store/library/used book store/whatever. We're talking novels  that I've acquired from exactly these types of locations, after all.

But for the purpose of this post, I'm more interested in the ""share a book"" mindset of the outdoor libraries. And at some point when the weather's better I do want to drive around town with a map to the local LFL to find new places to leave my offerings.

But for now? The breakroom where I work has a table with a pile of books on it, and a sign reminding people that March is National Reading Month (United States) and asking employees to bring books to share with one another.

It took a while but I got there,"I joined this sub-reddit to find like-minded people who got the situation and weren't judgmental about it. Would understand how big the achievement was. And if I could help a few people, that's great.

So context, I have OCD so my ""clutter"" is that and hoarding tendencies I inherited from my hoarder dad. I have been in a functional depression since I got body slammed by both my parents dying within 18 months of each other, being made homeless and jobless and having to move the 3 bed family home with me. 

I got a job I'm still at and I moved but it has been 5 years. We had a whole pandemic. I just never had the energy or desire to fix the clutter. I had a bathroom that was not functional because I was trying to make use of items that there wasn't anything wrong with. I had cupboards filled with clothes I would never wear. I had doom piles. I had an excess of cleaning products I didn't use because they comforted my OCD. On my birthday, (Feb 3rd) my brother who is the opposite of me in this respect said to me, ""you have a lot of stuff"" which sounds fine but I know exactly what he meant. We grew up in the same house. It annoyed me because inside I agreed but I had no energy to tackle the mammoth task.

Now, the success part, I started Zoloft on the highest dose I've ever been on (100mg) in Jan and at week 8, I had a surge of energy and the burning desire to yeet anything that did not serve me.

I have spent the last week destroying my clutter. I have donated via collection 7 clothing bags, 2 book bags, I have a basket of stuff to donate locally, I did 6 recycling break down trips and ripped out 10 bags of trash. No cupboard or wardrobe was untouched. I reorganised my systems. I repurposed items that I hoarded (pillows???). My home is no longer a safety hazard that something might fall out of a cupboard and brain you. Showering doesn't require anything beyond me getting into the dang thing.

Sometimes it feels like you can't get there after so long but you can. I believe in you.

"I am committing to getting rid of, or finding a home for, at least 5 things a day this month","I have an all or nothing mindset about decluttering where I keep waiting for that magical motivation to surface and enable me to hyperfocus and clean out a whole closet or something. Well you can imagine how infrequently that happens.

For this month I am committing to 5 things a day. Minimum. I should have no problem finding at LEAST five things to either get rid of, or put in its proper place. Even if it‚Äôs one thing in five rooms. I‚Äôm hoping a whole month of just moving the needle a little bit will add up. If I get the motivation to tackle a huge project, all the better.

I am keeping a summary log in my Notes app with a running tally of items. 

Five things is such a low bar that it‚Äôs easy to meet it. I can of course go above and beyond; today I moved or rehomed 17 things because I got on a roll and basically cleaned out under my bathroom cabinet! A project I‚Äôve been putting off for several years, literally done in three minutes!! This method works well with my ADHD and occasional depression; commit to doing a bare minimum daily and allowing myself to stop when meeting my goal. Some days I will go beyond, and some days I will do only five.

Moving was always a hassle to pack everything and added a ton of boxes to take with me.

Decluttering deceased spouse's belongings.,"Many years ago, my spouse died rather suddenly and traumatically. I will not provide any additional information on his death as it is not relevant. At the time I was lost in grief and dealing with pregnancy hormones. I had a few days to pack his belongings and I kept everything because it felt wrong to get rid of his stuff. It's been almost 12 years and I need to purge it before our child starts going through it. I thought it had been long enough and I could do this objectively. I was wrong. I went through a single crate and realized I was trying to keep 90% of it. I had memories attached to everything, but unfortunately our kid doesn't, because she never had an opportunity to form a bond with him. 

How do I know what's important? How many band tees are too many to keep? Should I keep every doodle and journal? I'm fixating on the possessions because his family is mostly deceased except a great aunt we are very close too and the majority of his old friends are dead/prison/addicts. I don't have anyone's memories to offer her but my own and great aunts.

For instance 10-15 boxes of very old (1930's to 1970's) science fiction books. I am unboxing and removing the books so they are packed properly, labeled and easy to carry when we move. So far I have reduced 8 boxes to 4. I still have at least 8 more boxes to go through but at the end I will have reduced the bulk without actually getting rid of anything. I took 4 totes of photographs and turned that into 2 by taking photos out of old frames and scanning the ones of mine that I felt were important, keeping a few and discarding the rest of mine. He has a giant tote that is all just his family photo books that I refuse to touch. I have found multiple boxes of cds my husband wants to keep. I am thinking of storing these in totes like the dvds. I also have a couple boxes of ""keepsakes"" that are all wrapped up in paper for moving. I am not sure if I should repack those or just leave them be.

How do i downsize 3 shoe boxes worth of junk journaling materials?,"for those that don‚Äôt know junk journaling is a type of journaling where you use scrap material and stuff throughout your day to make your spread.

I‚Äôve always wanted to junk journal hence why i‚Äôve always collected materials for it but i haven‚Äôt actually started practicing journaling until recently. Because i got rid of so much other clutter in my life, i feel like i now actually have time for it. And while i am serious about journaling now, i feel like i haven‚Äôt been able to dive into junk journaling bc the decision fatigue is so big, bc how do i possibly know what to use out of 3 shoe boxes worth of paper.

Estate Clean Out Help,"What is the best way to tackle cleaning out an estate after a loved one has passed? I know to start with perishables in the fridge/freezer and trash but I feel so overwhelmed. 

My grandma lived in her home for 70+ years and she was meticulous and organized but there's lots of things of course.

Then I wander around her home opening various cupboards and cabinets just to feel like idk where to start so i don't start at all ü´†

The Line Between Sparking Joy and Taking Up Space,"Currently decluttering my video game collection as I live in a city, have moved multiples times and will probably do so again, and am starting to build up a career that doesn‚Äôt let me engage in the hobby like I used to. 

I loved video games as a kid and kept almost everything I had from the systems to the games. I always thought it would be so cool to grow up and have this great collection to show off and play with again‚Ä¶ but I realized I hardly do that right now with the games I have. 

I started by donating the ones I knew I would never play. Then I moved onto the systems themselves. Some of them are really neat and I think are cool reminders of where the technology was at the time they came out.

They all technically sparked joy and brought back fond memories‚Ä¶but I don‚Äôt think I needed to keep them in a closet to remind me of that. 

I‚Äôm happy to say I‚Äôm more than halfway through. I‚Äôve sold and donated about six different video game consoles, and a countless amount of games. It feels really nice to know that someone else is enjoying them. 

I‚Äôm still keeping a few that I know aren‚Äôt available on the internet in case I wanna play it again down the road, but it feels almost transcendental to move on from my attachment to this idea of a collection. The closet space is also quite nice!

Anyone else majorly declutter kids rooms while they are away?,"How old were they and how did it go?

I decluttered my 6yo‚Äôs room yesterday while he was at school. I did it kind of on a whim so I didn‚Äôt warn him I was going to. He is such a little hoarder and every attempt to tidy up his room while he is present is a fight, even if I do all the work. I did not expect this to go particularly well, but I was trying to wash his sheets and just got so fed up trying to get to his bed. I did not throw away anything and kept it all in a box just in case.

Time saved from decluttering,"I've never considered myself to have much of an issue with clutter. However, I have at times balked a bit about getting rid of things. My wife, however, loves getting rid of things--almost to an extreme. Together, we have come to the conclusion that time is our most important commodity, and this helps guide our decluttering decisions. 

Our golden rule: Will keeping this item save us time or cost us time over the next two years? 

Granted, the rule is somewhat subjective. But, it lets us think in terms of something other than money or space.

Example application: I have a box of old cables of various purposes. Video, audio, USB, computer cables, power cords, etc. We recently went through the box and threw a lot of cables away. The thought process was, will this cable save me time in the next two years? If the cable was unique and in good shape, it would get saved (it could save a trip to the store to get one). But if it was a duplicate, it was likely just going to make finding the cable I actually need harder to find, and at that point it had more potential to cost time than to save time. Or if the cable was unlikely to be used in the next two years, it would probably go away. Am I going to use that old S-Video cable I used with my VCR in the next two years? No, so it's not going to save me time. Send it away. 

Example with clothing: I have a drawer full of socks and underwear. We generally do laundry twice a week, and it's uncommon that I would ever need more than about seven pairs of socks. But... a few times each year we miss a laundry day due to other commitments. If I run out of socks, I would either need to do laundry at an inconvenient time, wear dirty socks (ick), or run to the store and buy more. The extra sock supply is quite likely to save me time more than once in the coming year. So the sock drawer stays well-stocked (well-socked?) 

Anyway, the rule has generally been working well. It may not always apply in all circumstances, but it's a nice change from some of the other guidelines or there.

Doing a full house declutter and feeling lost and overwhelmed,"I seriously started this journey last week. I‚Äôve been wanting to declutter since we moved into this house, but have always been too lazy to actually do it. I‚Äôm now determined to make this happen and finally feel comfortable in my house. 

For context, we moved into a property my parent‚Äôs own 4 years ago and it‚Äôs full of their stuff as well as ours. My parents have always been borderline hoarders and I was never taught proper cleaning skills from them. I‚Äôve only ever been taught ‚Äúif it‚Äôs not trash it‚Äôs worth keeping‚Äù and ‚Äúif you paid money for it, you can‚Äôt throw it out‚Äù. I work 5-6 days a week and my day(s) off I usually spend trying to recover. But I‚Äôm determined now to make my house a home - not a prison in which I feel nothing but chaos. I also want to be able to have friends over/have my sons friends over and not be embarrassed by all the mess and clutter. I want to feel peace when I walk through my doors every night. My boyfriend and parents don‚Äôt care at all about how much shit is in the house and it‚Äôs super discouraging. My boyfriend is also a borderline hoarder, so I feel super alone in this process. I love him and he‚Äôs so far been encouraging of the process, but I know he doesn‚Äôt care enough to spend a day and declutter with me. My son is 11 and doesn‚Äôt know anything other than living in clutter. I want to be an example for him that a clean living space is achievable.

I started in our master bathroom and tossed two trash bags worth of products we will never use/expired products. We all couldn‚Äôt believe how much shit we actually had in there that wasn‚Äôt being used. It felt so good to be able to do a whole room in one day. I now have counter space and everything has its place in the bathroom, so I‚Äôm confident I can keep it clean. 

I moved into working on our living space this week. I‚Äôve already thrown away 4 trash bags worth of stuff and started a decent donations pile. Today I made good headway on our ‚Äújunk corner‚Äù I call it that because that‚Äôs where we put stuff when we clean and NEVER go back to look at it. I wish I had the will power to toss it all, but I started to feel sentimental towards certain things, and some things I don‚Äôt want to toss because they are my boyfriends, not mine. I‚Äôm hoping the tidier our place becomes, the more willing I am to let stupid little things go. I just couldn‚Äôt today. I threw out half of what was in the corner and the other half I kept. I feel so discouraged I couldn‚Äôt just detach from it all and toss everything. I haven‚Äôt looked at most of that crap in almost 4 years. Why couldn‚Äôt I toss it?! 

I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about this. I feel silly being attached to so much stuff that I don‚Äôt ever interact with. Our house is just so big I don‚Äôt see how I will get through the whole thing. Sorting through 5 peoples stuff by myself is tedious. I have piles of stuff to give back to my parents that I know they will want, and I have made the executive decision to get rid of stuff I know for a fact they don‚Äôt even remember is here. They‚Äôre getting older and where they live is already over run with stuff. I feel guilty for piling more on them as well as tossing stuff at my own discretion. 

Sorry for such a long rant that is all over the place. I just needed to vent about something that is weighing so heavily on me. 

Has anyone with a larger home gone through a full house purge? How long did it take? Honestly any words of encouragement or tips to make it more manageable would be much appreciated. I just want a home I feel comfortable in. This house has so much potential to be gorgeous. I want to be proud to have people over for visits and comfortable with my son‚Äôs friends coming over.

Stuff that 'might come in useful',"Over the last 3 years I've been making progress with getting rid of things in storage which I've realised I will never use, or which I can't afford to take when I move overseas. 

And a flood a few years ago made me realise that the 'sentimental' items I was keeping didn't have the sentimental value I thought they did. I dried out and restored precisely one thing out of the hundreds that were ruined by the flood.

But I'm still keeping a lot of stuff because it's 'perfectly good' or 'might come in useful'. 

The trouble is, when I do need a ratchet screwdriver or a pry bar or an anti-fungal spray or a lighter summer jacket, I need one NOW, not in a storage unit 100 miles away. It costs time and money to go there and fetch the item - more time and money than it does to buy another one locally.

So I'm gradually realising that those kinds of need-it-now item aren't worth keeping if I know that I can source a replacement in any location I'm likely to be in.

I should only be keeping them if they're both hard to source a replacement for, and possible to do without for the time it would take me to fetch the stored one.",declutter,1741880530.0
Getting rid of parents books after they died,"I‚Äôve been gradually and painfully trying to sort through everything in the house after my dad passed away 2 years ago and my mum last year. Both my parents had deep interest and expertise in their fields of work, and kept lots of specialist books on the subjects. My dad also was a voracious reader and had plenty of fiction, history, anything he would have an interest in. He was also a hoarder which makes this all a lot harder.

Now that they‚Äôre gone I‚Äôve struggled to part with many of these books, even though my intention isn‚Äôt to keep a hoard of my parent‚Äôs belongings. The big stumbling block I come up against is feeling like there‚Äôs this repository of knowledge they worked to gain over the course of their lives, much of which could be hard to find from other easily available sources. When I was younger I wouldn‚Äôt have had much interest in the topics of some of these, but as I‚Äôve got older and find myself curious about topics that might have seemed dull or old fashioned in earlier life, I find it hard to trust that I won‚Äôt come to regret getting rid of this library. I also no longer have the chance to ask my parents to share their knowledge when I need it and many of these books feel like the last connection to that.

I‚Äôm sure this falls into the behaviour of keeping things ‚Äòjust in case‚Äô, but the leap from having these possessions within touching distance to a future when it‚Äôs all irreversibly gone feels very hard to make.",declutter,1741885156.0

READ ALONG: Zasio intro & chapter 1,"Welcome to our read-along of Dr. Robin Zasio's *The Hoarder in You: How to Live a Happier, Healthier, Uncluttered Life.* Get your library copy and join in! Posts will contain some material from the book, but you'll get more out of it if you have the whole book. (This is not sponsored in any way. It just seemed like an idea.) There will be posts 3x a week: Friday, Sunday, and Wednesday (using U.S. Pacific time zones).

There will be quizzes and/or exercises with each post!

**Introduction**

Dr. Zasio admits to the existence of The Make-Up Drawer. 

>There are crumbling eye shadows in colors I haven't worn in years, and dried-up eye liners, pencils, and lipsticks that I loved when I purchased them (though after applying them for the first time, realized they weren't right for me). Rather than throwing away the useless lipsticks, which felt like a waste, I thought ""What if I need them? You never know...""

**Chapter 1** introduces the premise of the book: ""The way hoarders think about their possessions is in many ways not terribly different from the way non-hoarders approach the stuff in their lives."" That reasoning?

* I'm afraid I'll need it later
* It would be wasteful
* It was a good deal
* Someone I love gave it to me

The difference between a non-hoarder and a hoarder is ""a hoarder is unable to take into account important factors like whether keeping an item may cause him more harm than good.""

If you have access to the book, please comment on anything that struck you in the Introduction or Chapter One!

**Exercise:** What's your Make-Up Drawer (the place you can't bring yourself to declutter even though you know you should)? If your first impulse is to say ""my whole house,"" stop and identify a smaller spot to tackle. This is going to be your initial place to declutter as we work through the book, though you can obviously work on other areas of your home.",declutter,1741955493.0

But sometimes I wake up and the sun is shining and I feel good but I'm tired of looking at that junk I haven't touched in years and God willing I will die of old age before I get through all these half-used pencils, BURN IT ALL DOWN, and I throw out that lotion and that sock without the tears and angst and *my preciouses.*  I get so much done on those days and if I can keep the momentum going I get so much done.

I saw my donated item out in the wild,"Hey everyone! About a year ago I donated a specialty shawl from a country very dear to me. Now this shawl had a very unique combination of pattern and colors as well as tassels - very distinguishable from other shawls (this becomes important later). As an art object, it was beautiful, but it was not my style for wearing at all, so I decided to pass it on.

Flash forward to last weekend. I drove three hours to a small town that was putting on a play by a writer from the aforementioned country. So I‚Äôm watching this play and all of a sudden, BOOM, costume change! And one of the actresses comes out in a dress with her shoulders covered by, you guessed it, my shawl that I had donated a year ago, about a hundred miles away. It was unmistakably the same shawl, as those kinds are just not produced or sold anywhere around here. 

I was super happy to know that my shawl was living a good life and honored that the costume designer managed to get her hands on such an authentic piece for a play so far away from where I originally donated it. It now forms part of an art form enjoyed by hundreds of viewers instead of lying there unworn in my drawer.

READ ALONG Zasio chapter 2,"This is a big chapter, full of rationales that people put ahead of having a pleasant space. The list of examples is long, but they fall into four broad categories:

1. Storing evidence of the past: gear from long-ago hobbies, clothes from lifestyles you no longer live, trophies and T-shirts from old achievements, college textbooks you haven't opened again.
2. Stockpiling items to serve a hypothetical future: keeping things for grandchildren, buying for a house that's years away, stocking up for hobbies you don't have time to do.
3. Holding onto large amounts of things ""just in case"" or because ""they could be useful"" -- without having a concrete near-term use-case for them.
4. Self-punishment: holding onto items that remind you of bad times, or that tell you you've become a worse person.

Zasio's ""take action"" suggestions all amount to weighing whether not-having the item would really make things better or worse. So let's try that, with one of her quizzes. (As always, open discussion on anything in this chapter is welcome, too!)

**Exercise**. Pick an item in your home (preferably in your problem area from chapter 1) and ask yourself:

1. What do you feel when you see the item?
2. How did you acquire it?
3. Why do you keep it?
4. What do you think it would mean if you got rid of it?

Tricked kids into decluttering with me,"As an adult with some inattention issues, I frequently end up creating ""boxes of doom"" when decluttering. Sometimes I just need a clear surface to think straight and then lose steam before it's all put away. (I have read Dana K White and do try to practice one thing at a time, but it's a process.) 

The parenting trick: I told my girls (7 & 4) we were doing a reverse scavenger hunt! I walked them around their playroom to remind them of certain containers and then gathered all my boxes of doom. I handed each kid an item and told them where it went. They took off running to put it in it's place, then came back and I paid them in monopoly money. We did this for almost an hour, got all the boxes sorted, and the kids had a blast! They made 63 trips in total, all over the house. I also had a trash bag next to me to easily toss things.

It helped me so much to just send off each item as I picked it up instead of pulling out everything, sorting it into various piles, and then making all the trips myself. For instance, there were Legos in three of the four piles. No problem, the kids ran to the Lego table four times. 

Bonus, we worked on counting and making change with the monopoly money (yay educational moment) and they now know where certain things go. Hopefully they'll be able to help keep things tidy in the future. We did this all yesterday and my littlest already asked if we can do it again today.",declutter,1742146019.0
Took 2 weeks off work and spent the first week decluttering and got so much done!!!!!,"My husband and I took 2 weeks off work and decided to dedicate the first week to decluttering. We even got a bonus day at the beginning because his boss called as he was heading to work that day and asked if he wanted to take 1 more day of PTO. He took it, came home, and got started immediately. 

In the past week we've done 3 Goodwill runs with the back of the car filled with boxes and bags of items we no longer need, filled our outdoor trash and recycling bins to the brim twice, sold 37 items on eBay ($1452.79 after fees but excluding shipping supplies cost), mailed off a box of old eyeglasses to a charity, and went through 90% of the stuff in our apartment. 

We also got some spring cleaning projects done like cleaning out the dryer vent. We even discovered that there was a hole in one of the connections and now we know why our bathroom (where our washer and dryer are) was always coated in lint. We replaced it and hopefully the lint accumulation will finally slow down. 

We still have some stuff left to declutter like under the bathroom and kitchen sinks and the garage and I have more stuff to list on eBay but we're exhausted so we're going to take it pretty easy for the next week and maybe just get 30-60 minutes of decluttering and spring cleaning projects done per day. 

If you can swing this, I highly recommend doing it. It feels like we just moved to a new place. There are some little messes here and there but it's nothing like it was before. I wish I had taken before pictures.",declutter,1742147259.0
Remove from house or put in basement to sell later?,"Decision making:

How do you decide to 1) remove the item from your house (donate, recycle, throw out etc) or 2) is there realistically room to store item for longer to sell later? Is there enough energy to do it ?

I rented a dumpster this weekend and threw almost everything away. I pretty quickly realized when I started working that mice (god I hope it‚Äôs mice) had gotten in at some point and chewed through *everything*. Bags of soil. An old bag of dog food.

Movers or junk removal service?,"Hello!

I have a few old items to remove from the household, and I live with an elderly relative who is not fit to help me in the removal. I am thinking about hiring a mover to just move the large items to the curb and have the waste company pick them up, but I am also wondering about junk removal services. The items are as follows:

* A broken 42 inch flat panel TV (first floor)
* Old queen-size mattress (2nd floor)
* An exercise machine (2nd floor)
* Old metal workbench (garage)
* Broken fountain (in several pieces, back yard)

Do movers perform these ""move items from dwelling to the curb"" type ""moves,"" and roughly how much do you think these items would cost to ""move"" or junk?

If they are too expensive, I might just slow-haul (like moving the mattress couple flights of stair at a time, rest, repeat, and skip the workbench / fountain)

"I read only large text now and I'm thinking of getting rid of my old ""comfort"" paperbacks - thoughts?","I have some vision problems and somehow when the great middle aged change to my eyes came, reading glasses didn't help.

Over the years I've come to accept this and I got rid of a lot of books. I still have books that are reference books, as I can read for 10 minutes or so before it becomes really uncomfortable. And I have kept a lot of graphic novels, because the text is a bit larger and you're also looking at pictures so you can rest your eyes. 

But I struggle with my old books. We get so attached to them and they're a part of us. For example I've had the same paperback of Robin McKinley's *The Blue Sword* for literally decades. I've read it countless times. It's falling apart and well-loved. But the last time I tried to read it, I just gave up and checked out a digital copy from the library.

What to do about ‚Äúalmost‚Äù clothes.,"This isn‚Äôt in terms of sizing due to weight changes (e.g. ‚Äúif I lose 5 pounds this would legit fit perfectly‚Äù). This is in terms of unchangable aspects of clothes.

Some examples:

- A sweatshirt that is a unique color and has fun sleeve details, but is also super long and boxy, and only looks good tucked into one specific pair of jeans. And I‚Äôm not sure if altering it to be shorter will really fix the issue, and I‚Äôm hesitant to throw money into it if not. ($15-20 btw, I did ask two tailors.) It looks pretty cute with that one pair of jeans. It looks awful with just about anything else.

- A dress which if it were just a few inches longer would be perfect for work, and is very cute, but also wouldn‚Äôt look right with something underneath (like a longer skirt, or pants/leggings). But it also doesn‚Äôt work aesthetically for any other occasions in my life. MAYBE a dinner at a friend‚Äôs house or something. But it‚Äôs also short sleeved and doesn‚Äôt look as cute with a jacket or sweater (it works with a work blazer though), and I feel like most of my friends keep their houses cold lol. Anyway it‚Äôs cute but because it is so niche, I‚Äôve only worn it once in the past 5 years. (And yes, it still fits perfectly aside from the length)

- A romper which only works with one specific bralette that I own, and only looks good when I‚Äôm a bit tanned. Otherwise it‚Äôs a cute little brunch romper. Or maybe for a vacation somewhere warm, if I‚Äôm also not walking so much that I can‚Äôt wear sandals or fashion sneakers‚Ä¶ Again with it being so niche I‚Äôve only worn it 1-2 times in the past 3 years.

Anyway I have a good number of clothes that fall into this category. I‚Äôm torn on what to do with them, as in keep vs. get rid of. 

It‚Äôs also already very hard for me to find clothes that fit right to begin with. I‚Äôm short and few brands (except for mostly very expensive ones and only with certain aesthetics) make petites anymore, and it‚Äôs rare for me to find pants or tops I love so much that I‚Äôm willing to shell out the extra money and time for alterations. (I know Nordstrom offers free alterations on a lot of stuff, but their clothes often run expensive unless on sale) so I have a tendency to be like, ok maybe I should hold on to some of these ‚Äúalmost‚Äù clothes and make them work, along with the clothes I own that I actually do love and wear regularly‚Ä¶ I know this is totally illogical lol but my point being, I do have somewhat of a scarcity mindset as it‚Äôs rare for me to find good-quality, not radically expensive, clothes that I love and also fit me well. But I also want more room in my closet for when I do hopefully discover more of those clothes‚Ä¶ basically unicorn clothes lol, it‚Äôs pretty hard to find truly great ones these days!",declutter,1742179977.0
I have sooo many toys but I don't want to let go,"I 18f have so many toys and so much lego from my childhood and I just about have the space for it but honestly I'd probably be better off without it.
But the problem is I kind of view them as collections... 
I have 
1. A doll collection with some valuable dolls
2. A figurene collection
3. Stuffed animals and plushies
4. HEAPS of sylvanian families
5. Lego that I don't really view as a collection but I can see myself using again

I still have a big interest in toys and collecting so occasionally I also bring in new stuff that I prefer to display these days. So the amount gets even bigger... I really am having trouble letting go especially of my lego and dolls... 
It's not at hoarder level because I rarely bring new stuff in and keep it all organised, but my room just looks so damn childish and honestly it's too much stuff. 

My parents won't let me put it in the attic because our attic is bad and I don't want to move it to other parts of the house because then I'm just facilitating the problem, so everything stays in my room and it takes an age every spring to keep it all categorised and organised in case I ever decide to display it and because I'm a bit of a control freak...

But I want a room that looks a bit more adult now where I can still display some of my collection in a more orderly fashion. I want a calm room. 
Rn my room is like a 9 year olds because my parents won't let me paint it either... So all I have is de cluttering! 

Will I regret it if I let go of some of the weaker links in my collection? 
For example the dolls are very special to me but only some of them are actually in good condition for display. The rest are kinda just for customisation/ barbies I played with and they sit in a box...It takes up so much space.

My lego i'm keeping cuz I have loads and whenever I do pull it out I actually still have fun with it but I haven't done that in years... But what if I have a kid and they like lego??? 
I don't wanna let it go...

"Getting rid of old broken things is harder for me than getting rid of new, unused ones...","Hi everyone,

I'm new on this subreddit, but I've started my decluttering journey a couple of years ago. So far so good, the only items I have trouble with are books (I love books and buying books) and skincare (I still haven't found the perfect routine, and I keep trying new products that often ruin my skin, hurray). Other than that, my home is practically clutter-free.

  
I've noticed, however, that it is way easier for me to throw away something if it is new or almost unused (e.g. a skincare product I dislike), rather than an old object that I've used for years but is now destroyed. 

I just bought a new sports bag because the one I've been using for more than ten years is ripped and stained, so it was high time I replaced it. However, now that I have to throw the old one away, I feel horribly bad. It's like throwing away an old friend, and all the memories attached to it. I took it with me to my beach vacations in Spain, I loved the fact that each pocket had its special use, and I feel like by throwing it away, it's a period of my life that I'm throwing away with it, and it won't come back. I know what I'm saying makes no sense, and whether or not I keep this bag I won't use it anymore, so why would I keep it? I still find it very hard to throw it out, though.

Full house declutter update!,"First off I want to thank everyone who gave me tips and words of encouragement on my last post. I thought about you guys through all of my declutterring and cleaning that went on this week and it really helped keep me motivated and held myself accountable for doing at least something everyday.  

So for my victories:

1. I cleared out our front door area. When you come into the house now it‚Äôs CLEAR. There is a small shoe rack and 3 dog leashes for our 3 dogs. This has been great, because I don‚Äôt immediately feel overwhelmed/overstimulated when I come home. 

2. I cleaned the pantry out. Got rid of any expired food or food I knew would never get eaten. I also reorganized so we actually know what we have. 

3. I cleared out two junk drawers. There‚Äôs actually room in both of them now. I, again, couldn‚Äôt believe how much crap we were holding onto!

4. Cleaned out my old shipping/tool cabinet. I used to be an artist that sold a lot of stuff online and I had half a cabinet dedicated to recycled shipping supplies and the other half dedicated to random tools. I don‚Äôt ship stuff anymore so I got rid of ALL OF IT! I didn‚Äôt feel guilting since it was all reused bubble mailers and bubble wrap. I was able to fit all the tools back in and have room for other things that don‚Äôt need to live on the counter. 

5. I got almost all of our Christmas decorations taken down and back in our spare bedroom. The spare bedroom will be a project for another time, but having all our Christmas stuff down feels so good. 

6. I cleaned up our entertainment area. Not much was trash, but since I‚Äôve been able to declutter a decent amount in the house, I was able to find homes for a lot of the things that previously laid on the floor. 

7. Probably my most proud achievement this week. I actually took all the donations to the thrift shop today. I drive a larger suv, so I put the third row down, and FILLED the trunk. I dropped it all off today and now I don‚Äôt have the donation pile to look at.

8. The only thing I purchased this week (other than groceries) was a small dollar store tote to put dog toys in. The past two weeks of working on the house I‚Äôve noticed that I have nowhere to pickup and put dog toys. So a small little tote now holds all of their toys and it‚Äôs accessible for them to grab toys out of.

System to determine how many clothes you need,"Hi,

This might be a long shot, but I hope someone here knows what I am talking about an can help me. I am kind of frustrated because I know I read this somewhere, and now that I want to work on my wardrobe and declutter my clothes, I can't find it anymore.

Someone somewhere on the internet had a system to determine how many clothes you actually need, based on your real life. I am not sure exactly how it works anymore, but I think it was based on how many times you do laundry and how many times you (for example) exercise between laundry days. There were also some kind of rule about work clothes and casual clothes, pyjamas, shoes, etc. to determine how many you needed. Or maybe it was about how many times you wear work-wear per month or something?

I have searched my laptop files, Google, YouTube and Reddit, but I can't find it and I don't know anymore what it (the system) was called. Does anyone know what I am looking for and can provide me a link or description or something?

Success! Finished sorting deceased MILs home,"For the last 6 months, my husband and I have been sorting my MIL enormous and entirely too packed home. With the help of many friends, and grueling work, we have completed our mission to sort through everything. 

What is left is for the estate sale. We have an angel for an agent who has helped us make some presales, including 4k hardback books, fine silver, and 400 dolls. 

We donated 2k+ garments, 800+ shoes, 4k paperbacks (to the library), enough art/craft supplies to fill a 10x10 room, and so much more. And we filled a 15 yard dumpster and a 20 yard dumpster already. 

Estate sale company has taken over, and will be prepping for 5 weeks to get ready for the sale at the end of April. 

I'm so proud of us, and proud of myself for not completely losing it during this process. It's hard to comprehend that we're done. There was so much to do, and 100s of hours have been spent sorting through everything.  

I'm so grateful for the friends who have come over to help us, including a friend who has been living in the house since MIL passed. That is such a huge weight off our shoulders that we don't have to worry about the property. And I'm so grateful for the estate sale agent who is ready to get it done for us.

This was the last straw üôÑ,"The wardrobe collapsed a few weeks ago. Terrible timing as it was two days before we went away on holiday. The house has been in in complete chaos ever since as I had to empty it all out before it did any more damage .  But I couldn't get it sorted before we went away. 

Since our return, I've been laid low with a bug I picked up but I was determined to make sure that when we finally repaired the wardrobe, nothing (and I mean nothing) was going back in without purpose. I found so much stuff that I'd forgotten I had. (A dozen pairs of leggings, more scarves than you could wrap a mummy in, shapewear)  It was all tidy, it all fitted in my lovely organisational boxes, but I'd never missed any of it, let alone used any of it, since it was first 'organised'. So every day, I've done maybe 15 minutes of sorting because I haven't had the energy to do any more. 

I'm already on 4 full bags for donation with more to go. I thought I'd been really good in listing 5 pairs of tagged, unworn leather boots straight on Vinted. I'd intended to give them 2 weeks then they'd be donated - I thought it would make me feel better about the waste of money if I could at least recoup a little bit back. 

That was until this morning when I was getting ready for a last minute doctors appointment. Because everything is everywhere at the moment (he's promised the wardrobe will be fixed this weekend) the boots are lined up next to the bed. In my rush I just tripped over them and fell. I think I was lucky not to break my wrist. Anyway, that's just the push (üòÇ) I needed. I got back from my appointment, delisted everything and put it all in another bag to donate. No more answering questions like 'are the boots comfortable?' I don't know- they've never been on my feet! No more feeling insulted that someone wants them for nothing....nope, it's not worth the stress to try to sell. I've always wavered between sell/ donate. No more!

A lot of them have only been worn once and some still have the tags on. I have taken out about half of them that I no longer like or would never wear again. I'm feeling really guilty about all the money I spent on them, I know I could list them on Vinted but I feel I really don't have the mental capacity for that right now. I have a young family and we are moving in 6 weeks or so there is a lot to do as the house is jam packed. I'm torn between trying to recoup some money by selling what I can in the next few weeks or just cutting my losses and giving it all to charity. I feel guilty about the money spent and part of me is wondering whether to hold on to them and try and sell them once I've moved. What would you do?",declutter,1742498178.0
Piano decluttering (30 yo digital),"I have an electric piano with fully weighted keys which has a number of sounds such as grand piano, etc. it is 30 years old but in excellent condition. I bought it as a reward for finishing a degree with every intention of improving my limited music skills. I spent $4,000 on it, which was a lot back then. (To me it still is.)

The kids took lessons and then stopped. I took a few lessons and stopped. Unfortunately, it has some very difficult memories associated with it and every time I tell myself I am going to start again, all those bad feelings and memories come back up. 

I decided it was time to let it go. I reached out to a company that specializes in buying and consigning pianos.  They won‚Äôt take it. They gave me the name of a removal company instead. 

It‚Äôs hurting my heart to think it‚Äôs going to the dump.

I don‚Äôt think I can sell it given the piano company‚Äôs response and if I put it for free on marketplace I still have to deal with the lookie loos and can‚Äôt face this. I also don‚Äôt want my neighbours being nosey as they don‚Äôt know I am planning on selling my house and this is part of that downsizing. I live alone and often get unsolicited advice about what I ‚Äúshould‚Äù do. 

Any insights on how to get this piano out of my life both physically and emotionally would be appreciated. FWIW it weighs 180 pounds and is small enough to fit into the back of my car. 

Thank you. I have been inspired by so many posts in this subreddit and appreciate your insights.

Edited for update: I tried many places to donate this digital piano and there were no takers. Every call I made or post I listed brought all the awful feelings up for that piano. Last night I had the hard emotional work of getting through a lot of really awful feelings. There were many tears, some scream crying and a bit of hyper ventilation. But I felt the feelings, drank some water and went to bed. Today the sun came up and my heart was not as sore. 

I had junk removers come in to do a small demolition and asked them if they could take a large bookcase. They said yes. And as they removed it I decided to take the courageous step to finally let the piano go. They loaded on the trailer and it‚Äôs gone. 

I did it. I let it go. Unfortunately it has gone to landfill but no one wanted it for free and now it is not in my face every day!! I have turned the page on that part of my life. 

This group inspires me and I am grateful!",declutter,1742501861.0

Getting rid of clothes.,"I have a beautiful walk in closet with a makeup station/vanity. I have a place for all my perfumes, shoes and handbags. Every year around spring I will declutter clothing.

Moving in 3 months and feeling overwhelmed.,"I basically have been moving my junk from one place to another for years. I have boxes I packed from the last apartment in this one still. 

We've spent the better part of the last few years cleaning and decluttering the house we'll be moving into while taking care of relatives. It's still very overwhelming. It's a mix of sentimental stuff for my husband, and 50 years of acquired shit they was left for us to deal with. It's his childhood home so dealing with all their junk has been emotional for him and he's resistant to deal with it (but eventually does when he's overwhelmed and sick of looking at it).

We've unfucked the basement for the most part and been storing our less needed stuff there while we clean and renovate the house. Renovations are finally underway and it's dawning on me that I will need to take everything I own in my apartment and find a home for it at the house, or get rid of it. 

We've also acquired quite of a bit in the last few years and we both own too much. We're both the scattered type of ADD/ADHD and live out of doom piles. I always kind of expected I would ended up with someone better/neater than me but as it turns out, we're both like this. Every horizontal surface is cluttered even when I clear them off every few months, it only takes a bit of time until they're covered in something new. 

We both own far too many clothes. We both have a band T-shirt addiction and we go a little nuts buying merch at shows since we can afford it. I have ideas to send off a fair amount to one of those T-shirt quilt places. There's also some weight gain on both of us over the years so we both have stuff we're ""saving"" for when we become ""skinny again"". Lol.

We also have a roommate who's stuff is mostly contained to his room so he's not contributing too much to the mess. 

I know it's likely just that I don't have any routines and I try to just do a bunch when I have energy but that energy doesn't come as often as it used to. 

I guess any advice would be awesome, even though I ""know"" what I need to do, the doing it is a completely different story. ",declutter,1742562242.0
Friday 15: Burden item!,"This week, we're going to choose one Burden Item. What's a Burden Item? It's a thing where thinking about why you *ought* to want to keep it, sell it, etc., consumes way more mental and emotional space than the value you get from the item.

Take your burden item. Thank it for its service (to you if you bought it, to the person who gave it to you if you got it from someone). Get rid of it. If you believe it's super-valuable, take the first steps to sell it *this weekend.* Otherwise, it's the donation bag or the trash.

"Parents passing on their clutter, by the car load","I have too much stuff; I admit it, and it's slowly improving, mainly through donating and car boot sales. I find it hard to stick to organisational systems, and if I don't see things they don't exist. A recent diagnosis of ADHD is helping to make sense of this for me. My own house is very much a work in progress, and as I live alone the main inconvenience is to me only.

But... my older parents method of decluttering is to fill vegetable trays (the ones you can get from Sainsburys) three at a time with various stuff, pass it to me at a time that I've got no opportunity to sort them for disposal (donate, sell, rubbish) and then repeat a few days later. These trays contain such random items that they usually take hours. I mostly end up stacking them in my hallway, where I become selectively blind to their existence. 

So, advice please? Aside from massively losing my patience with my parents, how can I get them to declutter in a way that doesn't just pass it all over to me? Thanks.",declutter,1742600187.0

[Spoiler] Netflix‚Äôs Less is Now - The Minimalists,"I‚Äôve just finished watching the second edition of Ryan and Joshua‚Äôs adventure (let‚Äôs put Ryan First for once, just to pretend he is not accessory to the immense ego of Joshua). 

I didn‚Äôt like it. I‚Äôm not the one to bash, as I loved the first one and it has been so important for my journey. But I didn‚Äôt like this second shot one bit. 

First of all, why? If we are on a journey to keep only what ADDS VALUE, why coming out with a second documentary repeating the same sentences over and over again? Well, unless it is to add value to their bank accounts...

By now we knew their personal stories and we knew about the consumer market and the benefit of minimalism just by watching the first documentary, so why another one? 
LESS IS MORE, let‚Äôs start applying the concept by not duplicating!

Matt D‚ÄôAvella direction is good as it was on the first occasion, with shots along the lines of modern documentaries although I personally didn‚Äôt like the music in most sequences.

The settings are as fake as it gets, ranging from a generic house to declutter to, and it‚Äôs worse, a studio decorated with mass-consumer-minimalistic-IKEA-like forniture.

The worst part for me was the overacting, especially from Joshua; it was awkward at times feeling like I was watching an audition for a high school play. 

I appreciate the effort and the theme is certainly important to me, but if there is nothing new to say maybe it would be better to say nothing at all. 
Or is this documentary another example of the readily-available consumerism?

Important Realization for Young People Starting to Live Alone - your parents no longer have a say in what you own.,"I recently moved out and my parents did everything they could to make my transition as smooth as possible, including providing me with a large amount of stuff from their house. I initially started bringing back things I didn't need but that was met with hostility, as my parents who want the best for me kept pushing that I keep everything just in case. 
It took a solid 6 months before I stumbled on an important truth: your parents (or anyone) no longer have a say in what you own or what your living quarters look like. That means they are unlikely to notice when you get rid of:
- clothes they got you but that you don't like
- furniture they might have given you
- excessive items, especially in the bathroom and kitchen.
Not sure how helpful this is, but it was like a weight removed off my shoulders, especially considering their disapproval of minimalism.
Hope this can be helpful for someone in a smiliar situation!

Unpopular opinion: I do NOT hate the minimalists,"After reading about 80 times in this sub that the minimalists suck and the second documentary is also garbage, that Joshua is kind of arrogant, and so much more, I gave it a lot of thought. But I found out, I still like them.

You guys are right about them making and selling themselves as a brand in a way, but that's how you generate reach isn't it? In a perfect society this might not be necessary, but in ours it is. And the more people they reach with minimalism, the better (how ironic). I don't think their marketing is over the top though, for example I didn't even know they sold merch until I read about it in this sub.

I would never have found minimalism without them. 

And if you, as experienced minimalists, think they're repetitive and you're no longer getting value from it, then just stop listening to their podcast, maybe just for a while. But is that a reason to hate them? 

Personally, I don't think it's that bad, because it keeps me on track. I also found the second documentary actually enjoyable to watch, I only got a negative feeling when I read your opinions in this sub.

Sure the hugging without asking is weird, sure in parts they suggest methods that are out of the question for me personally, etc. But we can all think.

I was addicted to shopping. I only identified myself by the things I owned. I wore designer clothes, always had to have the latest iPhone and a TV for thousands of dollars. Even my water had to come from a ""cool"" brand. And much more. All that while having debt.

Something growing up poor taught me that I didn‚Äôt realise until I was an adult,"A common side effect of growing up poor is growing up in a cluttered house because nothing was ever thrown away.

Until I was an adult I thought that only actual literal *rubbish* was thrown away. This made decluttering hard, because I was trying too hard to repair/repurpose/donate/sell everything. Bags of clothes would sit in my car for months, broken items would stay in my house with the intention of fixing to either sell or donate, but of course no one would probably want it anyway.

Minimalism made me realise I dislike my tattoos.,"Now, hear me out. How did that happen, you may ask? 
When I first got into minimalism, I never even considered my tattoos as something that I would once regret getting. In fact, I never thought that would happen. Lately, however, I began to realise one thing. As I‚Äôm spending almost no time on Instagram or other social media beside Reddit , my desire for getting more tattoos is dwindling. I couldn‚Äôt find anything worth getting inked on my body anymore. I wasn‚Äôt getting any more input from outside and all my ideas seemed bland and unimportant. That made me question ... why was I getting tattoos in the first place ? 
You must know, by now I have two shoulder pieces connecting into a chest piece , a patchwork sleeve and a few pieces on my legs. I used to pride myself in calling myself a tattoo collector and getting new pieces on a whim. I would use these pieces to signal my interests to other people. 
Now, I‚Äôm starting to think I don‚Äôt want to do that anymore. I don‚Äôt feel the need to signal my belonging to a certain group to anyone anymore. It‚Äôs the same thing as wearing band merch or brand signs , only on a much more permanent scale. Or with fashion and style. My sheer interest in certain topics validated my belonging into those spaces. I don‚Äôt need ink on my skin to do that for me. 

My main issue now is that I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äûdone‚Äú with what I had in mind. My arm still has gaps that‚Äôd need filling for me to be happy with the whole concept, the existing tattoos are good but not perfectly to my liking and my chest piece is unsymmetrical. It just feels very cluttered to me. 

Getting laser removal is not an option due to the darkness and amount of pieces. The only sensible option for me is to, at one point, cover it all up with large scale blackwork. I still really like tattoos so that isn‚Äôt an issue for me, but I do wish I hadn‚Äôt started getting them in the first place. 

On the one hand, it‚Äôs very freeing to break free from that persona that I so meticulously crafted for myself over all those years, but on the other hand it‚Äôs also scary. These pieces of art aren‚Äôt books or T-shirt‚Äôs that I can just toss out.

"Yes, unfriending ""friends"" on social media is counted as de-cluttering","I posted a few days ago about how I de-cluttered my room by getting rid of all the unnecessary things that I didn't even know was there, and it gave me a sense of freedom. Not because I have more space to put in new stuff, but because I was rid of all the unnecessary things I was holding on to. So I figured, why stop with just things?

I read about digital minimalism some time ago, and it turns out, you could be just as cluttered online as you are with your surroundings. So I thought maybe I should de-clutter my social media as well.

Just a bit of background, I have deleted a lot of my social media accounts (Twitter, instagram, snapchat), I kept reddit, because reddit is awesome, and Youtube, because it's like my TV. I also kept facebook but only because my school gives important announcements there instead of our institutional emails for some reason, I don't really use it as much.

So in order to make my social media use intentional, I starting purging my facebook since last year, deleting all my posts up until 2009, making all my photos private, removing my personal info (such as hometown, school, favorite movies, sports, music), and my last agenda, unfriending ""friends"".

This was tougher than I thought. I had about 1,600+ friends and I never really thought about why I kept adding random people back then. Anyway it was a tedious process, but I managed to cut down all my friends from 1,600+ to just 647, which is still a lot, but considering how many people I had back then, this is big. I kept those that I know personally, and I have talked with at some point in my life, but for sure I will start unfriending those I haven't talked to in like over a year. 

Having that many people who can publicly view your personal life, or maybe talk to you really gave me anxiety and somewhat also put some pressure on me. I didn't know many of these people but here they are lurking around ready to stalk or judge me remotely (which is why I deleted my posts). And it's just liberating to be rid of all these people who probably don't even know I exist, so I just put them in my digital trash bag and got rid of them.

So like when I de-cluttered my room, de-cluttering my digital presence also gave me a sense of freedom. Knowing that I didn't actually lose anything, but instead I gained more peace for myself. And now I'm just left with myself and the people who matter the most to me. And I guess that's what counts, right?",minimalism,1617020405.0
Decide Once,"SO was reading a book recently called The Lazy Genius and one of the principles is called Decide Once.  I realized this is the basic principle I have been using in my minimalism journey this year but just didn't have a name for it.  Basically, the premise is to decide once on something to minimize decision fatigue throughout your day.  For instance, I have one type of pajamas pants I love and have 3 pairs.  They are my very favorite.  I now know that I don't buy anything other type of PJs.  When I catch myself mindlessly browsing at Target I can tell myself.  ""I've already decided I wear Hello Mello pajamas"" and there is no need to shop further.  Another examples is scrubs I have one specific type and brand I wear and when I ruined one by spilling bleach on it I knew exactly what to do.  Ordered another identical pair online because I've already decided one scrubs that work for me.  You get the idea....same for hand soap.  My days i spend at home always involve a long shirt with leggings...add a cardigan if it's cold. No pause about what to wear because I've decided. I've also decided I LOVE candles that bring my joy.  Anytime people ask for gift ideas I always say candles.  No pause or having to think through gift ideas and I always say candles.

"During the Texas ice storm, my wife and I lost everything.","We lived in an apartment, we were prepared for the electricity to go out and the water to be cut off. We packed a small go bag just in case with some food in it. 

I was laying on the floor, trying to game plan life.
Lost my job due to the pandemic, my mom only has so much time left (cancer), and struggling with depression. I heard my wife speak up in concern; there was the sound of water rushing through our walls. I then looked up to the ceiling and saw water pouring from the light fixtures, the bottom of the floor, the carpets swelling.
My wife began having a panic attack, I told her to ""grab the kids and go to the car"". I grab the go bag and tried to save anything I could, it wasn't very much at all. (We had just gotten married, so we had wedding gifts) just some food and medicine really. 

The fire sprinkler system bursted and flooded our apartment in 3 minutes. And just like that 10 years of hard work, buying items to chase a temporary happiness, All the things I couldn't like go of. 
Were just gone. 

When insurance paid, My wife and I made the decision to instead of buying new things (other than the essentials), we should truly invest in ourselves.
I just finished trade school, and we now have a savings to put toward our future. I never realized how much the things I owned truly owned me. We lost everything but we really were blessed with a fresh start.",minimalism,1617299083.0
DAE feel this sub is becoming a repetitive sub for self validation ?,"
Lately this sub feels like it‚Äôs been expanding in the
‚ÄòWhat should I do? /  is this minimalist? / is it ok to get rid of x ? 

Only you know what‚Äôs appropriate to yourself 

Be it 6 coats or 2 coats, if you need it or it‚Äôs used then keep it 

After practicing minimising for myself and my family It‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap of toxicity.

Someone who works from home in a 2 climate area, will require something completely different to someone who commutes and lives in 4 season area with micro climates when one day and the next can be completely different 

Someone might find joy in jackets, video games, books, art. It‚Äôs ok to keep that which brings you joy 

An objective view on minimalism is a breeding ground for toxicity. The minimalists are great for pointing people in the right direction, but comparing yourself to them in an effort to be more minimalist is not the way to go. 

Their business is selling people the idea of minimalism. It‚Äôs how they make their money.

Coming back on topic, if you feel like getting rid of if then you can put it away for a specified period of time and check back in future 

The worst case scenario for most items is that you can buy them again easily, quickly or find alternatives. 

Self motivation and self regulation is the only way to go 

There‚Äôs no right or wrong.

Perhaps a minimalist lifestyle and a minimalist subreddit is required,  

if that‚Äôs ok and would still be minimalist üòâ

Did anyone else arrive at minimalism through environmentalism? And vice versa anti-consumerism?,"Seeing the way we plunder and pollute our planet made me not want to be a part of it and take an active role in stopping it. That led me to having fewer items overall and stopping my pleasure purchasing. Stopping impulse buying led me to view consumerism and capitalism (in the Western sense) as something quite unwise and arguably delusional. Not being driven to buy material goods has led me to not really seeing the futility in working for high net worth. Not being driven to work long hours for lots of money has led me into FIRE (financial independence retire early). 

All of this, where I‚Äôve ended up, is so far away from the society I was raised in and what I was taught to value. And what I was taught ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù is. Most people I meet can‚Äôt understand that I‚Äôm not driven by money.

How going blind turned me into a minimalist - the obstical is the way,"Hey guys!  I have a sorta weird journey I‚Äôd like to share.  

I learned in middle school that I was slowly going to go blind.  At the time I didn‚Äôt quite comprehend how that would change my life.   All I knew is my work life would be short.  

I started trying to make as much money as possible. I was terrified!  Felt like an impossible challenge.  

At age 23 as my eyes got worse  i sold my car and I started car pooling into work.  What a huge cost savings!  

I turned my license in at 26 (wasn‚Äôt really using it anyway)

As I lost more vision it got harder to play golf, play video games, mow the yard, clean a big house, ride a bike, etc.  all things I no longer need to buy.  Meanwhile I was still working saving as much as I could.  

Eventually I had to get the white cane, and I started running into more things... things I didn‚Äôt need.  The potted indoor tree, bulky entertainment stand, stuff in the garage I never used.  So I got rid of it!  

Then the day came... I needed to retire. My eyes had gotten to the point I couldn‚Äôt work.  I was way beyond legally blind.  I was 33

After a month I realized I lived in a high cost of living area for no reason, so I moved to an area that costs 1/2 as much bought a house and never looked back.  

I share my story because I feel like the luckiest person.  Going blind forced me to make so many hard decisions that many would think was crazy but ultimately open so many doors of opportunity like retiring early.  

I‚Äôm not a perfect minimalist but I can say it has changed my life!

It makes it harder to be more minimalist if I have to be constantly replacing things. I think the concept of 'buy cheap buy twice' generally rings true, but I don't always have the budget to buy the highest quality.

"""You Live In a Tiny Apartment.""","recently I needed a cable from IT to do remote work. When they asked how long I said ""My apartment is about as big as this room."" (The office we were in) and the person said ""You live in a tiny apartment."" 

I've been mulling that comment over and over in my head. Yes, I do live in a tiny apartment. And its wonderful. And it saves me hundreds of dollars each month. And I don't feel compelled to fill it with stuff. And it is quick to clean. And I can save huge percentage of my income for things that matter to me more than having two bathrooms. And the location is more convenient for someone who uses public transit than the suburbs. 

I feel as a minimalist we will sometimes get this ridicule. But it's important to remember that most people are on autopilot. Buying into the myth that more is better without realizing it's not always true. It's hard to go against the crowd  sometimes but it's vital to live a life true to your values.

Edit: thank you for your supportive comments. I see now I was a little too quick to assume ridicule. I just felt defensive. I appreciate your help correcting my mindset. I really do love my small apartment and it works for me, not that it works for everyone. I don't feel that I'm superior to anyone! I'm just different than the cultural narrative that is currently the norm and going with or against the group is always a source of conflict. I'm sure smarter people than I have articulated this point better.",minimalism,1622304006.0
"Minimalism should not be a contest of who has less, but a philosophy of less.","Hi everyone.

I have been on this subreddit for a while and I would like to bring up what minimalism means to me. I have read many posts about how some people have only 2 T-shirts and 5 pairs of socks. As I was reading this while looking into by wardrobe with much more T-shirts and socks I felt guilty for not being minimal enough. Then I realized it is not about ""who can survive on less"" , but rather to feel comfortable. I do laundry every approx. 2 weeks. If I would have less clothes I would need to do it much more often, which would lead to stressful situations and a lot of planning. Then I realized that for me, minimalism is not only about minimizing the number of stuff, but also about minimizing the amount of willpower and time spent on planning. This applies also to dishes: I used to live in a small flat where I had only 4 plates for 2 people. This is lovely, until you realize you can not use the dishwasher because of obvious reasons.......

So I would like to tell you that it is okay to have more stuff if that brings you less stressful situations and less planning for optimization with too little stuff. The threshold for this trade-off is different for everyone (e.g. if you are used to eat lunch at work and dinner outside, you do not need as much dishes as a person who cooks everything everyday). And also to think about the situations if something brokes, how fast do you need to replace it? If it can wait, then no problem to have less of such stuff. But if you will need it immediately and you would be forced to stand up and go to the store now, it might be very inconvinient. In this sense, I want to *minimize time spent about thinking and optimizing situations to survive on the ""expense"" of having a bit more stuff.*

I just wanted to add my point of view and maybe ensure some people who just start to be minimalists, to think what it means for them, before they throw away too much. Don't get me wrong, I do not want to say that having just 2 T-shirts is incorrect, I just want to stress out to adjusting the concept to your specific situation and needs, not just throw everything away because someone did so and is happy, so I have to be happy to. It is also okay to discuss points of view, ideas and give/take advice, just adapt it to yourself (as with everything in life...).

To sum up, I believe that the core idea of minimalism was to *de-clutter your life and make it more simple. Do not add complexity by pushing for the other extreme: of having too little. The idea which we want to optimize should be to minimize complexity, maximize utility and happiness by simplifying things*, whatever that means for you.

Have a lovely day and think for yourself :)",minimalism,1622370595.0
Why is minimalism so white?

Is there any place i can find less blank white minimalism? Something either more colorful or like any other aesthetic besides ""i live in a white box""?

Thank you all SO much for your kindness in this thread.

This post was inspired by another post a few days ago called,[""why is minimalism so white?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/nv4fuj/why_is_minimalism_so_white_and_where_can_i_find/)

I played house swap with my grandmother when I graduated college. She passed away last week, but for the last three years I've been living at her house, while she moved in with my parents. I grew my business here, had relationships here, lived a life near a major city. This has been home.

But the carpets are pink. There is flower pot patterned wallpaper in the kitchen. The stove is from the 60s (brown, and VERY cool I might add). This is not a minimalists house, yet I am a minimalist.

Over the years, I've decluttered this place. Removing junk - junk I was allowed to remove because it was nothing but junk. I threw out 13 trash bags of complete garbage from this house. I took all the photos covering the surfaces and put them neatly in a closet i did not use.

This house because pristine. When my parents would come visit, my dad who grew up here was astonished and said, ""I never knew how big this place was with all the shit that was everywhere.""

I was in a relationship with a girl who would really mock the fact that I was living here. She was pretty judgey, but made it known she did not like spending time here. It made me super self conscious about it, and embarrassed to talk about it. It is a privilege to be where I am.

After that relationship ended, I met another girl, and as always when I tell knew people I kinda prepare for cringe... this person said to me, ""Pink carpets!? That should be more popular. That's such a vibe.""

I felt like I could really breathe and be myself having been accepted by this. The purpose of this post was to say, you can be a minimalist, and not have ikea furniture. I have pink carpets, but every surface of this 3br house is completely cleared. Minus two photo books (One I shot, one my friend shot), one surface with my plants, and another surface with my knife rack. Every other surface is completely clean, and I can fit all my worldly possessions in the trunk of my sedan. I'm proud of where I spent three years, and wanted to share.",minimalism,1623636749.0

The more money I make the less I spend on things,"So I recently had a chat to a friend about how now that I'm older and my career is not bad i.e. make more money the less I'm spending on things. 

I remember when I was younger and obv making less money, I'll splurge on designer clothes, branded name things etc. But after 2 weeks I'd be poor af waiting for the next pay cycle.

I live in a cheap ass studio cos I'm just one person so I think having a bigger place seems excessive. When I was living in a 2 bedder joint I realised I never really used a lot of the space. I no longer buy expensive clothes or branded stuff, the clothes I do buy is usually from Uniqlo.

Most of my spending would be in travel and maybe the odd gadget like new phones or tech stuff but it's rare and only once in a blue moon.

I guess I find it funny cos now I can buy what I wanted before when I was younger but it no longer interests me. I get more excitement living without like having less things and see how I can get survive with the bare minimum.

"The trap of ""I'll just give it away if I don't like it"".","I've always considered myself pretty minimalistic. I had insecure housing as a teenager/young adult and being able to carry the essentials in a backpack made me feel a lot more secure (anyone else?). 

I started dating (and eventually moved in with) a man who- compared to me- is almost a hoarder. To be fair, he comes from a family of immigrants who store EVERYTHING until it can be sold/bartered/whatever, no matter how small.

He always ""needed"" more and more things. More clothes. Electronics. Household goods (can't do dishes without *special* dish gloves, can we??). And of course, over the years, I started to give in. I hated having clutter everywhere and feeling like he needed to fill every square foot of space with *something*. We had to live in LA for his career and I hated that whenever we had to move we had to find a bigger place to accomodate all of his things. I thought of it as paying beachfront rent for a storage unit- a huge waste. But eventually I started to think, ""oh well, if we don't use it then I can always give it away."" It was easier than fighting with him about it. 

We broke up recently he moved out of the apartment a few days before I did. So I told him to take what he wants and leave what he doesn't and I'll take care of donating it. 

Holy shit you guys. Not only did he pack up almost the entire apartment *because it was all his crap* but even *after* moving out I swear there was a metric ton of stupid stuff for me to donate. And you think when you're buying stuff that *someone* will want your stupid crap later but guess what! They usually don't. I had to make several trips to drop off clothes at the homeless shelter, canned goods at the food bank, and books at the library. The rest was thrown out. Just because you paid $100 for an ipod in 2007 doesn't mean anyone gives a shit about it now. 

When he came over and saw the little pile of things I had, he said ""I feel so bad that you have so little, it's like you don't have a life anywhere."" Tf?!? I'm so happy lol. I had a few GREAT pieces of furniture that I dropped off at my mom's for the time being and now it's just a few things and my bed in our old apartment. For the first time the windows aren't obstructed by anything and the sun streams in in the morning and I LOVE it.

JOMO = Joy of Missing Out,"I've been watching a lot of Simple Happy Zen on youtube lately and she talks about a concept opposite of FOMO (fear of missing out) which is JOMO (joy of missing out)!

I just thought this was brilliant when I first heard it and it's reframed a lot of the ways I look at things, such as:

* Shopping: you might experience FOMO if you pass up the opportunity to buy something, but what about the joy of having one less thing in your home, and having space instead?
* Tasks: The ""slow living"" approach to life might reduce the number of tasks you do in a day as you approach them more intentionally and mindfully. Even sitting around quietly and enjoying doing ""nothing"" instead of trying to be 100% productive all the time can bring a lot of joy... that's the joy of missing out.
* Events: If something's happening socially and you simply don't want/need to attend, don't worry about what you're missing... enjoy the mental peace and clarity that can come with staying at home instead.
* Information: If you decrease time spent reading news or watching videos or TV, then you'll be taking in less information. But what is that info really doing for you? If you could devote more quality energy to one show at a time, reading a book, talking directly to friends etc, you can experience the benefits of focusing on one thing instead of many.

Space (physical, mental, and emotional) is often more joyful than objects or events that might otherwise fill it.",minimalism,1626201351.0
Off my chest: I was robbed and it's okay.,"My apartment was robbed and they walked off with a huge chunk of my belongings. Not just the obvious TV and stereo and jewellery; they took old parts computers and half-used bubble bath and paintings off the walls.  
My way of dealing with this has been to go room-by-room and move everything out, then does-this-spark-joy everything back in piece by piece. I had done two big whole-apartment clean outs in the last few years, but this one has been the most ruthless. I'm liking my new, more minimalist living arrangement. I even crossed the threshold and got rid of my bed, having been sleeping in a hammock full-time for the last six months or so. So much more floor space!A lot of stuff I considered sentimental, I don't even miss.

I don't even really want the cops to catch the guys who did it, because I'm looking forward to the compensation money and most of the stuff that was stolen I don't ever want to see again.

Here's the off-my-chest part; I'm sure my neighbour knows more than they're saying, being either part responsible or at least complicit. I haven't let on that I know this, and I'm always cheery and nice. But they've seen me carrying junk out of my place and asked if they could have it, so now we have a system where I leave stuff outside their door before throwing it out. It gives me a wry sense of satisfaction to think that I'm loading them down with useless crap whilst lightening my own load.

"Why is everyone in US cities obsessed with goals and grind? There is nothing wrong with your goal being to play video games, or live off a home-farm.","Title. It seems to me everyone around me aged 25+ is so obsessed with just giving more of their time to a corporation or only caring about what their income is. I work in retail management and I sometimes tell people I don't know if I even want to move up, I want time to be able to play the new Metroid game on the switch. Replay pokemon games. Go on a random trip to a car show 4 hours away.

My goal in life is NOT give a company 40 years of service until i die. Even my parents all they do is work, get home to sit on the couch to watch netflix....and they tell me how I need to be more ambitious at work.

I'm ambitious at life! I've traveled across the world to asia, europe, north america. I've worked in Hong Kong with a totally different culture and met people I will never meet in the US. 

I live minimally so that any full-time minimum wage job would still pay enough for me to live in NY. No need to stress about climbing the ladder.

At this point the only use I see in climbing any ladder is to be able to save more so I can quit working even sooner.

But Im the one that lacks ambition because it isn't to devote my life to a company that doesn't care for me and only have free time once I'm too old to do anything.

No thanks. Minimalism has opened my eyes to what I really need. It isn't a house with 3 extra rooms I don't need. It isn't an expensive car that just came out that will lose 50% of its value in the first 3 years and works just as well as a good condition car that costs less than 20k.

Edit: I'm not saying that hobbies can't be physically demanding. But when we do hobbies it is out of desire not necessity so we can do it when we want to.

Edit edit: thank you all for so many responses I can't keep up. So many of you are giving great feedback. Many of you enjoy your jobs and that is awesome! I do hope that we can get to a point where people can do what they want without disrespect even if it doesn't matchup exactly with what the norm is. For now I'm just saving and investing a good chunk of my income. Hopefully someday to have a good financial buffer.",minimalism,1627447220.0

I think minimalism is going to get really popular and capitalism is going to have to adjust for it.,"Long read, but you might like it!

Tiny homes, container homes, van dwelling, off-gridding, homesteading, minimalism, over-landing, seasonal work, etc.

All of these things are getting more and more popular, communities for these sorts of things are growing a lot more than past years.

I think Covid really opened people‚Äôs eyes to how callous and indifferent capitalism really is to the world and the workers who keep it afloat.

Companies don‚Äôt care about you. If you quit your job you would be replaced quickly.

Couple that fact with the idea of ‚ÄúWhat exactly are you working for?‚Äù

To have a roof under your head, food to eat, money to pay for bills, debt, spouse, children, etc?

Why exactly does that require 40-60+ hour work weeks for a lot of people?


A lot of it has to do with consumerism and the idea that there is never enough. You‚Äôre not meant to live within your means and maintain your lifestyle, you‚Äôre meant to grow your lifestyle, gain more and more.

And that leads to entrapment.

Despite what your income is: 20k, 50k, 80k, 100k, 500k, 1000k a year.

The system is designed to entrap you.

Majority of people buy houses on 15-30 year fixed mortgage rates.

That is 15-30 YEARS of your time, energy, and money paying that off.

Can you comprehend that? 

That means by the time you buy your first house in say your late 20s you would already be close to if not middle-aged by the time you pay it off.

It‚Äôs all about entrapment,

What can society do to make you consistently abide and profit the system?

It can push the narrative of marrying and having kids which equates to a life long commitment of providing for that family which in turn equates to profiting the system. 
(No offense to those that have kids, but this is true.)

It can push things like the ‚Äúcollege standard‚Äù, which funnels people into debt and jobs that require specific skill sets, but almost all profit big companies like tech, healthcare industry, and business.

Making ‚Äúbig money‚Äù, but entrapping workers and almost making it mandatory to live certain lifestyles because you have a certain profession. Think doctor or lawyer and nice cars and houses.

But another key component to this is the fact that trade or vocational schooling is severely undermined and thought of as ‚Äúshop class‚Äù people careers.

But in reality provide hands on training and education at an immensely cheaper price than college with guaranteed work upon completion.

I‚Äôve also noticed that practical skills like building a house, fixing plumbing, fixing your car, etc, are not often enough valued in the education system, especially colleges.

And I believe there is a reason for that.

This is all subjective of course, but hear me out.

I‚Äôve worked in a few trades for the majority of my life, and the one thing I‚Äôve noticed about any expensive place I‚Äôve worked at, whether it be some wealthy family or business man‚Äôs 5 star rental on the coast, they all shared the same thing.

They have no practical skills. All their time and work is dedicated to their college learned skillset. They will have 5 different contractors working on their house doing 5 different things. Fixing leaks, adding a bedroom, cutting their lawn, etc.

I think colleges and the education system does this on purpose, because it keeps people less independent and less inclined to not follow the system.

If they just pay for services instead of doing it themselves, that keeps money flowing, that keeps them within the system.

Schools don‚Äôt teach kids how to manage money properly, do their taxes, how loans work, etc.

People learn that when they‚Äôre out on their own and a lot of the time they get cheated with a high interest rate loan or something where they didn‚Äôt know better, but that‚Äôs what society wants.

The second a person learns how to build their own house, fix their own car, manage money wisely, be self motivated, etc they become extremely dangerous to the system. That‚Äôs exactly why I think entrepreneurship is heavily frowned upon and thought of as a unobtainable dream.

If everyone was like that the system of capitalism would not work.

But now we dive into the big game changer.

Minimalism.

Now more and more people are realizing that you can play along with the system‚Äôs rules and still manage to break free from entrapment.

By eliminating things like expensive houses, cars, eating habits, spending habits, etc‚Ä¶

You greatly minimize the time it takes to reach the level of financial independence.

People work and live in vans saving enough money to just travel for a year and go back to work when necessary.

People live at home with their parents and save bundles upon bundles of money until they can move out and buy some off grid cabin or tiny home completely paid off.

People hop from state to state or country to country doing seasonal work for free housing and experience.

Now more than ever we are seeing people combat the system, and it‚Äôs only getting bigger and bigger every day.

A lot of it has to do with people realizing that consumerism really isn‚Äôt a healthy standard of living and they would rather live modestly to enrich themselves in experiences and things they want to do.

Another part of it is people have no choice and have to do these things because everything is so expensive right now.

Regardless I hope people understand that in the end minimalism is going to change the world.

People and companies can talk about global warming and going green and all of that as much as they want, but the real problem is at the heart of capitalism.

We consume and waste far more than we need to, couple that with the world population increasing dramatically everyday and that‚Äôs why the world is the way it is.

The less people want and the less they spend leads to deflation.

Which leads to companies polluting less, manufacturing and wasting less, and ultimately restructuring their outlook on marketing and profit.

I think this all is coming sooner than we may think.

I think when people realize that being rich and owning more and more just leads to more entrapment, they‚Äôre going to value financial independence and their own desires a lot more.

Minimalism will change the world, whether we choose to or capitalism leads us so far down that it‚Äôs coming whether people like it or not.",minimalism,1630190483.0
Smugness here is at an all-time high.,"I've been on the sub a while, and I haven't yet seen many posts bashing non-minimalists. But for the past couple of weeks I've seen several.

Your minimalism is a path to make you happy. It is not a way for you to feel superior to others. Also, let's not pretend that we ""Don't understand"" people who believe that they get joy from owning and buying things. Almost none of us were born minimalists, so at some point we all were that way too.

If part of the point of this is to help you clear your mind and develop a more internal sense of peace, why are you filling your head with judgments and concerning yourself with the decisions of others?",minimalism,1632403179.0
Been practising minimalism for 5 years and I‚Äôm regretting some of the things I did,"I regret throwing my vinyl records. I collected a lot of it pre-minimalism. But after reading about minimalism and reflecting on it, I made the decision to de clutter and sold everything away. It was a liberating experience. Along with other acts of minimalism, my life has been amazing since I made the change 5 years ago. I‚Äôve stopped caring about what other people think, what the world wants me to be, and just fully focused on what matters to me. However, i don‚Äôt feel joy in some of the activities that i used to enjoy doing and I‚Äôm starting to understand what ‚Äòvalue‚Äô truly means for me. 

You see when I made the decision to sell all my vinyl records, the rationale was that listening to Spotify holds more ‚Äòvalue‚Äô. It‚Äôs cheaper, I can listen to it anytime, anywhere and almost anything that I want. My vinyl records however was taking up too much space, some were collecting dust and I was spending too much money and effort into it. Once I cleared it all up, I have more space in my room, I stop thinking about which next record to buy and that gave me more attention to put into my work as a software engineer. 

All was good until this year, I realised that my relationship with music has changed. To me they all sound the same and the act of listening to music was ‚Äòboring‚Äô. But how could this be? I had access to millions of music as compared to the 50 vinyl records I used to own, and I can listen to it anywhere and whenever I want. I should be happy, right? And that‚Äôs where the problem lies. Overabundance. In quantity and accessibility. In my attempt to make a more ‚Äòminimalist‚Äô choice, it backfired. I started listening to songs that I previously would never have chosen to listen too, simply because I‚Äôm bored and Spotify is recommending me to. 

I tried limiting my use of Spotify, and allowing myself
to only listen to music on a specific time block when I‚Äôm at home. But the experience isn‚Äôt the same, I hate having to use more willpower and attention to stop myself from listening to music during the day when it‚Äôs is easily accessible to me, be it Spotify or YouTube. 

And so with this I realised that minimalism is not just about throwing stuff away, it‚Äôs really about the value of your attention and where you‚Äôre putting it into. It‚Äôs possible to have a messy, uncluttered space as long as it gives you the value to fully focus on a particular activity that you enjoy.",minimalism,1632760412.0

Normalize doing less: the Anti-New Years Resolution,"Most New Years Resolutions are all about adding things to you plate, buying stuff, and working more; going to the gym, eating better, writing that great American novel...

Even when you are technically removing things from your life (like drinking less), it's constructed in our minds to be more work. All this added effort in our already overwhelmed lives is setting us up for failure.

So if you are going to do a resolution this year: do less.

Let's go back to the Less Drinking example. Yes, it's doing less. But it's written in a way that makes it active. You are thinking of it as working to stop something. Instead maybe try something like, ""I'm done with the partying time in my life"" or ""I'm done going to clubs and wasting money"" 

I know this isn't perfect in every example. But look at the trope about Going to the Gym. Most people will fail within the month, because they are just adding another goddamn thing to do each day. It's also too big and undefinable.

So what then can you take out of your life, that would allow you to have the mental and physical bandwidth to go to a gym? Start there.

My family was amazing with minimalist Christmas gifts,"My non-minimalist family rocked minimalist Christmas gifts this year. Since all their ideas are outside of the usual advice about gift certificates, experiences, and food, I figured I'd share them as inspiration.

**My aunt** **made me a very detailed family tree**. She researched both her side of the family and my mom's side. It goes back to the 1600s and must have taken her an eternity to put together (she's retired and said it was her lockdown project). She also brought a lot of supporting documents with her to my parents' house, including my great-grandma's diary from WWI-era Germany. This project inspired my dad to get out the old family photographs he had, and we were able to add a lot of detail, like what professions people had, and match photos to names.

**My dad** **paid for a tent I'd already bought.** In September, he heard me gushing about this amazing backpacking tent I'd just bought myself and said ""Can I get you that as a Christmas present?"" To put it under the tree for Christmas morning, he made a little tent out of paper, and wrapped that in a box with a check for what the tent cost.

Technically, the tent is from both of my parents, but my mom is the kind of person who really likes to give physical presents. She also got me a beautiful basket from a local artist that I love and some coasters that I don't. The best part about her gift is that she volunteered, ""If you don't think this stuff matches your decor, I won't be offended if you leave it here."" Thanks for the basket, and enjoy your new coasters, mom!

For stocking stuffers, ""Santa"" (= mom) gave me useful consumables, including **hand sanitizer** and **a COVID test.**

Bonus win: **My dad asked for a photo scanner for Christmas.** My parents are getting up there in age, and my mom has 35 photo albums. She didn't want to leave me thousands of family photos to sort through while grieving. In the days after Christmas, my dad had everybody go through all the albums and put a sticker next to photos they want digital copies of. He's going to scan the photos we actually care about and put them in the cloud. Then, my mom's going to put her 100 favorite prints into one album and toss the rest.

I feel so lucky that my family actually listens to me about not wanting lots of stuff, and so impressed with their creativity in giving me such awesome and meaningful gifts.",minimalism,1641129567.0
Anyone else drawn to minimalism for ease of cleaning?,"I am still working on becoming more minimalist, but one thing that really draws me to it is that it‚Äôs so much easier to keep things clean and tidy. I was looking at some photos of maximalist spaces today, and they look so pretty and artistic, but how do you keep it all dusted? How do you not lose things? How many things do you have to move out of the way to vacuum? Etc. I like being able to clean everything easily and feel like I have to spend less time cleaning up.",minimalism,1642287428.0
On the bizarre way I‚Äôve seen people relate to minimalism around the sub,"It‚Äôs a minority of the people here to be sure, but is anybody else perplexed by questions of ‚Äúif I do or have X, can I still be **a minimalist**‚Äù, or ‚Äúdoes (common human value) matter to minimalists‚Äù? Or the guy asking ‚Äúis minimalism a life value‚Äù when the central issue is that he doesn‚Äôt support his wife and appears to fiercely and maybe even selfishly segment what are ‚Äúhis‚Äù duties at home?

I just want to remind people that minimalism isn‚Äôt a religion, or a club, or an identity. If being *‚ÄùA Minimalist‚Äù (as opposed to just ‚Äútrying to be minimalist‚Äù, or ‚Äútaking a minimalist approach‚Äù) is helpful to you, then sure, consider yourself A Minimalist.

But in the end, minimalism is just a tool that helps *you*. There aren‚Äôt any rules, nobody‚Äôs going to take away your minimalist card because you have a plushy collection you earnestly enjoy, or have more shoes than the average person.

Minimalism is just asking do you need those things, or would you be happier and more more contented if you had the space instead? What are you holding onto just because of feelings of emotional obligation that you might not have recognised before? Are you spending responsibly on your hobbies/interests, or are you bringing yourself to struggle? Is forever upgrading your shit filling (or failing to fill) a void in your life? Does the stuff in your home, bag, work desk fill a purpose or spark joy, or does it only contribute clutter to your mental space as well as your physical space?

Minimalism is about a more mindful, more fulfilled you, or else what‚Äôs the point in it? I know for a lot of us trying to be minimalist ties with anti-consumption, which might also be linked to saving money or lessening our environmental impacts by buying less. Even still, minimalism is just a tool to help you consider these things.

I don‚Äôt make this post to shade anyone (except maybe *dressing-up-my-relationship-issues-as-‚Äúarent-I-a-good-minimalist‚Äù* guy‚Ä¶I side-eye you, dude) but if you get hung up about doing minimalism ‚Äúthe right way‚Äù or hitting a certain ‚Äústandard‚Äù of minimalism, then you‚Äôve already defeated the purpose because minimalism has just become another source of junk and worry in your life.

I made $100 selling my belongings at a yard sale. It wasn‚Äôt worth it.,"I began decluttering as a first step towards minimalism. But I got a little greedy thinking I could make some money off of selling my things in a neighborhood yard sale. And also feel less guilty about acquiring all this stuff. I spent the whole evening in a mad rush beforehand gathering, pricing and preparing. The next day was 5 hours of haggling with strangers over prices. The money was just not worth the irritation. And seeing all the stuff that would probably end up in a landfill was a little depressing tbh. I could have spent that time playing with my son, hanging with friends, choosing self care or really just anything else that didn‚Äôt put focus on ‚Äúthings‚Äù.

And if someone doesn‚Äôt find those things, they‚Äôll just wind up in a landfill. It hit me that I need to be even more careful about what I bring into the house, and also I should start selling the things that are worth money and save it for experiences.

I finally deleted all my social media accounts as well as apps including Netflix.," I have struggled with my mental health for a long time and being on social media was not helping at all. I used to run a small art account with more than 10 K followers. In the beginning I used to create art as a hobby but then the pressure from people to constantly create content arose. It made me feel suffocating cos I started this account as an escape from my busy work life. However a few months later I started feeling as if this account was no different from a boring job. Also the constant updates from friends and families travelling around the world didn‚Äôt make it easy. It was not that I was jealous , It was just that I felt my life was not exciting enough. In the beginning I deleted facebook around six months ago, then I disappeared from Instagram almost two months back along with twitter as well as tumblr. I still use reddit but just to read interesting questions. I don‚Äôt follow people here neither I chat with anyone. This decision has been very peaceful for me overall. Firstly I am not frustrated with my own life constantly and secondly I am sleeping well. I have also started reading books plus started trading as well as investing. Everything in my life is finally back on track both mentally and financially. Now am earning twice more than before. I am having amazing time with my husband too. Plus the mystery regarding my personal life is kind of getting rid of my haters who were constantly poking their noses in my business before. I have also deleted netflix cos I don‚Äôt want to waste anymore money on it cos binge watching was not helping at all. I am never going back to social media again.

Wear your ‚ÄúBest Outfit‚Äù when clothes shopping,"I'm on a low-buy year, but I do occasionally have to purchase or replace clothing items. One trick I've been using is to wear a really great or favorite outfit when I go shopping. 

This allows me to easily compare how the new clothing item looks, feels and fits. If it's not up to the standard of my favorite outfit, it's easy to say no. 

I did this recently when I needed to replace a dress that was my go-to nice/more formal outfit. I wore it to the store, and basically it became a game...  Dress vs. Dress! Find a new dress that can beat the old one! Ask yourself, would you be willing to leave behind the old clothing item and only take the new one home? 

It really helps me get into the right mindset when shopping. Plus, it can help if you have a tendency to just buy for the sake of novelty and then have a closet full of clothes you never wear. This trick is helping me avoid falling back into those bad habits.",minimalism,1653743866.0

Watching people pretend to be rich is so embarassing,"So much of consumerism is just people pretending to be richer than they are. It's sad that they feel pressured to, and that's its own topic, but at the same time watching someone spend their entire covid relief cheque on a Gucci purse just gives me such strong secondhand embarrassment. There are ENTIRE BRANDS that seem to be dedicated to this.

Take Guess for example - purses with big fat logos telling everyone that you own a Guess bag, stores that make you feel the way you *imagine you'd feel* if you were richer than you actually are for a brief moment. Staff wearing suits, treating you like gold, walking around the counter to grace you with your bag after purchase. Ohh la la. I don't think I've ever seen a single wealthy (or even slightly above average income) person walk around with The Big G, and yet every single person ever who has proudly strutted around with a Guess bag seemed to genuinely believe that they've fooled everyone else into thinking their last name is Gates. I have nothing personally against these people but I just cringe so hard when I see someone with a t-shirt that looks like Gap but says ""Gucci"" in really worn-out print, or carrying a purse that probably cost them more than the car they're driving it around in.

Minimalists aren't immune to this - for example there's a subset of people that almost seem to use minimalism as an excuse to buy every. single. apple. product. They mention ""my apple watch"" and display their macbooks on pictures as though it's the key to being minimalist yet also letting people know that they can afford a top of the line macbook with all the bells and whistles. Again, there's nothing wrong with anyone owning a macbook - I actually think apple products have some nice under-the-hood features that nobody else has - but watching people buy it because they think it will get them the same effect as wearing Gucci with the suave subtly of ""rejecting consumerism"" is just too much.

Moving houses really is really enlightening in seeing how much stuff one has,"Me and my partner are moving to a different apartment, and as we're actively trying to downsize our possessions, we decided to go through everything we own and let go of everything we don't use. A while ago, we decided to go through the kitchen cupboards. We deliberately let the dishes pile up before this - as those things would obviously be things that we regularly use - and simply emptied out the entire cupboards.

 We established rules before starting to go through the things - everything that hadn't been used once since our last move had to go. Things that have only been used once are spared if either of us can name the exact time, place or situation *when* we will need them. And if there's a spare of something we already *do* use, we'll pick whichever one is in better condition, used more, or simply prettier, and donate the one that we like less.

 And let me tell you, our cupboards are *empty*. Why in the world would *two* people need *four* frying pans? Why were we still using the broken cutting board when we have three whole ones?

Minimalism allowed me to save my cat's life,"My cat recently got very sick - one minute he was fine, we were playing, and all was okay. An hour later he was hiding in the closet, and had vomited far more liquid than I knew he could have in his body: leading to me rushing him to the ER. He is okay now, he is resting at home, and I have never been more grateful for anything in my life. On a smaller note, I am also grateful to minimalism - I don't know if I could've helped him otherwise.

1) I took a work-from-home job for a small paycut in the interest of minimalizing my worklife, so I was here when he got sick. At my prior job I wouldn't have been home for another 8 hours - I don't think he could've lasted another 8 hours.

2) We own very little excess, and the excess is hidden behind closed doors where he cannot get to them. Not having this excess made it easy to rule out injesting any poisonous objects, plastic, or sharp objects: leading to the vet knowing what to look for.

3) I'm fairly anti-consumption. Because of this I repair what I can, and buy as little as I can - taking stuff back when I slip up. This leads to thousands of dollars saved over the last couple years which I kept in my saving account. These savings were enough to pay for his sudden several thousand dollar surgery.

4) I have little value attached to what excess I have in my home, and so while he was having surgery and recovering at the hospital I pulled it all out, and listed it on various selling apps. This will help me begin to rebuild my savings. The items belonging to my fantasy self? Gone. The items belonging to my past self but have no relevance to me now? Gone. Random decor that is ""ok"" but not great? Gone. The old laptop I keep ""just in case"" my current, new one dies? Gone.
5. I see money as a tool now, not something with inherent value. There was no question about whether or not I'd pay to help my boy- I had the savings, I have a stable income, why wouldn't I? There is no pain from the money gone, because money is just a tool. There is just gratitude that I had the right tools to bring my boy home.

I hate cleaning but I desperately need things to be clean. Minimalism is the only answer.,"I used to be a shopping addict. I always felt like I could buy myself out of my mental health problems, whether it's a new hobby, a new wardrobe, a new organization system, or some promising cleaning gadget. I always felt like I was ""that one perfect thing"" away from being normal. A good person. My perfect self.

But then I discovered minimalism a few years ago, and it truly changed my life. Maybe even saved my life. I recognize that, while I'm not a naturally clean person, I have to have things clean to be mentally stable. If my environment is messy, I slide into the worst version of myself in almost every aspect of my life: my health, my finances, my productivity, my habits, and my effectiveness at work and in my relationships. It all stems from my environment. 

But I don't like cleaning. I don't like scrubbing floors, and washing endless dishes, and dust, and always picking up clutter. So much clutter! 

The only solution, at least, for me, is minimalism. It's having as little as possible in order to live comfortably and not one item more. It's not keeping around a bunch of aspirational clothing and crafting supplies and junk that reflects who I *wish* to be, and not who I actually am. It's infinitely easier to keep a sparse house clean than it is to constantly be shuffling, jumbling, and managing endless piles and piles of *stuff.* 

I'm definitely not perfect and still have to do a fair amount of cleaning each day, but my life has improved remarkably over the last 5 years or so, and much of that is thanks to minimalism.",minimalism,1664900799.0

How many of you use Minimalism as a sort of ‚Äòopting out‚Äô of a severely sick society?,"  I‚Äôm a 29 year old male who works in a factory. It‚Äôs a union gig, pays decent, I‚Äôm single, no kids, no wife, no home, just a little mini studio apartment that provides for all my needs. I get by. 
  I started practicing minimalism almost before I even knew what it was exactly (though from one minimalist to another, the definition and how it‚Äôs applied will vary) by simply reading more books on philosophy and questioning life more deeply in my early 20s.
  At some point, I just kind of realized there is almost nothing truly needed that money get you outside of food, shelter, a vehicle, and some of the basics of modern life like internet, phone, etc.
  I realized that money (to me) is useful only in such that it gives one freedom to do what they want when they want, essentially to not be a slave. Over the years I have just completely opted out of buying much of anything except for the necessities (food is my guilty splurge I guess). 
  I realized the probability of me being rich isn‚Äôt very high, but I can feel rich if my expenses are extremely low, or so low to the point where it isn‚Äôt effecting my quality of life too much.
  I wear plain fitted black t shirts that I buy by the dozen, they look great and can be worn casually or in the gym. I have like 1 good paid of sneakers and a pair of boots, and a few pairs of slim fitted black jeans. Basically just rotate through these.
  I wonder how many people found minimalism and the lifestyle of simplicity as a way to healthily cope with the current climate of the modern world?
  I recently read a book on people who live to be 100 and what their lifestyles are like in Japan vs USA, and they are VERY simplistic, very true to our roots as a species. Tight communities, not overeating, daily movement and time in nature, not overworked or over stressed by work. To me, looking at our ancestors as traveling bands of hunter gatherers I ask myself what more do I really need materially, or that money can buy, if for millions of years our ancestors lived out happy fulfilling lifes in one form or another without almost owning a thing, unless they could carry it.
  I‚Äôm really trying to cultivate that lifestyle and mindset of gratitude without comparing my way of living to the average modern man because I believe it is our natural way of living. Unfortunately it does feel isolating and I do feel the pressure to do and be more though I don‚Äôt believe that this is natural but rather a cultural conditioning to keep consuming and pursuing endless growth despite its futility.
  I have a bed, a hot shower, a roof over my head in a safe area, I can control the temperature - materially, what else does one require? I don‚Äôt want to keep ‚Äúupgrading‚Äù my lifestyle while chasing more money which inevitably leads to more stress and not much more happiness, though, like I said, I do feel isolated at times..",minimalism,1665938676.0
"After 20 years as a minimalist, I‚Äôm shifting to an essentialism.","I‚Äôve loved being a minimalist. It‚Äôs been especially helpful being an expat for the past 10 years. 

I got married this year and just started a year-long global backpacking journey with my wife. 

My wife is not a minimalist. As we started preparing for our trip, I found communicating minimalism somewhat difficult. 

As we packed, I started asking my wife, ‚Äúis this essential?‚Äù I found that this question opened and personalized minimalist concepts, which also made it easier to understand. 

At times, I‚Äôve found minimalism to be challenging for others to accept as it can come across as extreme and some can feel judged. However, as I consider what‚Äôs essential to each individual, I‚Äôve found a gentle way to move others in a direction that accepts and appreciates their individual needs and preferences. 

I want to encourage more people to lighten the loads in their lives. I believe this slight label change can open even more conversations while providing a super simple framework to follow.

5 years ago, i used my laptop daily. I couldn't imagine not having my laptop for a week. Phone for me was nice gadget, but nothing special. It wasn't smooth, battery life was horrible in every cheaper phone than flagships, internal memory and SD cards was expensive as fuck (and most phones didn't supported bigger SDs than 64 GB), websites wasn't really optimalised for smartphones, cameras with Minecraft quality in everything except flagships, shitty displays. I used phone only for Google authenticator, alarm and Facebook messenger. Android was just fancy Symbian without buttons. 

Now i don't even start my laptop for weeks if i don't need to. I am on dopamine detox till Christmas, so i don't even play games right now. Only thing i do on laptop are homeworks, studying and playing games. I even watch Netflix on phone because displays are great and its portable. It doesn't matter if i am in bed or in a train. Either way, its comfortable. If you add true wireless headphones, you reached maximum comfort. You don't even need to have powerbank, battery life is far better than was 5 years ago. 

Its silly in year 2022 discard smartphones in name of minimalism. Do social media disturb you? Uninstall them and use them only on browser or don't use them at all. Do notifications make you crazy? Turn them off or make them silent. Smartphones (at least the android ones) are manageable. With good management using smartphone have no downsides. Just imagine your desk: no paper calendar, no laptop, no mouse, no cables, not more than one notebook, only few most important sticky notes... Everything in your 6 inch brick.

"Instead of immediately buying online, add the item to a list that you review end of the month to reduce impulsive purchases","Between autofill, free shipping, PayPal, one-step checkout, and more friction reducing services, it‚Äôs easier and faster than ever to purchase items online. You don‚Äôt even have to pull out your credit card or type in your name and address. Keep in mind that websites are designed by a team of coders, data scientists, designers, and psychologists to entice you to fulfill the transaction immediately. This leads to a lot of unnecessary purchases that clutter your home, reduce your bank account, and add minimal value to your life.

Instead of purchasing an item you want, create a wishlist on your phone of items you think you need or want. You can add anything to it: clothing, household items, etc. When you feel the desire to acquire the item, add it to the list rather than the shopping cart.

At the end of each month, you‚Äôre allowed to buy any and everything review your list: no restrictions whatsoever.

What you‚Äôll likely find is that most items in the list are no longer desirable, thus reducing clutter and unnecessary spending. This has been extremely helpful in both my minimalism journey and building up greater discipline around consumption.",minimalism,1670486331.0

My mom took us on a shopping spree and I walked away with nothing,"I 31F have two sisters. They and my mom came to visit over Christmas and wanted to go to two specific stores that were having sales. I had fun driving them there and showing them the city. 

At each store, my mom said she would buy us anything we wanted, no limit. My sisters went insane. One of them got three pairs of shoes. They had to have spent close to a grand between the two of them. 

I walked away with literally nothing. My mom kept asking if I saw anything I wanted, kept pointing things out I might like, and I kept saying no thank you. 

The thing is, I wasn‚Äôt even being super disciplined about it. I truly did not want anything. I would have felt worse buying something and going home to put it in my closet than to just walk out empty handed. I feel like minimalism is really becoming easy for me. The thought of coming home with the amount of stuff my sisters got makes me nauseous. And the fact someone offers to get me anything I want for free and I can happily say no makes me feel like a successful minimalist.

EDIT: I made a well-thought-out Christmas list and my mom bought everything on it. She was thrilled to give, I was thrilled to receive. High dollar items. This shopping spree was an impulsive decision, once we got to the store and realized there was a big sale. My family is such a sucker for sales. They buy stuff they don‚Äôt need, because it‚Äôs on sale or a really good deal. We had a stackable discount at one store that got us like 75% off. I promise I let my mom buy me things, I just didn‚Äôt want to take part in the impulsive stockpiling.

Multiple days of clearing out my grandparents apartment has given me renewed belief in the value of minimising.,"
I don‚Äôt know what I wanted to discuss with this post, I think I just needed a place to record my jumble of thoughts from an emotional week.  

My sole remaining grandparent (late 90s) has gone into the kind of care you don‚Äôt come home from. Two aunts, an uncle, my mother and myself just spent days upon days sorting and clearing out their two bedroom apartment. 

It‚Äôd been clear for sometime that they had more stuff than they could manage, but they wouldn‚Äôt allow anyone to even start helping. 

A few things stand out: 

24 big black trash bags of un-donateable clothes. Stained, worn, torn, mouldy, or all of the above. 

Enough Tupperware/plastic containers to service a family of 8. They lived alone and barely cooked. 

6 whisks and 4-5 of multiple other utensils. 

Shoes. So many shoes. I lost count after 50. Many stored in places that were beyond their reach and some I know they haven‚Äôt worn since before retirement 30 years previous. Maybe 4 pairs were able to be donated. 

Piles of broken items waiting to be fixed/mended/repurposed. They never got around to any of it - why would they when they already had multiple others of the same thing? But if anyone tried tossing the unusable items it was as if you‚Äôd suggested stealing the Crown Jewels. 

It was both sad and frustrating at the same time. For the first day it was difficult moving around because of boxes and bags. So many originally nice things that were beyond salvation because they‚Äôd been forgotten about in the back of a crammed full drawer or cupboard. 

As a result of this experience, I‚Äôve started the new year freshly motivated to continue practicing mindfulness and minimalism with stuff. 

I‚Äôve made good progress in the past but envisaging how many plastic bags would be needed to pack up my place and estimating how much of my stuff would realistically go in the trash‚Ä¶ well I‚Äôve still got a long way to go. Time to roll the sleeves up and have at it!

I‚Äôve also instigated a ‚Äòno-buy‚Äô year for 2023 - when something runs/wears out, I‚Äôm determined to really look at what I already own and to use alternatives instead of instantly getting something new. 

I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôll be posting a success story on Dec 31st, but at the very least I think it will be one of progress.

Had our We Don't Need All this Stuff moving sale yesterday and... valuable life lesson learned.,"Over the last 15-20 years, hubs and I fell into the trap of the Modern American Dream.  Bigger houses, more crap to fill them.  Over the last 10 years, we've gone from a 3600 sq foot home 'in town' to a 2800 sq ft home we built (across the road) on 32 acres.

It was crushing us.  I didn't want to part with all the stuff, and he had his own 'stuff' he didn't want to throw away/give away/ donate.  It was consuming our free time to keep it all clean, displayed, dusted, polished, the yard and flower beds and pool maintained and looking spotless.  We were losing ourselves under the weight of it all.

It felt right to put the house and land on the market 18 months ago.  It sold at the very end of the 6 month realtor contract.  We built a much smaller, more modest home on our land across the road, and three weekends ago, we moved in.  We vowed to keep only what we desperately loved and needed, and to sell/donate/give away/throw away what was left.

After parting out heirlooms to family and taking home what we wanted, then paring THAT down, and opening up our storage unit yesterday, we were left with a literal stock trailer of... stuff.

Goodwill 30 miles away was full up - they couldn't take anymore stuff.

Goodwill 60 miles away picked through it all, took the cream, left the rest.  We have 3/4 of a stock trailer to try to dispose of either by selling on FBMP or sending to a landfill.

Here is my point:  We were both pretty quiet on the drive home.  Hubs and I were considering the vast amount of absolute crap we'd accumulated in the last 20 years.  Not just our own crap, but stuff left behind by both sets of our grandparents that we thought we couldn't part with, but now realize we don't need, and no one wants.

Our lesson, now that we're trying to keep only the things we need and will use, is that we are living in an era of unprecedented availability of cheap goods we think we need to fill a space and are tempted to accumulate.  Some of it, for us, is the influence of our Great Depression era grandparents' and their tendency to never throw anything away, some of it is the influence of the modern world around us.

Either way, we learned our lesson.  We don't want our kids to have to try to figure out what to do with our own stuff 20, or 30 years down the road.  We don't want to try to keep and store and clean and maintain 'shit we'll never use' anymore.  We don't want a bunch of useless crap to display and keep dusted.

We're done.  We're over it.

We may not be going to a hard core minimalist style of living as I know some people here strive to achieve, but it's a helluva big step for us to go from clutter to *functional and easy to clean*.

I hope we never fall into that trap, ever again.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have a livestock trailer full of crap to try to figure out what to do with....

ETA: Judging from just how. much. crap. both Goodwills already had - we're not alone in trying to pare down the sheer volume of 'stuff'.

Why do some of you act like getting gifts is a crime against you?,"For real, some of you act like you‚Äôre constantly barraged with gifts; living out your own personal story of Sisyphus. Seems to be a spike in ""how do I deal with gifts"" posts. Being minimalist doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre minimal about solutions. 

1. Sell it. Maybe on Facebook Marketplace (they have a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let friends see‚Äù option). Or Ebay. 

2. Re-gift it. Congrats, now you don‚Äôt have to shop. Or now you have emergency gifts you can dip into. Or maybe there‚Äôs someone you know that could actually use it. Join your local Facebook ""buy nothing"" group.

3. Curb it. Write ""free"" and let it magically disappear in front of your house. This is closest step to the final option. IMO, best of all worlds. Someone gets to use it and it's the least effort. No posting on Facebook or letting it sit in your home waiting to be re-gifted.

4. The nuclear option: throw it away. I get it, options 1 and 2 (and 3 if you're paraplegic) can be exhausting and not worth the effort. I don't like killing sea turtles anymore than you but it can either be trash in your home or be trash in the landfill.

So what if you keep getting gifts you don‚Äôt want? Maybe your parents or friends keep giving you physical items? Well, as an adult, you can‚Ä¶

3. Tell them *exactly* what you want. It might take time to get it into their heads but keep telling them exactly what you want. One story: a couple told their parents to stop giving them physical gifts and give them the gift of babysitting. In other words, the grandparents would babysit their grandkids as a gift.

4. And if you keep getting physical gifts you don‚Äôt want (like you‚Äôre a vegan getting beef jerky all the time), just smile and accept it and use one the 4 solutions. I'm sure someone would happily scoop up free beef jerky on your local ""buy nothing"" group.

Some of you seem to be letting yourself fight this uphill battle which is not minimalist, I hope you realize. Humans like to give. It's in our nature. You can no more stop getting gifts than you can stop the weather.

And frankly, it's not only the physical gift but the emotional one, too. Someone took the effort to give you something because they care. Oh, the humanity.",minimalism,1685454931.0

Don't Let Reddit Kill 3rd Party Apps! /r/minimalism will be going dark from 12th June,"**What's going on?**

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app permanently inaccessible to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from Apollo to Reddit is Fun to Narwhal to BaconReader.

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface .

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

**What's the plan?**

On June 12th, many subreddits will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because we love Reddit, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.

The two-day blackout isn't the goal, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.

**What can you do?**

1. Complain. Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a support request: comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as this one, leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.
2. Spread the word. Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at /r/ModCoord.
3. Boycott and spread the word...to Reddit's competition! Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite non-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!
4. Don't be a jerk. As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.

I‚Äôm over buying gifts to be thrown away or donated.,"Update - I am done with my shopping and this is a few things I did for loved ones. 

- Universal Yum subscription with a paper map for friends with middle age kids. For 6 months they will get snacks from different regions and they can find it on the map as they try them.

- 3 month subscription to Atlas Coffee. They will receive 3 bags of coffee sustainably grown with info from the farm they received it from.

-6 month subscription to Harry‚Äôs Razors. They will get two shipments of their preferred razors and shaving cream in that time.

- I set up 7 college funds total that will automatically have $10 put in a month. Each child gets a card at Christmas letting them know they had $120 put into their accounts with the statement of how it grew. It was very scary reaching out to a few close friends who didn‚Äôt have college funds set up, but it was loved by everyone and they helped me with the information to legally set it up in their child‚Äôs name. 

-Air B&B rental for my in-laws to take a trip with us (within 2 hours of their house so it‚Äôs not a chore or they have to pay for flights/etc). We will spend the day hiking some paths and wrote out a card detailing the trip.

I decided I‚Äôm done. 

I always come home a few weeks before Holidays and we do ‚ÄúFakes-giving & Early Christmas‚Äù 

I made a visit to my sister with my 3 amazing nieces. We have a large family that gifts kids during the holidays -  the kids have everything they can need or want toys and clothing wise - and it‚Äôs all so overwhelming. The kids don‚Äôt even play with most of it - it‚Äôs just piled up everywhere. 

My other sister is begging my family to stop bringing her ‚Äúfamily heirlooms‚Äù - and they just won‚Äôt. I finally got her to admit that it stresses her out and we put anything she didn‚Äôt want in a bin and took a picture to offer the other family members. 

My extended family throws nothing away and ‚Äúcollects‚Äù everything - beanie babies, DVDs, lighters, cards, spoons‚Ä¶ everything. I can only imagine how different their retirements would be if they put that money into investing. 

Gifting in America has become insane. So I‚Äôm changing my ways. 

What I did to change: 
- I made college funds for each of my nieces, they get a monthly amount put in that is ‚Äúgifted‚Äù all at once at birthdays and Christmas. Breaks up the expense as well! 

- Took my sister to the store and told her she could fill the cart with household items and groceries for her and her husbands Christmas present. Laundry soap, paper towel, toilet paper, groceries, etc. She loved it! 

-Got my family to agree to a Christmas trip to see each other instead of exchanging gifts! Memories over plastic!

- Nephews go to Disney yearly with their parents so we get gift cards to offset the cost of their tickets or use for a meal/character dinings. 

I really hope this catches on to other family members!

Edited to correct nephews to nieces. My nephews have full college funds from their grandparents on the other side of their family. ",minimalism,1699719995.0

Holiday frustration,"My wife and I strive to be minimalists - late 50s empty nesters, share an EV, eat vegan, and generally try to gift each other experiences, not stuff. But we are hosting 14 family members for Christmas, including a 1 year-old granddaughter. We‚Äôve purchased way too much Chinese disposable plastic crap for her, and the very thought of the mountain of trash and torn wrapping paper we‚Äôll be producing on Christmas Day fills me with sadness. The trash cans are already overflowing and we‚Äôre still 2 days out. Not looking for a fix or advice, just venting and hoping I‚Äôm not the only one who feels like a complete hypocrite. 

Update:  Thank you all for your thoughtful comments and suggestions. My wife and I will need to sit and seriously discuss a plan for next Christmas. Happy holidays to all. üå≤ ",minimalism,1735002582.0
Minimalism Win,"2024 has been a huge win for me. Last December I got rid of 90% of my clothes. I kept about 3 shirts and 3 pants, I don‚Äôt miss anything. Laundry used to be the most painful chore, now it‚Äôs a quick fix that I do constantly. Getting rid of all my clothes might‚Äôve been the best decision of my life. Genuinely, nothing has given me so much space to breathe. It‚Äôs also helped me become so much more mindful with the clothes that I buy. Buying new clothes is a rare occasion, and I find the need for higher quality things now. My cheap t-shirts I‚Äôve been wearing all year have holes and are falling apart at the seams. I‚Äôm starting to value clothing that will last a long time. I don‚Äôt feel guilty for spending a lot on a pair of pants because I know I‚Äôll wear it at least twice a week for years. Getting dressed is so much less stressful. All of my clothes match so I can dress for the weather without sacrificing comfort or style. I feel so much less cluttered, so much cleaner, and so much myself. If you are looking for a sign to get rid of all your clothes, this is it! Do it!!

(PS, I had a friend who took a ton of my clothes and loves them more than I ever did. After that, I still had two jumbo trash bags filled with clothes to donate. And of course there are still pieces I‚Äôm slowing phasing out. It‚Äôs not perfect or finished, but it‚Äôs so much better!)",minimalism,1735010305.0
Refraining from Buying Excess Things During the Holidays,"Hi, so I am not necessarily ‚Äúon a minimalist journey‚Äù or anything like that, but I‚Äôve appreciated looking through this subreddit and seeing so many people share my values. I‚Äôve always had trouble with spending (especially when thrifting/or at estate sales‚Ä¶ oh lord) but recently I‚Äôve been trying to cut back. I guess I feel more acutely aware of what space I have now, and I know that buying a new shirt or pair of pants isn‚Äôt going to magically make me feel better about my life. It‚Äôs tough around this time of year (especially during Black Friday in the US) and during the Christmas/holiday season, but I think I‚Äôve done a pretty good job of not buying things I don‚Äôt absolutely need/have the exact use in mind for. I‚Äôm planning on cleaning out my room/closet sometime this week, which has been a long time coming. I‚Äôm excited to see how much I can get rid of, and I‚Äôm excited thinking about the new homes/owners it could all go to.

How did minimalism impact where you chose to live?,Currently residing in a midsize US city but I'm not happy here. I've lived here for 4 years in both the suburbs and now downtown. This city is one of the top tourist destinations and it's gotten very crowded and I just don't vibe with the environment.  My lease is up next month and I've considered moving back to my hometown (about an hour away) but truthfully I'd like to start somewhere new as there's not much opportunity there. I like the walkability of downtown areas but I do appreciate the quiet lifestyle of smaller towns. I'm not attached to my full time job here and I do have a bit of savings that I could live off of for a few months.

Wearing the same type of clothing for work every day.,"I‚Äôm quite basic when it comes to clothes, and wanted to get your thoughts on this. 
I‚Äôm a secondary school teacher and love the idea of wearing one style of clothing all year. For summer white shirts, autumn grey shirts, winter dark blue, spring light blue. I quite like the material of the Paul Atreides bed shirt, but a little more professional (yet still loose-fitting).

Decluttering the Idea of Sewing my Own Clothes?,"I have this idea that someday I'm going to sew my own clothing. Recently I've been thinking that this may be a ""fantasy self"" issue. I would like to hear your thoughts on the subject because all I've heard so far are from a non-minimalist point of view. 

In the past year or two I've been decluttering even more, I want to focus more on my work and my children, and less on unnecessary housework and ""stuff management."" I also have the increasing desire to get things in order - organize and scan all my old photos that aren't digital, back up and secure all my digital photos, write up a will, take care of things like that and prepare for natural disasters (in a minimalist way, I'm not stockpiling large amounts of food and supplies).   

One of the things that I noticed is I have a lot of hobbies. I have a lot of sewing supplies in particular and although I have gone through my supplies and decluttered them somewhat, I still have scrap fabrics, notions and patterns I would like to do. 

The day before yesterday I completed one of those patterns and used some of the fabric and elastic to make a skirt. It looks nice, it fits, it's comfortable, but I know I'm not going to wear it as often as the thrift store skirt I wore all summer. 

I have this vision in my mind that I'm going to get really good at sewing ""someday"" and I'll be able to make a whole (minimalist) closet of clothes all by myself and I'll never have to rely on shopping at a store and getting a bad fit. 

But the reality is that sewing is difficult, sweaty work. I don't enjoy it. I don't hate it per say, but it takes up a lot of time. A single garment can take 4-30 hours of work depending on the complexity. 

I'm not decluttering my sewing machine and some of the other tools I have for repairs because it is useful when I need it, but the fabric stash and the idea of having a me-made wardrobe might be out the window if I can't make something I like soon. 

My alternative fantasy self is a woman who owns a very minimalist wardrobe, and she is in opposition to my seamstress fantasy self.

My Start to More Intentional Minimalism,"I used to be more of an unintentional minimalist, because I was just really organized and had recently moved away from parents back in my colege years. So I didn't have much of my own stuff.

But not so much the last 6 or so years of my life after graduating. After wrangling some hard hurdles in life, I'm ready to address it.

The last 3 weeks, I've been filling up small boxes with donatable stuff. Each week I have filled up atleast 4 boxes for donation, which is my limit so I know when to chill out, since I get very manic on projects and forget to self care. And thre away quite a lot of bags of trash.

A lot of this stuff was accumulated through my weakness of allowing myself to be persuaded by people in my life telling me things like ""what if you're going to need that later,"" and things like that. As well as depressing and bad living circumstances kept me from caring about my living situation for a good chuck of the last 3 or so years.

I don't have a lot of furniture to begin with, so a lot of my stuff is already in cardboard boxes, but was stuffed in places in closets and under my bed, and on top of folding tables. It got really bad...

I still have a ton I need to go through, but the place is looking more empty. It is way easier to vacuum, and I have less things to look at, which makes my life less overwhelming.

Once I have all the gunk out, I would love to actually buy furniture that works for me, instead of things that just kind of exist with half purpose. 

But yeah, I will continue the journey slow and steady, and I am proud of my progress so far. 

Also, Happy holidays everyone. I don't really celebrate today, so I'm just chilling and self contemplating rn. I'm too poor to buy people presents and I won't guilt my financial wellbeing away. I also don't want to receive random gifts from people I will end up just donating or tossing later.

Anyways, end of thoughts for now!


TL;DR - Just restarted my journey back to minimalism. Been throwing out a ton of stuff so I can get furniture that is actually useful and wanted. Home is starting to look empty and is easier to clean, and I am very happy about that. Happy holidays.",minimalism,1735150363.0

Share your stuffs as a photographer / Videographer?,"**Hey everyone!**

I‚Äôm considering deleting Instagram from my phone (not my profile!), but there‚Äôs a major obstacle: the only way to post photos and videos on the platform is through the official app on a phone.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*^(To clarify, Meta Business Suite is awful, Instagram isn‚Äôt well-supported on iPad, the desktop version is incomplete and poorly optimized, and (let‚Äôs be real Meta intentionally does this to force people to use the app on their personal phones. I won‚Äôt dive too deep into this, but it‚Äôs frustrating.))*

Despite this, I don‚Äôt want to stop uploading my content because it‚Äôs an important part of my hobby and identity.

I will own two things instead of one if that simplies my head-space,"As I mature into minimalist life style, I'm starting to find that minimalism in my head is as important as physical minimalism. Of course they are closely related; less stuff = clear mind. Right?

Yes, for the most part, but not always. Listening from a dedicated CD player without internect connection allows you to enjoy music more. Reading from Kindle reader instead of android tablet lets you stay with the book longer. Playing a movie from DVD player makes you watch the movie instead of jumping between new mediocre movies and never commiting to watching them.

Would I love to be a person who can read from iPad and never get distracted? Finish a whole music album without switching to a new song? Actually start and finish a movie without stopping in the middle? Yes, of course I would love to. But, it is very hard.....almost impossible. I've tried and I'm sure you did too.

Turns out having a dedicated object that does only one thing is very important for the full immersive experience. That's why I went back to owning a camera, mp3 player, cd player, ebooks, non-smart watch, etc, despite having my 'smartphone'. At some point, I thought I could live out of my backpack.

Who else is doing a no buy for January?,"I have been told about no buys and if I understand correctly, you‚Äôre able to adjust the rules to suit your goals. I‚Äôd love to hear if anyone else is attempting one and what their plan is!

My step daughter has four families that buy for her. I love getting her presents but I think she gets way too much than is practical and I spend more than I should. I tried setting a budget and sticking to it, that definitely helped me scale back but I think even if money was no object there is too much stuff being brought into the house. 

I‚Äôve heard methods like: something you wear, something you read, something you want and something you need, but if she was getting less gifts of a higher value ultimately she would want to pick them out and then the whole ‚Äúgifting‚Äù is lost. It becomes just buying things from a laundry list.

Keeping hobbies /items I know Ill return to later?,"Please no ""minimalism is what you make it/amount of items doesnt count"" comments. Its not helpful. Thanks

Now to my question:

Im on my minimalism Journey and have reduced my belongings quite significantly. Hoewever I still feel like I have too much. Packing away the off season wardrobe has also helped a lot. Less feels good, Im calmer and emotionally more stable.

Spring '24 I got into a fashion hobby. I see, so it does fit in. Over winter I didnt wear it much and now Im circling back. I habe that with multiple things which is why I do well with keeping multiple hobbies on hand for when I need sonething else. Just one doesnt work for me.

However it does feel like Im keeping more than I need :/ so Im unsure how to deal and it does feel a little excessive and luxurious to have so many hobbies on hand.

What would you do? Critically look at what sparks most joy and keep three? Or keep more and pair those down to joy sparking essentials?

On Utility vs Symbolism,"I have been a minimalist for over a decade now but something I have been thinking about a lot and noticing over the past couple of years is a change in the items that I do decide to bring into and keep in my life.

A couple examples...

1. I owned a Garmin GPS watch for a number of years and tracked my running in Strava. The more I thought about why I owned it and why I track my data, the more I thought I didn't need it (it was more to prove the kind of person I was i.e. someone that works out and takes my health seriously than anything to do with using the data) so I sold it and replaced it with a cheap Casio G shock.

2. I have played guitar for many years and owned a gorgeous 1994 Taylor 410. A beautiful guitar made from real solid wood which sounded amazing and I had looked after it well and kept it in immaculate condition. However, over time, it began to feel more like a burden as I considered that I am often worried about damaging it and the pressure my family would feel about what to do with it when I am no longer here (I hope that is a long way off yet :D). Ultimately, I decided to sell on the higher end item and replace it with a fairly cheap ""beater"" guitar which I am not worried about dinging up and am happy to play it in the garden, chuck it in the boot of the car etc. I still get the same joy out of the cheaper item but perhaps it comes with less social status (which I find myself caring about less, the older I get).

"Taking risks, being unique, and embracing luxury ‚Äì My caseless journey with the iPhone 16 Plus","
Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my experience with my brand-new iPhone 16 Plus ‚Äì my first-ever iPhone. Choosing to go caseless was a deliberate and exciting decision for me. I wanted to experience the device‚Äôs beauty as it was designed, feel the luxury in my hands, and reflect courage and boldness ‚Äì because, to me, taking risks is a way of life.

But as life often does, it gave me a lesson early on. During the first week of using the phone, after smoking some weed and feeling a little less focused, I put my phone in my pocket with a lighter. The lighter left a small scratch on the screen, right near the back button. That scratch hit me hard ‚Äì I was down for two or three days, questioning if I made the wrong decision.

Then I came here, after a conversation with GPT that opened my mind and heart. I discovered that there are others like me, people who see this device as more than just a tool ‚Äì but as a statement, a work of art, a symbol of beauty and boldness. That‚Äôs how I found this community on Reddit, and realizing I‚Äôm not alone made this experience even more special.

I‚Äôve come to believe that this scratch is part of my story ‚Äì just like the marks and scars we carry in life with pride. Going caseless is taking a risk ‚Äì but it‚Äôs also about fully feeling and living life.

What I especially love about this choice is the sense of status and uniqueness it brings. How many people do you know who go caseless with a brand-new, expensive iPhone? Not many. But beyond the status, what really matters to me is the time I get to enjoy it without a case ‚Äì every moment I get to experience the device as it is. That‚Äôs priceless.

I have insurance for my phone, which gives me peace of mind. But this is about more than insurance ‚Äì it‚Äôs a reflection of how I choose to live my life.

I live my life driven by love, not fear. I truly believe that the most dangerous thing in this world ‚Äì and in life where time is limited ‚Äì is not taking risks. The moments we experience, the quality of the time we spend ‚Äì those are the most precious things we have. I choose to believe, to love, and to live life to its fullest.

Remember: Life isn‚Äôt about avoiding scratches; it‚Äôs about collecting the stories that come with them.",minimalism,1735445113.0

"People look at minimalism as an odd lifestyle, but I'm beginning to see capitalism as a cult (opinion)","Absolute rant. Sorry in advance.
TL; DR: Capitalism is a cult and I'm ready to be excommunicated.

Why is it so strange to the average person (in america at least) that I prefer to own slightly less than I need. I don't want to buy something new, I want to repair and care for what I have. I don't want to have closets and cabinets full of stuff that is convenient for those few times a year you actually need it, or a garage or basement full of decorations used for 3 weeks a year.




Every time I tell someone Im chucking the majority of the things in my household because they don't get used or take more care than my husband or I are willing to give, people look at me like I'm fringe society.
Ostracizing people for living a different lifestyle, buying them things they literally requested against, pushing them more into the capitalist lifestyle all feels a bit like cult like to me. 




One of my first wake up calls was moving to Connecticut from Boston, I asked a local what there was to do in the area. She suggested Boston or NYC... I then asked for something in CT to do and she suggested several malls and quaint shopping towns.



I'll be honest Ive spent a lot of my 35 years feeling similarly. But the last 10ish years have really opened my eyes to how indoctrinated our society is to capitalism. I'm finally relieved my husband is on board with minimizing our possessions and just being happy with free space at home and in our calendar.

Futon couch as a bed-experiences?,"I apologize if this is a stupid question/has been answered a lot in the sub already. 

I‚Äôm a college student about to move into an apartment with only a small room for myself. I like having an area to sit and rest in my room that is not at my desk, but sitting on beds hurts my back as they‚Äôre usually too soft, and I don‚Äôt get much support. 

So, I thought of getting a futon (the ones you fold up to make a couch) as a permanent bed. I‚Äôm asian and prefer harder surfaces when sleeping, so thought a couch could straight up even be a better bed for me, since I sleep on the couch at home pretty frequently too and find no issue. I am however worried that sleeping on a couch LONG TERM would harm my already-aching back.

I did consider a Japanese futon, but thinking about it made me wonder whether it would clutter up my small room even more i.e. when folded, which goes against my goal. The apartment I‚Äôm moving into has carpet floors too, which I do not trust my blankets touching lol.

New to minimalism ,"Hi everyone! Recently I‚Äôve had an enormous desire to get rid of ALL the junk in my house. It all started when we wanted to buy bigger toys for our toddler but they had nowhere to go so much husband suggested we clean out the guest room to make a play room. That was a HUGE win for me bc it was all his furniture from his apt before he moved in w me and was holding on to his grandmas hideous desk and tons of junk. That room was the bane of my existence as it became our catch all room. Well anywho now that that room is now a playroom and all his toys are in there instead of in random places all over the house I‚Äôm realizing that he literally doesn‚Äôt need anymore toys lol. And I have various closets and storage cabinets that are just full of stuff that I don‚Äôt use  and don‚Äôt want to look at. 
It feels like such an overwhelming process to declutter the WHOLE house whilst also looking after my toddler. But my desire to get rid of everything is also overwhelming and consuming. I jokingly said that the best Christmas gift anyone could get me is childcare while I realllly dig in and purge everything lol but that‚Äôs not going to happen I don‚Äôt guess, i would need at least a full day or two.

Struggling to Align Minimalism with Our Family Life ‚Äì Seeking Advice,"Hi everyone! This is my first ever Reddit post, here goes‚Ä¶

My family and I are at a crossroads, and I‚Äôd love your input. Minimalism resonates deeply with me‚Äîwe value simplicity, intentionality, and creating a life focused on experiences rather than things. After dabbling for many years, I‚Äôm finally ready to jump two feet in (and my husband is not far behind me!) But we‚Äôre trying to figure out how to align these principles with our current reality, and it‚Äôs complicated.

Here‚Äôs where we are:
- We live in a big, beautiful home in Golden, Colorado. It‚Äôs lovely, but it feels like too much‚Äîtoo much space, too much maintenance, and too many costs that don‚Äôt align with how we want to live. Lawn care alone averages $350/month. What?!?!
- Downsizing is on our minds, but we still enjoy having some ‚Äúnice‚Äù things and don‚Äôt want to strip our lives bare. How do you balance minimalism with wanting quality, aesthetically pleasing items?
- We have two young kids (4 months and 3.5 years old), and we want to give them a life filled with rich experiences and meaningful memories. How can we focus on these goals while simplifying our lives?
- Moving closer to Denver for better access to cultural events, trails, and community is also appealing, but we‚Äôre not sure where or what kind of home would suit us best.
- We have a ton of equity in our current home and could theoretically afford to buy a smaller home outright in cash. But we‚Äôre unsure if that‚Äôs the right move‚Äîshould we rent for a while to test out a simpler lifestyle before committing?

I‚Äôm also noticing my strong desire to dive into minimalism 150%, but I‚Äôm hesitant about moving too fast and making decisions we might regret. How do you pace yourself with big lifestyle changes like this?

One more thing: we both still want to work AND we work from home right now. Lots of zoom calls so working out in the open doesn‚Äôt quite work for either of us. We need the dedicated space. Minimalism, for us, isn‚Äôt about quitting our jobs and going full nomadic‚Äîit‚Äôs more about creating a life with more time, energy, and financial freedom to focus on what matters most.

I‚Äôd love to hear from people who‚Äôve faced similar decisions:
1. If you‚Äôve downsized with a family, how did you decide where to go and what kind of home was right for you? Did you ever miss your yard etc? 
2. How do you reconcile minimalism with still enjoying beautiful, high-quality things?
3. Any tips for making downsizing feel freeing rather than limiting‚Äîespecially with young kids?
4. What are the biggest surprises or lessons you‚Äôve learned from embracing a minimalist lifestyle as a family?
5. Have you rented as a way to ‚Äútest‚Äù downsizing before committing? If so, how did it go?
6. For those who have made the jump, how much money did you end up saving per month?

Futon/ Floor Mattress Experiences ,"So to make a long story short, I moved recently and found out that my mattress was the cause of my chronic back pain. Since the move I've just been sleeping on the floor with my pillow and some blankets. My back pain is 90% gone and I was able to sell the mattress and bed frame with full disclosure to the buyer. 

Also after having to move all my stuff by myself again I'm sort of sick of owning big, bulky furniture. I'm thinking about getting a Futon or floor mattress, but I've never bought one, and would love to hear other's experiences. I have a coworker that owns a Futon because of her back pain too. I did ask, she said she bought hers online for $150 on Amazon since there aren't really any stores in America that sell them. I guess I just don't know what to look for in terms of quality or what's an average amount to spend. I'd love to find one that can fold or roll up very small since portability is a major concern for me. I've read a lot about Tatami mats, but are they necessary or are there other ways to maintain/ care for them? I don't think they sell Tatami mats in America either. I'm genuinely curious to hear from other people that have been floor sleeping for a while.

Gift giving problems (to me) ,"I (32M) don't exactly know when I got into minimalism but I think since my early teenage years I've had this disdain for accumulating stuff needlessly and just wanted to acquire only what is essential/makes me truly happy. I only later learned that this was one aspect of minimalism. My costs are down and simplified. I'm happy I don't go for trends. I buy quality over quantity. I am more clean and organized. Despite these clear advantages, there's been some downsides to minimalism for me: My girlfriend (28F) has had an excruciatingly hard time giving me gifts for the past 6 years we've been together. She's told me that I'm so particular about what I buy and that I always hold off buying things I want (at the moment), that she's afraid she'll get me something I won't use or like. It's completely logical on her part. She has some idea of what I like (hobbies, interests, etc) but has trouble piecing together what I'd appreciate as a gift. She won't ask me outright because she wants gifts to be a surprise. She's not minimalist btw. During this holiday season or even my birthday, I usually don't get gifts. I just usually take us out for a nice date/meal. Despite my constant strive to buy only what is essential and live a more purposeful life, I can't help but feel frustrated.

Considering ditching my Fitbit. Will I regret it?,"My Fitbit broke and I'll be receiving a replacement in a few days. I needed to send mine back first and with Xmas season it takes a while so as I'm waiting for it I'm wearing my basic wristwatch, and actually enjoying it. It makes me think that I might be okay without the fitbit... but?

I've had a tracker for a good 10+ years, I only used it for basics (daily steps, hourly steps and weekly active minutes), kind of looking at heart rate too at times. I think that these are all good, minimalistic targets. By now, I have good routines to meet them though so I could just keep doing what I'm doing I guess, without the counts. Also, having to charge it every few days is a chore.

My concerns are:

* I might be missing out on that small bit of motivation for a bit of extra effort to improve routines over time.
* I might get too comfortable and lose my routines. I don't feel like logging manually would be a simplification and some aren't easy to log.
* I kind of liked looking at historical data. How much did I walk in the pandemic, how was my activity historically. Am I keeping up with myself through the years. That would be lost now.

Physical Media Collection Paradox,"Surely I can't be alone in this. 

I've gone to great lengths to minimize over the past 7 years. Honestly I need to do another round again and I'm about to buy a bunch of storage boxes to do ""leveling"" before I really start killing my darlings again. (I find it's easiest for me to have boxes to contain ideas of things and then nuke them and get rid of the boxes when done. It just makes it make sense for me.)

But, there is one part that is wholly at odds with some aspects of what I'm trying to achieve and in some cases I feel my hand is forced.

PHYSICAL MEDIA. Books. Movies, CDs/Vinyl. 

When I started minimalism, my physical library was about 900 books, 500 film/tv discs, 800 albums.

My physical library has grown (most of it recently). I now have about 2000 books, 1500 film/tv discs, 1000 albums. 

Let me explain.

In many cases I took huge steps to compress it all down to just binders full of my discs and got rid of the artwork and cases. Especially in the era of digitization and me owning many digital copies of things or having access to digital copies, I also needed far less immediate access to physical copies. So storing it in a binder hasn't really been an issue. Besides, I mostly kept them because I wanted access to all the special features, commentaries, documentaries, and other cool film nerd stuff that can be a lot harder to access via streaming. 

I also started buying less physical books because audiobooks became my primary method of experiencing books. So unless it was a book I was in love with, I wasn't sure I wanted to have it physically. Though, I suspect many minimalists probably still hold on to books like I do. They really are something special. They're little blocks of sliced up magic wood. LOL. 

And I'm not explaining my albums, I hate music streaming, I'm not even delving into that. People have irritated me for years about that stuff. I like the physical media, that's all that needs to be said there. (And I collect it very very slowly compared to the other stuff, I'm really intentional with it).

Ok, so what changed? Why have I suddenly doubled or tripled my collection? I've done the math. There is literally no way for me to consume all the content I have for the rest of my reasonably expected lifetime and do other things with my life (like work and be with my family etc). I know all this, and yet, I collect, and I've increased it dramatically. Why?

Loss avoidance. But a VERY specific kind of loss avoidance. The kind I'm willing to engage in because it strikes at the heart of what I learned I wanted my life to be about when I went through this process initially. 

Some of you may be unaware, but digital content has been being altered. Books and movies are edited to either fulfill the artists original intentions or to remove what presentism has deemed to be current heresy or offense. Furthermore, large corporations have decided ""I don't wanna pay people for their work"" and instead of figuring out residuals paid to the people who made great artwork they just strip the media from their service leaving no obvious legal way to procure said media, no matter how genuinely valuable that work of art was. 

When I became a father, I realized that none of the work I do is for me. I enjoy what others built before me and then I build for others to enjoy after me. That is the great chain we're all part of. The grand pay it forward promise. Your ancestors sacrificed for you, you in turn must sacrifice for your offspring. etc. Part of that is the protection of that which truly has value. And while it's true that we as minimalists find it necessary, in fact mission essential, to cut down and remove and trim those things dragging down what has value; it is also the case (at least for me) that we are emboldened to procure or preserve or engage with that which has genuine value. 

As a writer myself, I STRONGLY believe in narrative as art. In fact, my belief is that all art is actually narrative, they're the same thing. So I consider the media I take interest in to be of utmost importance. I also feel that media is under attack whether from greed or moralization or ideology or...whatever. I can't stop the tide of the world, the press of time, or a revolutionary army. But, I do believe physical media is worth protecting because it protects the past so it can be delivered to the future in tact, so art, our narrative, can be preserved. 

And so I'm at odds with myself. I've created a PLeX library and ripped my physical media so I can enjoy it conveniently digitized like any other streaming service (I stream my movie collection from my own server I built myself and can use it all over the world just like other streaming services). But I also at times find the process tedious and frustrating because honestly, I wish I could do other things with my time. But then I go to do those other things (with my kids) and I find a piece of art that's been tampered with and walk out of the theater with my kids in tow, frustrated AGAIN for the lack of respect shown, and I'm driven back to the never ending process of acquiring, digitizing, and safeguarding MORE physical media. For I know not what other way I can engage with the enemy that seeks to destroy art. 

And so I feel a bit disgruntled, irritated, annoyed. I love the works of art I'm maintaining and protecting. I love sharing them with people. I love watching my kids as they see a classic piece of cinema, y'know THAT scene, when THAT scene happens and they laugh or cry or jump for the first time at it. I love my son running to me after finishing a book that blew my mind and his mind is blown for the first time. And when I see the companies and advocacy groups and religious orgs and all these people just tampering with stuff, it feels like they're tampering with what I try to share with my kids. It feels like they're treading on some of the most valued and sacred things in my life. Because they aren't messing with my things, they're messing with my family. And I hate that. 

If they wanna alter their own copy of something. FINE, go for it, it's yours. But they want to alter MY copy of a piece of art because THEY don't like it, don't wanna pay for it, whatever? UGH, NO. STOP.

Minimalists: Do you have any clothes/shoes/rags for doing dirty work? ,"It's difficult for me to justify throwing away a t-shirt that I keep specifically when I deal in dirty work (stuff that involves bleach, paint, grease, etc).

Let‚Äôs Talk Water Bottles,"I‚Äôve carried a water bottle with me since my early childhood years, so I know the value of a good bottle. Below is my current water bottle lineup:

1. ‚ÄúDaily carry‚Äù ‚Äî YETI Yonder (25oz.)
2. Bike rides ‚Äî 2x Gatorade green squeeze bottles (32oz. each)
3. Protein ‚Äî Ice Shaker (26oz.)
4. Hiking/bikepacking ‚Äî 1x Nalgene Ultralight 32oz. and 1x Nalgene Ultralight 64oz. 

Two things I‚Äôm trying to address here:

A. I feel that I have too many bottles, and that there‚Äôs room to create overlap in these categories. Ideally, I‚Äôd like to have the fewest number of bottles that can service my daily life, hobbies, etc.

B. Over the past year, I have made a concerted effort to examine my plastics usage (mostly for health/hormone purposes) and try to replace highly-used items with metal alternatives.

The current lineup has a lot of plastic in it. I‚Äôve read that the Nalgene HDPEs are pretty safe (as far as plastics go) so I‚Äôm inclined to hang onto those for my hiking/bikepacking needs because it allows me to carry so much water when necessary. I love the Gatorade bottles for riding, as they‚Äôre so easy to grab and squeeze ‚Äî but again, likely filled with problematic plastics (they‚Äôre both pretty old too). 

I‚Äôve been eyeing the Black + Blum Explorer bottle (28oz.) for my everyday carry, as it can also mount to a bike cage for commutes and easy riding. Anyone have any recommendations for my ‚Äúwater bottle lineup‚Äù?? 

UPDATE: Well, the universe made my decision for me. My partner contracted norovirus, and he grabbed my Yeti Yonder bottle for water (before asking). Long story short, everything in the house is getting bleached, and as it turns out ‚Äî the Yonder can‚Äôt handle bleach. One less plastic bottle in the mix!

From Maximalist Chaos to Minimalist Peace: Reflections on Clutter Across Generations,"I‚Äôm 24 now, and after six years of living on my own, I feel like I‚Äôve finally embraced minimalism‚Äîa lifestyle I‚Äôve been drawn to since I was 14. But my journey didn‚Äôt start in a minimalist space. I grew up in chaos: my childhood bedroom was a disaster zone, crammed with stuff, a true maximalist nightmare. You could say I‚Äôm a reformed maximalist. Over the past three years, I‚Äôve made huge progress decluttering and creating a more intentional space.

Returning home for the holidays, though, was a real eye-opener. My mom‚Äôs house is overwhelmed with clutter. There‚Äôs a whole room, ‚Äúthe study,‚Äù that‚Äôs packed to the brim with boxes, papers, and who-knows-what. The attic? Same story. My mom even said to me, ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôll be cleaning for the rest of my life.‚Äù It hit me‚Äîthis clutter is draining her, mentally and emotionally. No wonder I was so desperate to escape it and pursue minimalism.

Minimalism has been a game-changer for me. Inspired by Goodbye, Things and Marie Kondo‚Äôs philosophy, I‚Äôve curated a life where my closet isn‚Äôt bursting at the seams, my walls are nearly blank, and my possessions are few but intentional. The peace of mind I‚Äôve found is priceless: no more frantic searches for misplaced items, less housework, and just‚Ä¶ more clarity.

I‚Äôve tried to help my mom declutter, but it‚Äôs a no-go. She‚Äôs particular about her things, and any attempt to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù adds to her stress. I‚Äôve realized this isn‚Äôt just her problem, though‚Äîit seems to be common in her generation (60+). Visiting her friends‚Äô homes, I‚Äôve noticed the same patterns: boxes of papers, overflowing shelves, unorganized piles everywhere. How does this happen? Is it just the accumulation of a lifetime, or is there something deeper at play?

Interestingly, I‚Äôve also noticed a contrast with wealthier, highly organized people I know. Their homes are pristine, clutter-free, and intentional. It‚Äôs not just about money‚Äîthey seem to prioritize habits and systems that keep chaos at bay.

So here‚Äôs my question: How do you avoid the creeping clutter that seems to take over as life goes on? And for those who‚Äôve grown up in maximalist environments, how has it shaped your relationship with minimalism?",minimalism,1736087931.0
minimalism vs instant gratification aka impulse buying ,"Hi everyone. It‚Äôs been years since I‚Äôve started simplifying my life and minimizing my belongings. I deeply believe in minimalism values and would like to continue this journey. 

However, once in a while I have this urge to buy new stuff for 2 reasons:
- I want to give myself some kind of a prize 
- I want to cheer myself up after a bad day.
It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a pack of gum or new pair of shoes. The dopamine goes higher for couple of seconds and then I feel normal again or ever worse - I have a sudden feeling of remorse. 

I believe it‚Äôs that way since as a child/young adult I was unable to buy myself stuff I wanted. I grow up with a fear familiar to every kid that is from a poor household. Now I have my ‚Äúadult money‚Äù and I‚Äôm constantly between ‚ÄúI need to save money cause I‚Äôm scared‚Äù and ‚ÄúI need to buy this because simply - I want and I can‚Äù.

Versatile sofa solution for a small space,"For the last few years, I've been renting a small room with family and it looks like I may be here for around another year as I save for a move. A few years ago, I got into VR, which has worked as a great solution for making sure I stay physically active every day. This led to what turned into a drastic decluttering of my living space. Not only did I get rid of all the extraneous things in my space, I even found minimalist solutions for things I still actively used. My goal was to make everything in my living space collapsible and able to be tucked away into the closet so that my room could be quickly and easily turned into a completely empty 10.5x10.5 ft space that I could use for VR. I exchanged my bed for a hammock in a collapsible metal frame (and I've been getting the best sleep of my life since doing so), got myself a collapsible computer chair, got rid of my desk in favor of a hinged board attached to the wall that I can fold out and lock into place for a desk, and then fold down against the wall again when I'm not using it. And I mounted both my computer monitor and TV to the wall instead of putting them on desks or stands. 

This is all worked great for the most part. Not only do I have space for VR, I feel much better about my living area. The only problem is that, over time, I've noticed not having a dedicated place to sit besides my computer chair has become a problem. Sometimes I want to sit in something more comfortable than my computer chair and because I don't have anything else, I find I've defaulted to lying down in the hammock. This hasn't been good for me, since I have narcolepsy and I need to try not to nap excessively. Plus, I think my brain is coming to associate the hammock with not just a place to sleep, but also a general place to rest. Overtime, this is led to me constantly being tempted to nap. 

I need some sort of sofa or other non-computer chair seating solution, but one that can be easily folded or collapsed and put away, to clear the space for VR. Since I work a lot and can't squeeze in the gym on work days, VR is an almost daily thing for me, in order to stay active. I've looked at various things like inflatable sofas and those collapsible couch things that can be folded into what essentially amounts to a stack of cushions, but neither are ideal. The inflatable stuff takes a while to inflate and deflate, and my closet is pretty small so the collapsible couches be difficult to get out of the way. 

So, since I'm pretty new to all this, I keep thinking maybe there's some sort of creative solution I haven't thought of. It doesn't need to be in an actual couch or sofa form. I just need a relatively comfortable crash spot that isn't my hammock, and is easy to tuck out of the way when I want to clear space for VR.

Reducing hobbies advice please,"I‚Äôm at a point in my minimalism journey where I have reduced clothes, toiletries, kitchen items etc down to somewhere I‚Äôm happy with. However my greatest amount of items I now own are hobby related. 

I seem to find this the hardest area to reduce as I dip in and out of hobbies over the course of a year, however they take up a vast amount of space. For example I love to upcycle clothes, however, all the machinery, fabrics and equipment for sewing take up a lot of space. Similarly with crochet, I have accumulated so much yarn for projects, however, I have just reached a point of overwhelm where I don‚Äôt know where to start. Other stuff related hobbies I do include jewellery making, lino cutting, playing instruments (I am down to one acoustic guitar , one electric and one bass), then there‚Äôs the active hobbies like yoga, I have a pole for pole dancing, a hula hoop.

It just feels like downsizing in any one of these areas feels like giving up on a dream. It‚Äôs just difficult as I am not even sure myself which passion I want to continue enjoying or to dedicate my time to 100%. I love creative hobbies but they just bring so much clutter along with them. And fully decluttering any one of them feels like giving up a part of myself. I do realise as I‚Äôm typing that this i have a heavy attachment to these hobby items. 

I guess what I‚Äôm asking, is that I would love to focus on a few select hobbies but with more dedication. But I can‚Äôt decide which of these to choose. And I struggle to let go of the hobby related items as it feels like giving up on that particular passion. Does anybody have any advice of how to overcome this particular hurdle? 

As a note, I have previously sold my sewing machine in an attempt to reduce the sewing related clutter, however, a year later repurchased as I wanted to upcycle again! The same thing with the hula hoop. So I am also conscious that I don‚Äôt want to feel the need to start the hobbies up again after having stopped them.

Fantasy Self or an Actual Desire?,"With minimalism, there's sometimes talk about the fantasy self. You keep or/and buy things for a fantasy self, someone you want to be but someone you'll never be. E.g., buying a lot of books because you want to be an avid reader and have a nice collection, but in the end you barely read anything because you'd rather do something else. Maybe you wanted to come across as well-read or you liked what people who read a lot represents to you. But being a bookworm isn't who you really are. 

Well, Marie Kondo talks about ''Think about your ideal future, who do you want to be, what kind of life you want'' when decluttering. I think it's helpful, but this also makes me wonder. What's the difference between an actual desired future self VS fantasy self? How do you make the distinction?

Mental Health Discoveries (Good&Bad),"I'm curious about others. For myself, I've been doing it for a few years. I'm overall happier. However, I've discovered I have an addiction to streamlining facets of my life and get a large dopamine rush from them. After a few years of this and having less than I've ever had in my life, I'm more calm and at peace and less stressed. But I don't have anything new to really replace the dopamine rush spare playing instruments and video games with friends and my partner. Overall, I feel like there is still a huge void left in the wake of removing the consumer part of who I was. Buying things for the most part, is not an interest to me which is great. My wallet is thankful.  
  
I'm finding more and more yearning for a community that I do not have, which is unfortunately why I hang around online spaces so much. I don't use twitter or instagram and haven't for quite a while now. I'm hoping to develop a less attached relationship to reddit soon (I feel the frustrations outweighing the benefits, so I feel like I'm already on the right path) People can only access me by text and discord and I do really enjoy the quiet that a tech-lite (relative to most of the world) has offered me. It's given me time to face uncomfortable feelings (like now) with myself and try to work forward towards something better. This experience has facilitated more for myself than therapy ever has (not shafting therapy, just an observation).

But idk. I'm missing community but it feels like I'm lacking something even deeper than that. I didn't have any aim for minimalism to fix that. It has actually done what I wanted, which was to give myself space to breathe and be with my thoughts and not to be occupied with static and noise. Consumerism has taken up so much of my brain case that now I'm really not sure what to do with all the excess space. There's things I enjoy doing and I routinely indulge in those things.

I snapped,"One Reddit Account and too many months ago I posted in this subreddit about how I have locked up quite a big part of my belongings I no longer want nor need in my daily life in order to ‚Äûtame the beast‚Äú.  My goal was to declutter it all by Christmas, well, that mission has failed.  
Today I was watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKxl-oukXmU) video and had a physical feeling of big the discrepancy of how I live versus how I want to live has gotten. This sudden burst of energy resulted in me snapping. I brought a few of my containers filled with stuff into the living room and sorted the insides into 4 categories:  
\- keep  
\- sell/donate  
\- not my stuff  
\- sentimental

I ended up keeping roughly a quarter of the things I went through today. Mostly I kept things I feel obliged to keep such as the T-Shirts I was gifted but never wear and don‚Äòt ever will wear. But this is appears to be a battle for another day.  
So I snapped and worked a little bit towards how I want to be and live - this might just be enough for today.

Iphone (12 mini) case + wallet recs?

minimalism and pregnancy,"after being quite minimalist for most of my 20s, my early 30s allowed me more space and resources to expand. probably too much. 

pregnancy has been a wake up call. First, I stopped fitting into 90% of my clothes. Now, they're all packed up to go through after the baby comes. But I feel like I'll want to get rid of most of them.

Now, I have very few outfits that I can functionally wear because of not wanting to over do it on maternity wear. It's kind of amazing to have no choices. 

I also need to go through all my personal things, books, digital clutter, etc. before the baby comes as my space for these will be the nursery. It's scary but I feel like I'll just... let so much go.

Lipstick dilemma - please help,"TL;DR in the last paragraph. 

Hello everybody,
I'm new to the sub, but definitely not new to minimalism. Looking for advice. This post will probably be way too long for the dilemma I'm facing, I'm sorry.

My flavour of minimalism is a bit different, as I do stock up on consumable items, especially since I have my favourites and they are often not widely sold. Some stuff is easy to decide: toothpaste, shampoo, deodorant, the daily basics. Some stuff though, like make-up, I use regularly, but not daily. I have just one small drawer of make- up and skincare, which I revisit twice a year to see if anything is nearing its end to possibly rebuy. And here we come to my dilemma: 

After years of trial and mostly error I found a lipstick I love to wear. For a long time it was my only lipstick in only one shade that I just bought over and over again, it suited me, I had no desire to experiment, you could even say it was my signature colour. I wanted to get another one for New year... It's discontinued. The only shop (online) that still sells this lipstick in my country ran out of my 'signature' colour. I got a bit crazy and ordered 4 different colours of the same lipstick just for the formula, hoping that one of them would also suit me. 2 out of the 4 are absolute hits. Love them, even more than the previous one, it's  even better, as they are just two different shades of one colour (one deep and edgy and the other lighter and more neutral: office vibes). The formula is the same of course, so no issue here. Now here's the problem: said shop only has 16 pieces of one and 9 of the other. There will not be anymore, as the whole line is discontinued. 

Another 'problem' (or solution)is: this is not an expensive lipstick. I could, theoretically, go completely bananas, get all of them and keep them safe in my pantry which holds a steady slightly below room temperature in hopes of not having to return to lipstick seeking in the foreseeable future. Make-up doesn't spoil that easily, especially if it's unopened. 

Now on one hand it's healthy to just let it go, enjoy the two new shades I have for as long as they last and call it a day. 

On the other hand I feel like companies do this on purpose, so you are kept clueless and looking for another thing that would work the way the original did, spending more money in the process on lipsticks (or whatever else) that you'll end up throwing away unused. It annoys me and I kind of feel like getting a prepper- level amount of favourite lipstick is a tiny act of rebellion against this stupid industry. 

Thoughts?

TL;DR: my (one and only favourite) lipstick has been discontinued. Do I stock up from the only shop in my country that still holds a few, or am I insane to even consider getting years worth of it? It's not expensive. 

UPDATE: thank you everyone for your insights! I got 10 of them in the end, which is both more than necessary and at the same time less than I was tempted to get.  üíã For Y'all!",minimalism,1736374921.0

Minimalism isn‚Äôt the cure for depression everyone says it is,"Ever since maybe 2014 my husband and I learned about this great concept of ‚Äúminimalism‚Äù.

A financial minimalism question,"I would like to start by stating how grateful I am for my situation, as I know many are not so fortunate. I'm 27 years old, and my lovely fianc√© and I are about 6 months from having the rest of our student loans paid off. We have an incredible income (I'm an ICU PA-C, and she's a social worker) and we gross about 185,000 annually before taxes. 

We've been on a debt pay off and financial journey for about 2 years. We have been living substantially below our means in that time. I save about 20% of my gross income towards retirement, which is arguably way too much, and I plan to drop this to 15% when I turn 30. About 25% goes away to taxes (oh well), and another 25% has been going towards loans. So all in all, we've been living on 55K annually (with 2 cats and a dog, 2300/month mortgage, groceries, gas, utilities, and a small fun money margin) by not eating out, not traveling, and fighting temptation to consume. 

  
My actual minimalist question is; soon once our debt is gone and we have a 4 month emergency fund, our income will rise substantially by the 30% or so we've been saving so aggressively. Being intentional with purchases, not over consuming, and being generous are important to us. **I want advice on how I can help curb lifestyle creep and overconsumption when we'll have an extra $35,000 annually to spend!** We are huge on travel, nothing lavish, but want to take backpacking trips and fly places. Some of our baseline expenses will increase, ei grocery budget as we want to shift from shopping aldi, to local small grocers and a local CSA for our meat and produce. But all in all, I'm nervous that we may get carried away with having the means to kind of buy whatever the hell we want.

New to minimalism,I've been interested in minimalism for quite a while but never really had the guts to take that leap. I'm starting off 2025 by decluttering more stuff than ever and I really feel like this is truly the start of my minimalism journey. I am so excited to own less stuff and have a calmer and more organised space. What are your top tips for someone who is just starting out? ,minimalism,1736543235.0

Minimalism and skin/haircare products,"Forewarning, if you aren't into skincare or makeup this post may make you roll your eyes and you can just keep scrolling :D - This is something that I have gone back to many times. I will see a skin or hair care product or be dissatisfied with one that I've bought, want to try another, or think I need some sort of new type of facial makeup. I end up with a bunch of things that I never end up using because I don't have the time or motivation to use them. I work in a fast paced healthcare setting where, in my opinion, doing full makeup is not only not necessary but will probably just smudge or get all over when you're trying to do your job. I've considered just throwing away almost all of my products, including the clay masks, most of my serums, because I've ended up with several that do the same thing after buying trial kits of some brand. Like, I just bought a murad dark-spot correcting serum because I saw it had great reviews and I've developed more little freckles and what I think is discoloration in a few areas on my face. I've used the serum for couple of months now and notice no change. It was $20 for probably .5-1oz of the serum. Not as expensive as some, but it just doesn't work. I think that masks make your skin feel better right after using them, but other than that I've noticed no real benefit to my skin. I have three different detangling sprays, which i do need and use every day. The other stuff I just get sick of sitting on my dresser, accumulating in other areas, and never really caring to go through the whole skincare regimen that using all of them would require. I feel like a good cleanser and spf moisturizer would be all I really need. Thoughts, suggestions, and experiences with this are all welcome. ",minimalism,1736623846.0

Is a Herman Miller chair worth it,"The idea here is durability and comfort.

Unfortunately, in my country, it's either the ultra expensive Herman Miller or chairs at a 1/3 of the price by unknown manufacturers. And the last thing I want is to be stuck with an inferior product that won't last. 

I'm getting a crush on a HM model called  Verus, relatively affordable and adjustable everything. Opinions?

Also, a standing desk. Those who have it, do you use for standing? Really?

If I buy such a table, I'll do away with the one I have, whose height isn't adjustable. 

Fact is, I'm working from home since 2020, and I either use a wood chair from the kitchen, with pillows for seat and back, which is a hassle, or I work from bed, which is slower because there's no mouse and a second monitor. Also, physiotherapists hate that position.

Making the jump from just a tidy person to a minimalist,"Ok I don‚Äôt know how to explain it better, I read Marie Kondo‚Äôs book about 8 years ago and it completely changed my life. It was like waking up from a dream and taking control of my life. I did the whole process over a couple of months, got rid of so much stuff and organized the rest, and never looked back.

But I was not a minimalist, I just became tidier and didn‚Äôt accumulate that much stuff. Yet over time stuff creeps up. After that I read a few more books on decluttering and minimalism, and honed better my skill of keeping clutter at bay.

It‚Äôs going fine overall, but I feel like I‚Äôm still on the other side if that makes sense? I‚Äôm not a hoarder and I‚Äôm tidy, but can‚Äôt seem to make the transition to being a minimalist.

Minimalism and ADHD,"A few months ago, I got completely hyper-focused on minimalism and started throwing away or giving away everything. I gave away all these art supplies that I wasn't using at the time, a lot of my spiritual stuff, decor stuff, clothes, books, etc...

I genuinely felt like the items didn't bring me joy at the time, but it's because I have ADHD and I change my mind about things a lot, and so after a few months, I regretted giving away so many things and had to spend some money replacing some stuff that was actually useful and made me happy!

That's why I think that extreme minimalism is not for everyone and not the answer to all of life's problems and definitely not the answer to mental health issues.

However, I created my own way of being minimalist that works for my ADHD:

1. Minimalism in the kitchen - minimal amount of pots, pans, and other supplies, minimal use of a few herbs and spices that work well for me in recipes, sticking to simple one-pot recipes

2. Minimalist skin care - I often feel exhausted and mentally paralyzed, so I stick to using a gentle soap and moisturizer for skin care and don't do anything fancy (especially because I am broke and have sensitive skin)

3. Digital minimalism - deleted most of my social media except what I need to find information and ideas, or stuff I need for my career (YouTube, Reddit, and LinkedIn), also set up time restrictions on my phone and the chrome browser I use

4. Relationship minimalism - only choosing friendships and relationships that actually bring me joy and bring out the best in me, and then I'm a bit less distracted and pick up my phone a lot less since I have less people to message now and the quality of my interactions has improved drastically since

5. Career minimalism - I am choosing a job that pays less but allows me the freedom, time, and energy to focus on what brings me joy..,it's a low prestige job too! It's great though because I worry a lot less now and have job stability. It helps me with my ADHD a lot because I can hyper-focus on what interests me and also have the flexibility to take breaks and move around throughout my shifts

How did you give yourself permission to let go of your past self?,"As I learn and grow more towards minimalism, I find it challenging to let go of parts of my past self that I identified with through my items.

basically i just wanna know how everyone else has managed to make it through that obstacle, and how their experiences went if you'd like to share

edit: i probably over exaggerated the situation more than necessary, it's all cause i'm moving too fast with this decision. even though i've thought about it for a long time, i didn't think too carefully about it which lead to the existence of this post, rendering said post kinda pointless now and confirming the fact that i've basically answered my own question. i suppose the point i made this was because i needed closure from others, which i certainly got, thanks everyone.",minimalism,1736751992.0
Third world relatives and guilt,"Can anyone relate to this: having extended family in poor parts of the world makes it super hard for me to get rid of things.

E.g. Right now I'm looking at a pair of shoes. I can't even remember if they were a gift or what, because they're not my style. 

Another example, a science kit that kids have outgrown.

Ok, so take them to the charity shop.

But

With the science kit I know that the charity shop will probably throw it out, as it is too battered. So I put it in the attic thinking, I'll do a yard sale/car boot sale, and at least someone will want it for free. 

Or when someone is flying out to the old country they could take this. Of course they can't. Their one bag allowance is for clothes and actual nice new gifts.

The shoes, I think: I could get ¬£5 for them, send a ¬£5 when someone is going to the old country. I never do.

Or a mug with a chip on the outside and which was a shitty souvenir type of thing to start with. No one is going to want that.

My house is overflowing with such things. 

I think, ok, do Freecycle or something. But it just feels stressful to coordinate pick up with a stranger. I don't want them coming to my house.

So three categories of things 
(1) Things which retain utility but are too battered looking to sell.
(2) Things I feel I should sell to pass on the money, but which I never do because it feels like too much hassle. 
(3) Things no one would pay for and probably wouldn't even want for free, but where it feels monstrous to put them in the bin/garbage.

Maintenance of minimalist lifestyle,"Hi All! 
I've been a minimalist for good few years now. Went through the ruthless decluttering stage, the counting stage, tiny living situation stage, clean black and white home decor stage, capsule wardrobe, digital minimalism, lifestyle essentialist etc., you know how it goes I bet. 

At the moment I've found myself to be much less occupied with all that, although the skills and mindset I've learned do help me day to day. I do declutter periodically, usually room by room, whenever I feel like the situation calls for it or if I have to reorganize something. 

Question to all of the seasoned minimalists: have you also found yourselves to be a bit less radical in time? Or the other way around: you're still counting stuff years into it with rigid rules? Or maybe you're lurking here still, but went fully in the other direction?

Functioning w/o social media,"Genuine question for those who own businesses, are active in the community, or are a part of non-profit group. Can you function without social media and still fulfill your obligations/stay connected to your community?

Context: I own a local business and am part of non-profit leadership in a rural, small town (County pop. 13k, city pop. 6k). We have no central source of information distribution aside from FB and Insta. We have a tiny, weekly paper that only old people read and all of our radio stations come from bigger cities nearby. Because of this, all advertising or notice of events and news takes place through word of mouth or local FB groups and posts. I would love to disconnect and not deal with social media on a personal level but I feel that it is very much a requirement for functioning in my area on a community level. Without it, I have no way of learning about what's happening locally or of spreading the word about my own events and efforts.

2. ~~Flip-flops are mandatory for swimming pools and public saunas.~~

For example, I don't make much money. I'm pretty into fashion. I'd love to downsize my closet. But, some of my clothing isn't cheap and could still serve me for years and years. Shoes, for example, have a lifespan. So if I already have a few extra pair of shoes, it'll stretch the lifespan of the ones I wear, because I won't wear the same pair every day. It can feel difficult to get rid of stuff when it feels like I'm taking a monetary loss.

Actions to apply minimalism with books and reading,"This year I have decided to focus more on reading than on buying books. I have been reading for pleasure for several years and have set an annual reading goal, which I have met well. However, I always get the urge or impulse to buy books (mainly digital) that pile up and I don't read. I now have a library of more than 150 titles, so this year I have set myself a challenge: not to buy books for a whole year. These are the rules of the challenge:

  


1. Do not buy any books until January 2026 (neither digital nor physical).

  


2. The challenge ends in January 2026, but can be extended until I finish all the books I have.

  


3. Adapt my reading to each situation I face during the year (my library contains books that reflect my personal interests: minimalism, lifestyle, philosophy, novels, literary classics, etc.).

  


\*Books that I must read for work or academic subjects could be an exception.

"Update: not really trying a no buy, just trying to buy with common sense - smartphone/tech addicted","Hello everyone.
I wrote about my struggle some time ago but never been explaining 

Wall of text incoming, sorry

Here it is:
I consider myself a smartphone/tech addicted, working with a mobile company only did me worst. In 2020 I had (seriously) 80 smartphones and tech stuff from all the eras around my house‚Ä¶I kept switching smartphone every day just to feel what was better. My house was a dumpster.
it was unsustainable.
Lucky for me I found an amazing (and pain in the ass sometimes) girl who was my opposite in this thing. I spent days -years to be honest- wondering ‚Äúif that iPhone was better than that Samsung or OnePlus, but maybe lg is an underdog‚Äù and she lived quietly and happily with her 16gb 4year old Wiko‚Ä¶
For a while I tried to convince her to switch and do like me‚Ä¶and I did it.
She switched for a Sony Xperia.
She loved it a lot and I was happy for her. Unfortunately she has been robbed at the beginning of the 2021 so she needed a replacement.
Lucky enough I was in the apple master program with my work, so every year I had the base iPhone for free. Useful to say that this did not stop me and I bought a 12 mini when it came out for myself just to sell it some months later because it was too small.
This to say I had an experience and my apple supervisor, hearing my complaints about it, just gave me another one for free, saying ‚Äúgive it another shot ‚Äú. This one I decided to give it to my girl‚Ä¶as usual, she loved it (hating apple closed ecosystem) and she is still rocking it today.

In the years I sold almost everything I had in my house, in late 2022 I quit my job and started to invest on my instruction to change my lifestyle and job possibilities. And it worked!! Now I have a corporate job and my addiction is waaaay better.

But‚Ä¶

At the beginning of the year I found myself googling about a new phone coming up and already paid the deposit for it, Then I cancelled it as it was really costly here in Europe.
A week later I found myself buying and receiving 2 smartphones.
This week I decided the best thing for me was to sell everything stupid I bought and send to repair my old but perfect (cracked screen) oneplus 6.
It can run a custom rom and be updated and used as a daily driver for my crazy switching moments, so I would not be in search of another one and not buying anymore.

Now waiting for it to come back.

I‚Äôm sorry for the text wall‚Ä¶I needed to say everything, I feel really stupid and I feel sorry for me and for the people who can‚Äôt afford stuff I was eagerly buying just to not use it.",minimalism,1737184669.0
Thrift shopping out of boredom / latent hoarder tendencies. preventative minimalism help!,"I think I'm a low-key maximalist with harder tendencies and I'm constantly fighitng against it. I Kando'd my stuff twice in 3 years due to relocations and it honetly felt wonderful, but I invariably re-fill my closets and drawers with stuff. 

I grew up in hurricane alley in a big house, my dad is a professional DIY type and artist, so there have been piles of home/engine/boat repair shit plus emergency supplies everywhere in the house my whole childhood. I was pretty broke from highschool until about 35 years old. I've bought 90% of my clothes at thrift stores.

Honestly going thrift shopping is one of my favorite things to do. It was alwasy a cost effetive pass-time, much cheaper than going drinking or killing time at the mall etc.

the problem is, of course, that I end up buying stuff. ""great deals"" they may be, but often times I never get the stuff tailored and I just take them to a different thrift store 2 years later. Or the fun / kitchy / weird things I discover take up space on a shelf and eventually multply and become clutter.

so there's the problem, You can purge all day but if the in-puts don't stop your still in a cluttered dump.

how do I break myself of this habit/hobby/legit source of fun? Everything else is boring. I live in the burbs outside of DC, there's fuck-all to do. Going into the city is an order and there's nothing to do that isn't exorbitantly expensive (yes there are free museums, once you've been to them all you can't really do them over and over for fun).

Maybe that's the real source of the problem, i'm bored as hell. Most days off I'd rather be at work becuase I'm just standing around...bored.

I'd love to hear what people do to stay busy/distracted.
(Please don't recommend reading, hiking, parks, or lifting weights, I work it out plenty, it doesn't help. I work at a library. I have unlimited access to books, I read a lot. still bored)",minimalism,1737215723.0
High-end basic: Struggling to find a seamless square-neckline tank top,"I have been looking for a VERY specific type of tank top for months\*, and the closest I've come is finding a t-shirt with the right type of fabric & seamlines.

1. The fabric is matte &¬†**texture feels like a suede or nubuck**. A perfect fabric is that used in¬†[Uniqlo's Ultra Stretch AIRism Cropped T-Shirt](https://imgur.com/a/58dyEbF).
2. All seam lines (neckline, hemline, tank sleeveline) should be a¬†**undetectable**¬†**fold-over without any visible stitches**. An example of this is, again,¬†[Uniqlo's Ultra Stretch AIRism Cropped T-Shirt](https://imgur.com/a/58dyEbF), as both it's hemline & sleeves have this kind of undetectable seam (but its neckline does not).

Change my views on exercise and its cognitive benefits ,"This ain‚Äôt a well thought out post and I need your input lmao.
  
After listening to Andrew Huberman and Peter Attia, here‚Äôs the general guideline they suggest:
Cardio: A couple of hours a week.
Resistance training: 2-3x a week.
HIIT: ~30 minutes a week.

My View:
Cardio: Based on the CDC, 75-150 minutes of cardio is more than enough to get most of the cognitive benefits from exercise. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily involve jogging or running, Type 2 cardio, like fast walking, is sufficient for optimal results.

Resistance Training: The benefits of resistance training are mostly related to boosting testosterone, IGF-1, and increasing BDNF. For testosterone, low and high levels seem to be the most problematic. A study shows that having moderate testosterone levels is the most beneficial for fluid intelligence, while high testosterone is known to reduce spatial and non-verbal intelligence. Increasing IGF-1 is beneficial for kids below the age of 10 but isn‚Äôt particularly helpful for adults. As for BDNF, most of it is produced during cardio. Meditation and even drinking coffee can also increase BDNF.

HIIT: There‚Äôs no unique benefit HIIT provides that cardio doesn‚Äôt, except when it comes to improving VO2 max. However, VO2 max is already highly correlated with resting heart rate, and training specifically for it won‚Äôt make you any better at cognitive tests.

Exercise offers several benefits, such as hippocampal neurogenesis, BDNF boost, and increased neuroplasticity, which are mostly achieved through 75-150 minutes of Type 2 cardio (fast walking) which most of us get indirectly through daily activities.

Resistance training can be useful later in life (near retirement) to prevent sarcopenia or osteoporosis, but beyond that, it‚Äôs not very beneficial, especially not HIIT.",minimalism,1737278134.0
How wardrobe minimalism actually affects daily decision-making - Data Analysis,"I've been studying the relationship between wardrobe size and decision-making efficiency. The results challenge some common assumptions.   
  
Findings:   
  
1. Sweet Spot   
People with 40-50 versatile pieces report highest satisfaction with their wardrobes, regardless of lifestyle.   
  
2. Quality Over Quantity   
Users with fewer, higher-quality pieces report 60% less decision fatigue than those with larger, mixed-quality wardrobes.   
  
3. The Integration Factor   
Successfully minimalist wardrobes aren't just small - they're highly integrated, with each piece matching at least 70% of other items.",minimalism,1737283338.0
"Minimalist Kids, Don't ","I see the odd post asking ""how to raise minimalist kids"". My view, please don't. Especially young children 12 and under. Let them have stuff.

But if they want something, let them have it. Just limit the number of somethings.

Does anyone else struggle to fill the void that consumerism held?,"I feel like I've been largely successful after a few years of rounds of decluttering, evaluation of the self, etc. I'm at a mental hurdle where I just do not find any enjoyment anymore in the accumulation, in the hunt, in the maintenance of items. Some might say that's a success story and I would be prone to agree. I do still indulge in luxuries but it's very sparse as I am not in the city as any of my friends so traveling is my only real indulgence. This is not a mental ever-presence that plagues me, but it does leave a hole of physical and mental occupancy I've not been able to fill yet. 

For a while I was making an active effort to stay off of socials. IG has been an easy one. I got rid of snapchat years ago. Twitter was come and go but with twitter and reddit, I find myself simply uninterested. I'm realizing the lack of value that most online presences have added to my life. In the last few weeks I've found myself prodding the dead horse of this subreddit less and less. Dead as in, it just doesn't offer me anything anymore (not a shade, just an observation).

I'm very much feeling ""lost"" in a sense of speaking. I do have hobbies and with all this extra time I'm hoping to get back into them. I'm fixing my sleep schedule. I just have so much time for introspection that is nice but sometimes the silence is deafening. I am really not sure if this is a flavor of depression unique to falling out of interest to all the quick-dopamine stimulus? I don't find myself missing my weekly thrifting trips or traditional social media anymore. People have my discord and my number and I like having only two closed communication bubbles. I'm just staggered and feel adrift with so much time.

Struggling to find myself & need some advice‚Ä¶ ,"hi all! Thank you so much for taking your time to read this and respond. For context I am a 29-year-old female and a first-time mom to a sweet little boy. 

over my life, I have been raised country. I live on a farm with my family and had horses, cattle, goats, ducks, everything. Once I hit high school, I developed a girly girl stage. I loved makeup, skin care, dressing up all of those things. And truly, those characteristics have stuck with me since. I have been obsessed with buying new make up and skin care items as well as new outfits consistently. I loved it so much. I even decided to start up my own women‚Äôs online shop. However, over the last year, I have really been craving a simple, minimalist lifestyle. I want to thrift more and instead of buying everything brand new and causing more waste get everything secondhand. Well, this really clashes with my lifestyle as a business owner. In my business, I carry contemporary western wear/BoHo outfits. I also have some beauty and skin care options as well. I do plan on revamping and providing only products that are ethically made, but I still have a hard time promoting my own business because I hate pushing the agenda that people need more more more. 

secondly, I have always wanted to be a content creator. When I was nine years old, I started my own YouTube channel and tried to create videos! I genuinely have so much love for a simple life, but also need/want to post about my boutique to make money. I also love things like Disney, Star Wars, reading fantasy books, etc. I want to post about those things as well, but they don‚Äôt necessarily align with a simple/minimalist lifestyle.

so, I have two questions. The first one being how would you go about the business? Do I still continue done this journey or do I completely revamp? Secondly, do you feel that creating content about all of these ideas would be successful, even though they kind of clash together? 

I am just really having a hard time having a lifestyle of all the things that I want. Thank you so much, I really hope I‚Äôm not the only person that struggles with something like this! ",minimalism,1737404495.0
The elusive capsule wardrobe (what am I doing wrong??),"In the past four years I've had two kids (my youngest is 5 months) and tried to get down to a true capsule wardrobe many, many times. There were times where I felt really good about it! But multiple pregnancies, weight gain/loss, identity changes, etc. keep putting me back to what feels like Square One all over again. 

My goal is to feel really good about the pieces that I have. I mainly wear black, white, some blues and blush pink, so theoretically it should be easy to match pieces. I also work from home and don't do a lot of ""fancy"" stuff so I mainly need casual outfits for when I leave the house and/or have work Zoom calls and want to feel put together for the day. 

Below are some of the challenges I am experiencing, perhaps it'll help someone else see where I'm failing:

1. I don't love my denim. Each time I'm like ""ugg which of these two pairs of jeans should I wear today?"" but then don't love them. 

2. I have some good ""basic"" tops but I feel bored by them. White and black tees, for example. Sweaters that seems too casual or boring. What I'm missing are pieces that still feel elevated and fun, my unique style, that feel good to wear out to dinners, parties, etc. For some reason though, I don't seem to buy them every time I end up trying to fill the wardrobe gaps. 

3. Related to above...a lot of my clothes feel ""boring"" to me. My husband is tired of hearing this lol. But how do I find something that has character and still will stand the test of time? I obviously don't want to go too trendy either. Often I end up shopping at places that are serving the lowest common denominator if you know what I mean. 

4. Since I'm not happy with a lot of the pieces, I end up feeling like I always need to ""fix"" this capsule wardrobe thing, but I then I get all in my head about the consumerism and frantic feeling that I need to shop to solve a problem. It's so frustrating! 

A big part of this is likely my desire to express myself through my appearance...perhaps now that I'm a mom of two kids there's a part of me who is unclear about my new identity. No more crop tops and skimpy dresses hahaha. 

Anyways, if you're still reading, thanks for sticking with me! 

I'd love to hear from others who feel they have successfully created their capsule wardrobe and they actually love all their pieces. Did you do it gradually over time? How did you do so without feeling like you always needed to be shopping? Obviously I'd like to avoid that feeling :)",minimalism,1737412819.0

Unsure if I should get rid of the whole collection, part of it, just the rack, or none of the above.** 

I have a pretty large CD collection. I'm a bit nostalgic about the medium itself tbh. I know it's much easier to listen to digital music nowadays, but I still have my old stereo with CD player, which I do use occasionally (not as often as I used to back in the day, obviously). 
Most of them, I admit, are from an era in my life I've moved on from - obscure subgenres, rare finds I was proud of 20 years ago, ""genre classics"" I just *need* to have in my collection - and I've been keeping them because they're part of my collection, not because I really listen to them now. (I was a total music nerd back then.) There are some treasured favourites, but most aren't. 

I recently moved and still have all the CDs in boxes. In my old apartment I had them in a large wall mounted CD rack which held almost all of them, and a few extras were on a small floating shelf (mostly because they have special packaging too thick for the rack).
Today when an acquaintance was over to help mount some shelves, I expressed that I'm not sure where to mount my CD rack as I can't figure out a space on my wall that would look good. Said acquaintance then confirmed that the rack isn't very stylish, that it would make the wall look cluttered, and proceeded to suggest I keep them in a drawer (and get rid of the rack.) When I told them there were too many CDs to fit in a drawer, they were baffled about how many I have, and proceeded to give some friendly suggestions which I feel won't really work for me either. 

I didn't come to a conclusion so they're still in boxes for now. And now I'm starting to doubt if I should even keep my collection at all. 

Here's my dilemma: 

- I do want to achieve an uncluttered look and lifestyle. I don't have any collections or sentimental items on display, the CD collection was my only exception. 

- I used to like that they were displayed on a wall instead of occupying space elsewhere (though I admit I hated the dust on them, but at least they're easy to wipe). 

- I'm not sure why I no longer like the look of that particular CD rack; it's in perfect condition and holds a large collection so wouldn't it be stupid to get rid of it? Why create a new task for myself, buying another storage for my CDs? 

- Should I get rid of some? If so, which ones? ""I hardly listen to it"" won't work as a criterion since I hardly listen to *any* of them. Might as well get rid of all and just digitalise. 

- Or maybe keep only a few favourites and, actually, put them in a drawer. But where would I draw the line? 

- And will I miss some of them for their decorative aspect (cool cover)? Will I miss the music itself? Will I miss owning ""rarities""? 

I have no idea how to tackle this and am so confused about what I want. I'm really bad at decision making in general (I have ADHD), and at decluttering specifically. Any thoughts about this will be appreciated!!

"I‚Äôve phased off all social media, and my life feels way more meaningful","27F. I have deleted my IG and FB accounts completely (obvi not Reddit) after slowly decreasing my usage of them over the last year. 

I read way more now instead of scrolling or watching a rabbit hole of YouTube videos. Even the videos I think are educational are just a time suck for me. 

Instead of looking through what other people are up to online, I am WAY more interested in talking to people in person and getting to know them better. Conversations are more interesting, I‚Äôm more engaged, and I feel so much closer to both random people I meet and talk to and friends I already have. 

The concept of human connection is so important and so fulfilling. I truly believe social media is hindering us from truly experiencing this at its natural level.

I highly recommend finding a way to phase out socials at least for a month. Observe how your perspective changes with how you spend your time, and how you value the people and world around you. ",minimalism,1737672386.0
Need Advice: Letting Go of What I Think My House Should Look Like,"I don‚Äôt like decorating. I don‚Äôt like picking things out for my house.

And I REALLY don‚Äôt like that I‚Äôm still weirdly obsessed with getting my home to look ‚Äújust right‚Äù

A little context: we‚Äôre a military family with 5 moves in 4 years and 2 kids under the age of 3. We just bought a house in a state I really don‚Äôt like because we have to be here and it was less expensive than renting and we are able to have some ownership and make it what we want (we put in new floors, painted, new fixtures, faucets, etc) and we plan to be here awhile (3 years counts as awhile)

I Stopped Buying Duplicates,"I used to be that person who always bought backups like extra clothes, kitchen gadgets, notebooks because of my 'just in case ' and ‚Äòwhat if I run out?‚Äô mindset.

"The reasons for clutter, examples. What do you think?","One is of course the hoarding compulsion, that can be present in varying degree.

In my extended family I've also noticed other reasons for overwhelming clutter in the house, that is not necessarily due to a high degree of hoarding (although it may contribute a little): 

- lack of organisation 
- low purpose for the various spaces

These two are interrelated. Basically, most of the items happen to inhabit a space with a very vague organisation, while many happen to sit somewhere without a practical reason.
E.g. part of a countertop in the kitchen has a blob of medicines, seamlessly transitioning to tea bags and teapots and coffee beans and related stuff. On the kitchen floor boxes with vegetable, pans, trash, all in one square mound.
Beds are regularly used for storing washed clothes and spare blankets. People sleep using half of the bed.

Also, old photographs that were taken out to show me 1 year ago are still spread on a desk catching dust, indicating a general lack of interest for the spaces, or the items themselves. Or it's selective blindness?

This didn't happen in one day, but was the result of ~10 years of habitation. My feeling is that hoarding is not the culprit, but mostly lack of planning for processes (i.e. trash management, kitchen procedures that dictate the sorting of the utensils, etc.) and clearly defined homes for each item category.

Do you agree with my interpretation of such a situation?

Would encouraging organisation help with the problem?

Does anyone feel like their penchant for minimalism is a trauma thing?,"I've always felt drawn to minimalism as long as I can remember (which is from around 14 on), and I suspect that part of it stems from the fact that as a kid I moved around a lot because my parents couldn't afford our homes, and was frequently homeless (whether in a shelter or crashing with extended family. I own exactly two items from my childhood because each time we would lose everything. Now, any time I collect more stuff than I could feasibly pack in an hour I get extremely anxious. I also can't form emotional attachments to objects the way most can, although I'm working on that. Does anyone elsebexperience that trauma informs their minimalism?

Things that require time and energy. Maintaining vehicles is probably the worst offender. I am mechanically inclined enough to do all my own work on vehicles. I save so much money doing work myself, but the amount of time, energy, and tools it requires is getting to my mental health.

What I struggle with is the value of service. For example, I priced out a differential fluid change on my vehicle. The dealer wanted $1699 to do the work, which includes a bunch of other jazz. So that was obviously way too much, so I reached out to an independent mechanic. They wanted $500 with labour to do a boiled down amount of work on the car.

I went to the store and priced out everything I need to do the work. $160. Literally 1/10th the cost of the dealership.

Relationship minimalism,"I haven't heard much about relationship and friendship minimalism and I'm curious if anyone else extends their minimalist values to include how they conduct themselves socially...

I have found that having less friends deliberately and being extremely selective socially has helped me filter out people who wanted to use me for money, favours, or to turn me into their 24/7 on-call therapist.

I have 3 friends right now and one of them lives far away, and this feels right to me, because I have more time for myself.

I also only really talk to family members with whom I want a genuine and deep connection, except for when it's a holiday or something and then I just send a ""happy holidays"" and good wishes message.

Not comparing my social life to others' social lives and not being on social media except for Reddit and YouTube has helped a lot with maintaining and enjoying this lifestyle.

I am wondering if anyone else has extended the concept of minimalism to encompass personal relationships and how its affected the quality of your relationships...

Why does everything need to be commodified?,"(Correction to title: [ending] to be of value?)

I just started working on assembling a recipe book of all my favorite ones into a journal, which I can then access whenever I feel like making something for myself and any loved ones or special occasions. I brought this up to someone, and instead of wishing me luck or feeling happy for my new endeavor, they made a comment about how after I worked on it, I could then create a digital/print book to sell it.

What‚Äôs wrong with just keeping something for myself and those that I would want to pass it down to? Why does everything have to be a product? I feel like it loses its unique and special nature, when something is overly shared or made for the purpose of profit as the end goal. This is an idea that has plagued a lot of my own past hobbies and sucked the joy out of them, so much so that I was unable to return to some past interests without feeling like I was wasting time, effort, or materials. Anybody else relate to this?

Maybe this doesn‚Äôt belong on this subreddit, but it definitely made me think of it because of the way an end product has to be multiplied and of value to someone else to be worthwhile.

[LF Advice] Redundant Tech,"I wrote a wall of text and deleted it, in favor of this summary. I have 3 devices: a gaming laptop, steam deck, and a gaming desktop. I love my laptop (Framework 16) and Steam Deck. I like all my tech to have a specific role in my tech-family, but there is now duplication of roles across these devices which has lead to me experiencing some choice paralysis, and thus stress, over feeling like some of these devices own me more than I own them in that they should be used/needed more often than they are.

Roles:  
Desktop: Gaming.

Laptop: Gaming, travel, work.

Steam Deck: Gaming, ultra-travel.

By this logic I could get rid of my desktop (which isn't worth nearly what I paid anymore) and my Steam Deck (which I adore) and still have every role fulfilled. Technically the Steam Deck is a more comfortable travel companion than the laptop for gaming, but I don't actually travel that often. This has lead to an inner conflict between my desire to cut out the things I don't need/weigh me down, and my passion as a tech enthusiast that got me here before I started the minimalism journey.

MINIMALISM JOURNEY,"WARNING: DO NOT THROW EVERYTHING AWAY BECAUSE IT CAN BE A SIGN OF DEPRESSION & VALUING WHAT YOU HAVE IS IMPORTANT...

Step 1: I got KICKED OUT of my parents house during the pandemic (negative view point). Another POV is they got me my own living space and room and board in a shared house. :D Where I matured and ""let go of the umbilical chord"". I was 15 minutes away and my friends were negative (made me feel kicked out) OR they wanted to crash and take advantage. SOME FRIENDS. I was 15 minutes away by car and anything I really needed they could drop off (outside of a blizzard or medical emergency or vacation). And amazon could deliver (outside of a blizzard). I had funds, etc. And I had only a few bags and boxes and hadn't fully moved out.

Step 2: Left the country. I left every one behind with just two suitcases. No friends. No family. No dog. No stuff. For 2 years. To help me re-evaluate my life choices, my friends, my family ( I went to their country). And to get perspective about USA politics (I'm American).

Step 3: Came back but to a different state. Went from NYC to Virginia. So, so nice to me. America really is huge. And while there's no place like NYC - that means the rest of the US is different too... I'm still in Step 3. But so far- the dynamic changed a bit. My friends still made space for me, but I'm ready to let go and grow up. My parents made space for me, but I am balancing being their kid and being independent. It's tough. But now I have a backbone, I guess!

And the toxic friends are gone.

Edit:  
Physical Stuff: My parents are finally renovating the basement as an apartment for me to have the best of both worlds and save some money.  
Mental Stuff: I have a laptop I enjoy to do online classes for a year (bootcamp)  
Emotional Stuff: I have a diary that I like

My favorite aspect of minimalism is the fact that I don't require much to live on, financially speaking. I technically don't need to work excessive hours in order to fund my lifestyle. It's also significantly easier to save for retirement. I don't care about career advancement; I care about managing my finances responsibility 
so that I don't have to be completely dependent upon an employer, which implies that I have plenty of personal time to pursue better things in life.

How to fight the itch to buy?,"Although there are a lot of guides on how to declutter and get rid off things, I find that that‚Äôs the easy part. I don‚Äôt see much on how not to acquire new stuff outside of: just don‚Äôt. I often find myself with an itch to get a new shiny thing, and it doesn‚Äôt help that a lot of my hobbies are ‚Äúthing‚Äù based like Magic the Gathering, games, etc. I feel like I‚Äôve trained myself to get those dopamine hits when I hear the delivery truck stop by and even though I do my best to stop buying, I still get that itch every now and then and doesn‚Äôt feel like it goes until a new shiny arrives. The feeling resets until it‚Äôs back a month later. 
I have tried some methods such as keeping a want/need list, adding the item to cart and thinking of pros and cons of it, etc, but they don‚Äôt seem to work as I still find myself with the feeling.
So, to conclude: any suggestions deeper than ‚Äújust don‚Äôt buy‚Äù, targeting the feeling rather than the action? 
Thanks so much for any replies!

Update: Thanks to everyone for the replies! It was a lot of feedback and I want to take it small steps at a time and picked the ones that I think will work for me. These being: 1) Maintenance and reorganization of the things I have. I think it‚Äôll help me find my appreciation for the stuff already here and 2) Keeping a Wants list and coming back to it 20-30 days after they‚Äôre written down to see if I still have a passion for them. 
A small note: although a lot of the replies are great ways to NOT buy, I don‚Äôt often. My main issue I wanted to tackle was the feeling that I need more stuff. I may be in a scarcity mindset, hoarding nuts for winter and I‚Äôll take some mental steps to help myself out there. ",minimalism,1738149977.0

Minimalist parents: weigh in on Yoto Player please,"We try to focus on open-ended, quality toys (and repurposing household items). Daughter is turning 3 soon and I'm considering a Yoto player. If any parents with a more minimalist perspective have one, I'd love to get your thoughts.

I try to be very intentional about the things we bring into our home. I hesitate to get into a system where we have to keep buying expensive cards to get value out of it. I guess you can make your own cards but it kind of seems complicated.I keep hearing people rave about these to the point where I feel like maybe everyone's just falling for marketing hype? Is this solving a problem I don't actually have? Is this the Instapot for toddlers? (Instapot lovers, don't come for me lol)

Pros are that Daughter loves music. We steer clear of most electronics but she does have a toy ""radio"" with 50 pre-loaded songs (Leapfrog Let's Record Radio) that has consistently been a favorite toy for well over a year. Yoto would give her independent access to way more songs and also stories without giving her something with a screen. I also like that the cards would be something grandparents could get her for Christmas/birthday gifts, possibly for years, instead of stuff she doesn't want/need.

In an odd situation and need a bit of guidance,"So my situation/life isn't typical. I haven't bought a ton of unnecessary stuff, instead I've inherited a lot. Historical items, antiques, pieces of family history, a silk scarf from 1790 (I'm thinking of having this one framed), handmade birchroot baskets from the indigenous line of my family, medieval chests, a freaking pearl crown, a sofa that was a gift from a long-dead monarch, corsets and tiny little adult suits for tiny boys (hand stitched!), actual snakeskin heels (I'm going to wear these bcs they're in my size), a wolf fur coat, a freaking mangle made of solid iron and marble, books from the 1690's-early1900ds, reindeer-bone knives, a carriage and two sleds, two heavy iron sewing machines, a SWORD, bottles of ""inkblack""(???), a freaking bull horn set in some kind of silver thing to make it stand upright (I think it's for drinking), beds that have doors on them like cabinets, wooden skis, an ENDLESS supply of copper cookware with little iron feet (they're in bad shape but could maybe be cleaned up), oh yeah a freaking HUGE loom, reams and reams of maps of the area from the late 1800ds through ww2, loose wood-framed windows full of bubbles (likely handmade), endless hand-embroidered sheets, ornate iron lamps, 2 HUGE tupperwares full of handwritten documents some of which have wax seals...

...what the fuck do I do? This isn't the sort of stuff you give to a Goodwill-like charity and I don't have the knowhow to care of things that belong in a museum. And is there any museum that would even want them? Most of them are at my family's old place and I just feel overwhelmed. I don't think I can take care of all this by myself, but I also feel bad getting rid of a lot of it. It seems wrong to drive it to the dump. It seems wrong to sell it. It's not stuff people who want donations would take. Getting rid of a lot of it would make me feel guilty too, like I'm betraying the family history somehow?

Hoarders in this community,"I have had several negative and rash experiences with sensitive, stubborn hoarders who refuse to accept it and start emotionally decluttering and throwing things out.  I understand it is a difficult process, but please remain civil and remember you are talking to human beings.  I know to get yelled is a common thing because you are  are still obsessed with your 600 dvd collection because its in 4k quality is but then complaining you have no space because you are surrounded by useless things while yelling at us is not fair.  In some cases they have basic items sitting in your house for decade or more and you still don't want to let it go, then it's okay just accept you are a hoarder and move on from there, please be cognizant of why you have chosen to post to r/minimalism.

If you don't want the members help, you can read or listen to works like Marie Kondo or other basic ideas as throwing things out if you haven't used.  A lot of people in this community are just trying to help and we receive a lot of ridicule and unproductive hateful comments because some people cannot address their problems without a flood of defensive emotions.

But, we have no skin in this game other than to promote a healthy living lifestyle mentally, physically, and spiritually, based on reducing to just the things we need and maximizing light, cleaningliness, and space.

Therefore, if you post here that you have an epiphany several times and want us to help you solve hoarding behaviors but can only respond by lashing out in continous condescending manners or berating minimalistic ideas, please understand that we are human beings and we can only have so much patience.  Understand we are just trying to help, and not everything is a personal attack.  (i.e. if I say it's collecting dust, it is not a personal but literal fact)

Again, there is nothing in this for us who are trying to help you.  If you cannot accept this, than please come back later when you have a better epiphany or post in a different r/ because this is not a platform to dump hatred to others.  Thank you.

Opposite of the usual problem,"My husband and I are a little unusual in the minimalist category. 

We downsized enormously over the last decade or so, moving from a stuffed 3 bedroom house to eventually a 600 sq ft apartment, moving 1400 miles in the process so we could live in the Sunbelt. 

But we always wanted to travel long term and decided to go for it last year. So we sold or donated nearly everything we owned and took off last spring to travel around Europe. 

We enjoyed ourselves immensely, but we ran into some roadblocks to doing that long-term. Mostly, the roadblocks were about our preferences, not our needs, but they led to us deciding that traveling was still important to us, but we'd prefer to do it for shorter periods of time and from a fixed home base. 

So after 8 months on the road, we decided to move back to our original city in the north. We arrived on January 1 with one suitcase and one backpack each, containing everything we owned in this world. 

We had to find an apartment, get a car, furnish the apartment with literally everything we would need, set up new insurance, driver's license, voter registration, library cards, everything you need to live in a place. In the middle of winter up north. While we both managed to catch a couple of the viruses going around.

It's been interesting, leading to good discussions on what we actually need vs want, what we can afford all at once, what's better to buy new vs. thrifted. 

Our apartment currently has much, much less in it than any apartment we've ever lived in before. We own far fewer clothes than we've ever owned except while long-term traveling. And yet, mostly this is enough. It's been a real revelation. 

So now, instead of the extreme minimalists that we were while traveling, we are now... essentialists, maybe? And we live in an apartment that is mostly bare, with closets and cupboards that are mostly empty. I think most people we know would feel sorry for us having so little, and yet we look around and see so much more than we owned just a month ago. It's disconcerting. And yet we still feel more free than we felt before our travels. 

I'm not looking for accolades. More interested in knowing if anyone else has been in a similar situation and might have observations about the future and how things might go from here. 

For the record, we're both over 65 and retired. ",minimalism,1738257625.0
Minimalism in Pregnancy/Postpartum Wardrobe,"Anyone else have this problem? My husband and I are such minimalists. Even with having toddlers we have managed to to keep a minimal household. My wardrobe was exactly how I liked it...until I got pregnant. Obviously my body changed and I couldn't keep up! Now I'm postpartum for the third time and all my clothes fit differently. My whole wardrobe is overfilled with stuff that may(?) fit me one day. Some is too big some too small. Just all the wrong sizes. And, like, I don't want to buy a pair of pants that will (hopefully lol) be too big in a few months as I start losing a bit of weight! 

Also, side note, on top of this my family has been unhelpful. My mother is very critical of the fact I have been dressing for comfort over fashion in my pregnancy and postpartum (I do tend to look like Adam Sandler these days). She and my other family members keep giving me ""gifts"" of clothes that are (1) not my style and (2) are wayyyy too small for ""when I lose all that baby weight."" 

Now my closet is overstuffed with random stuff and none of it really fits right now or is even my style.

Anyone ever been through this and can give advice?",minimalism,1738270748.0
Almost losing everything made me realize how I should keep letting go.,"This is more of a vent. A few days ago we had an unexpected leak in my apartment, in a matter of hours all of the wooden floors, walls and baseboards were full of water. We have to evacuate so they can dry and then renovation will start, they are planning to take around 1-3 months, and we'll have to stay somewhere else. I had to pack my essentials and leave, I'm gladly staying at my boyfriend's which is saving my life and making it so much easier.

I saw everything I own laying around, things that I haven't thought about for many years, clothes that don't fit, old bedding, all sorts of stuff that was just a burden, things that I had to think ""what should I do with this? where should I store this?"", and then I realized I don't need them, I need my essentials. I'm currently living out of a backpack and a tote bag while waiting to get more of my stuff. I put up a lot of stuff for sale online, trying to get rid of these problems. 

In the same week, I, who have been living in my country for seven full years, almost risked going back to my home country because of immigration issues (thankfully not in the US, but still affected). I almost lost my job, my country, my relationships in this place, my education, I lost my house for at least the next month or how long it actually takes. I have never been in this amount of stress in my life. And now I realized, holding on to things, material or not, will just make me suffer. I suffered for the loss of the routine I had at my place, the loss of being in my apartment, the pre-anticipated loss of everything else that I haven't lost. Now, I am letting go and I will continue to detach, detaching myself from things I was holding on to so tightly that the mere thought of losing them (material things, objects, routines, lifestyles) was causing me severe anxiety.

I now have much less stuff than I used to, I realized what is truly important for me, and what minimalism truly is; letting go of what holds you back, physically and mentally. 

EDIT: Thank you so much for the nice words and kindness. Our landlord has asked us to leave as the renovation will take at least 4 months, we are looking for smaller places. I‚Äôve put up lots of stuff for sale online and made some donations as well. 
Due to immigration issues, I‚Äôll stay 5 weeks to 3 months without work, this has made me put my whole life into perspective. I‚Äôll have a period of rest to take care of myself better and focus on new things such as my hobbies, learning, exercising. I‚Äôll live the simple life that makes me happy, simple living has been making me feel at peace. ",minimalism,1738270912.0
What would you do with old diaries?,"My husband and I are moving places in some weeks, so I started a big declutterring session that took some months.

At some point I found that I have some ""decluttering fatigue"" and feel like my decisions aren't that clear and concise anymore. 

In this state, I stumbled over my teenage and young-adult diaries. I kept them because I felt I had to keep them and I always think of my mother who said ""Don't get rid if your diaries, they will be important to you some day!"" - But will they?

I started to read in these diaries and found myself reminded of all the bad times (I mean, probably pretty average teenage stuff, heartaches etc.) and felt the long way I was coming from. But reading this stuff and seeing what I was and what I am now also flipped my entire day feelings upside down, and I did not feel too good and overwhelmed by all this ""time travelling"" and some ""what if's"" etc. I also saw how much I already had forgotten and I felt a sense of finding my old identity or identities, which, on the other hand was also interesting and helpful. As if it could help to stay young to remember the younger me... I don't know, it's hard to explain.

So, long story short: what would you do or what did you do with your diaries? Is it useful to hold on to old identities? Or is it just emotional clutter? Is it important to not forget? Or is the only thing that counts today and tomorrow? What would you do in my situation? Thank you for your time üòä",minimalism,1738271493.0

Decluttering Storage Unit,"Hey there,

Brief history: Lived in a house for 10 years, father passed away unexpectedly, mother moved in with my sibling in another state and I decided to live abroad with my husband and our animals for 2 years. In the span of 6 months I both removed all the unnecessary items unrelated to our new life from my own home and took in family heirlooms and memorabilia from my deceased parent and the other who was downsizing.

We packed ourselves into 4 checked luggage, 2 carryons and 2 personal items (read: our dog and cat), everything else was placed into a 10'x10' storage unit near the in-laws.

It's been 2 years and we've moved back to a different state and have collected all of the storage unit items and everything we own into our new rental. I'm severely overwhelmed with boxes upon boxes of memorabilia from my childhood, my deceased family members (my dad had a lot of his parents things), and more.

Can someone please explain or provide guidance as to how one's supposed to move through these items and get control back of their things? We have shoved most of the memorabilia and heirlooms into a room dubbed ""the room of requirement"" and I'm not sure where to start. Without divulging too much, we have quite a lot of family history we need to preserve for legal reasons, so I'm just not sure how to proceed.

Only issue, nothing I use has been changed in months. I‚Äôm a creature of habit and if I like something i continue to use it and then rebuy it when it‚Äôs out.

My dermatologist confirmed it was an allergic reaction and I have a prescribed routine to help the rash and block all the histamines. Luckily that is working wonderfully because I was about to scratch my face off.

She suggested, though she is not an allergist, that I stop using anything that touches my skin and slowly reintroduce things one by one. 

So I started with body wash and deodorant. Those are hygiene my non-negotiables. Luckily those didn‚Äôt irritate my skin. But as soon as I was ready to get to my skincare (moisturizers, serums, etc), I freaked out. I don‚Äôt trust any of it anymore.

Women‚Äôs clothes,"Hi everyone,

After 2 kids my body shape, size and weight has changed so much that before firstborn, in between the 2, after 2nd and couple of years after 2nd feels like a whole new person.

Until last year I donated a lot of clothes, really good clothes. Primary reason being , I had no time communicating on fb marketplace. Some of the decisions were not so right. I had some really good office clothes (Oxford and different brands) which might have been useful.

Even after reducing , I still have a big collection in my opinion. I can fit all the clothes (irrespective of the reason) in the wardrobe which is currently being shared. But I still feel there is a possibility to reduce. Which can create space (right now it‚Äôs fully packed) and also easier to find options when getting ready.

Drifted away,"Hello everyone, almost 2 years ago I moved to a different country, my lifestyle of course changed and I got into a very faced paced way of living. When I first got introduced to minimalism (2021), I decluttered my routines, belongings and social circle. Maybe It has been the loneliness or the way social interactions work in the Netherlands, but for the last year I have been emotionally spending, eating unhealthy and poorly, rushing everything filling up my agenda with things at the end of the day I had no interest doing. I remember how calm and happy I was when I owned less and when I didn‚Äôt fill up my life with unnecessary stuff. So I am going back to It! Simplicity It is, got a new room so the feeling of freshness will be massive. To conclude, I share this because I‚Äôd like to hear about your experiences and what helped you ‚Äúrestart‚Äù. Also If someone is in Amsterdam and would like to connect feel free to reach out to me! Thank you",minimalism,1738581013.0

Minimalist beginner,"Starting my minimalist journey, although I joke that it was always a part of me. 

I've been slowly decluttering clothes that I don't wear anymore. I joined a group online where you can basically put your stuff up and someone could pick it up for you. 

Everybody I have an attic full of stuff, And although it's not at a hoarder level, I looked recently and thought I could easily make this attic into a second bedroom if I got rid of some of these things in storage. There was even some clothes that I wore back in my twenties, and I'm halfway through my thirties now. 
Don't get me wrong. It's a flex to know that I could still fit in those clothes, but there's memories attached to them that I don't think are very happy. Ironically some of those clothes I thrifted so maybe I could give it a third life with someone else. 

I want to get to a point where I have a capsule wardrobe and look ageless, I want to make sure that most of my lounge clothes could also double as going out clothes if I so wanted to. 

In the meantime I'm saving every penny that I can, only time I spend is when I want to go out somewhere or to pay off some debt. 
*(I've got 10k in debt due to 2024 having a bunch of emergencies, but by the end of this month I'll be at 9k, If I keep this up I could clear everything within 10 months.)

Does anyone have any criticisms or advice for what I'm doing or what have you?

Looking for a quality convertible sofa bed for my tiny studio apt. Any suggestions?,"I love my teeny apartment, but would love it even more if I could downsize my full size platform bed to a twin size bed. However, my partner would NOT be happy with this change haha. So as a compromise, I'd like to find a sofa type futon/bed that I can use as a twin sized bed and seating area when my partner isn't over, and then convert to a full mattress when they stay the night. I've seen some options online that look promising, but when researching they all end up being scam sites. 

  
My budget is <1,500... maybe slightly more for the right thing.

  
I'm not interested in Murphy beds, conventional pull out sofa beds, etc, since I'd like to be able to use it as a regular twin bed most of the time without having to reconfigure it every night.

  
Any leads would be really helpful! I've attached an example of the type of thing I'm looking for. Thanks :)

Regain Yourself,"I think that we are metaphorically being attacked. It is our attention and wallets that are being attacked. When you listen to a podcast for hours what does YOUR mind think.

Balancing maximalism with minimalism,"I‚Äôve always considered myself to be a maximalist. I enjoy my little trinkets, and I feel comfortable when there is a lot going on. 

The issue is that I want to change my relationship with consumerism. I‚Äôve always been incredibly fascinated with minimalism. When I was young, I watched some documentary that mentioned 90/90 rule. Have I used it in the last 90 days / will I use it in the next 90 days? I think that‚Äôs a bit extreme for me, considering there are other things I enjoy keeping that just make me smile.

But I‚Äôm tired of just having‚Ä¶so much stuff. I want to live a life where I can still enjoy what makes me smile, but in a minimalist way, if that makes sense.

For example: I enjoy getting blind box figures. They make me happy. But I want to learn to get a single set and enjoy exactly each one and appreciate what I have. I am an artist so I am loaded with art supplies, but I know some things will never be used. But I‚Äôve always had issues getting rid of them because I know I ‚Äúmight‚Äù use them. Same with clothes.

I want to appreciate everything I have and feel like it isn‚Äôt me slowly just collecting and putting things everywhere.

The Minimalist Paradox: Marketing Minimalism,"The Minimalist Paradox: Marketing Minimalism

**The Minimalist: Less is Now** Documentary on Netflix sure was an interesting case study on how to sell simplicity as a product. I wasn‚Äôt a fan‚Äîit was supposed to be relaxing background noise while I worked, but instead, it pulled me in for all the wrong reasons... and let me tell you why.

Federal Reserve data indicates that the top 10% of wealth holders control 70.4% of total wealth (assets, equities, private business). Meanwhile the bottom 50% are more likely to own low investment assets like cars, or a rental house full of treasures, which snowballs inequity over time. The bottom 50% owns \~3.7% of wealth, so what exactly is the incentive for individual entrepreneurism, saving, or not treating yourself? It makes sense we are all self-soothing- the planet is dying, the cost of living rigged against us, and public spaces are consistently reducing their amenity, so content and consuming really is our only community. ¬†

I felt uncomfortable watching this, and angry at times that a lot of minimalism content feels like a trendy aesthetic rather than a response to limited resources. The ‚Äòguru‚Äôs' are these corporate guys, who have money, and are pivoting to selling an idea and their story rather than a product as this profound life hack.

It's frustrating, because there is value in reducing our consumption through intentional living, but the documentary doesn‚Äôt really touch on how to do that, it's more of a gateway to them as a product- which is why it feels inauthentic, like‚Ä¶ *who is this really for?*

The content was incredibly performative, he narrates this re-enactment of himself, unboxing his childhood- but only physically- not really ever making the connection that unpacking physical clutter is not a replacement for unpacking the emotional clutter of grief. Ironically, it feels like the whole topic is talked about in a way that is adjacent to his pain, where we the audience are criticised for consuming for the same reasons- because we are trying to buy the person we want to be or to fill an emotional void. I‚Äôve lost both my parents ‚Äì one of whom was a hoarder- so don't come for me, it's probably the reason why I felt so physically uncomfortable watching it. It's not a vulnerable way to contemplate mortality, or trying to help anyone, or latent with any salient strategies. It is a product too. 

Minimalism is a valuable conversation about conscious consumption. The more stuff you own, the more your stuff owns you. Stuff can creep up around you over time, and those objects become attachments with their own stories and memories. My top tips for minimalism so you don‚Äôt have to subscribe are ...

Top Tips

1. **SYSTEMS ARE EVERYTHING!** ‚Äì Clear storage solutions with labels (e.g., ""Christmas decorations""). Keep like items together‚Äîpencils stay with their pencil friends. If you have to move three things to get to one, your system isn‚Äôt working. My personal favs are Bunnings modular storage, the Flexi Mesh baskets (towels/linin), Montgomery stackable draws are so good for stationary or teachers - cheap and sturdy.
2. **Start with non-sentimental things** ‚Äì Kitchens/Linin cupboards are a great place to begin. Take everything out, clean, and set a goal like getting rid of at least one bag of unnecessary items or only have one set. Take it all out into a pile Kondo Style.
3. **Get the hoarder out of the house** ‚Äì If someone is resistant, give them their own space to control and create momentum elsewhere. Grouping items for them in advance can help, but personally, I don‚Äôt engage after that‚Äîit‚Äôs exhausting hearing every story about why something *must* be kept. Set clear limits, e.g., You have three full boxes, but only one empty box for keeping items. ¬†Done. Get out of there immediately. 
4. **Regular declutter challenges** ‚Äì Make it a habit instead of a one-time thing. I had a little bench top where I could go through everything while watching TV.
5. **Big goes First, and Small goes last** ‚Äì Once everything has a designated place, deal with the tiny bits. I used my garage to pile up the large junk and hired a van to do tip runs which freed up a lot of space and is the cheapest option. 
6. **One thing in, two things out rule**
7. **Prioritise experiences over stuff** ‚Äì Set ""no-buy"" challenges and reward yourself with experiences instead. Train your brain to get the dopamine hit elsewhere.
8. **If you don‚Äôt clear it out, you‚Äôll just keep cleaning it up** ‚Äì Reducing clutter reduces mental clutter‚Äîso no more rage-quitting over a stuck potato masher in the cutlery draw. 
9. **Cool-down periods on purchases** ‚Äì Shop sustainably and set limits, like I get to pick Maximum one item at a local market. Only keep things you truly treasure‚Äîdon‚Äôt hoard out of gift guilt. 
10.  **Sister Swap Boutique**\- me and my sisters regularly do a big clothes swap. Its actually so fun and I love it. We all get our clothes together in a massive pile and do fashion show then take the rest to Vinney‚Äôs that isn‚Äôt wanted.

Minimalism and my fixation on upgrades/efficiency,"I‚Äôve got one for you all ‚Äî how many of you consider yourselves a minimalist, but wrap that inside a cocoon of efficiency, system, and therefore‚Ä¶ an inevitable upgrade/swapping lifestyle?

I‚Äôve always been a fairy streamlined person. When I was younger and broke, I was extremely frugal. As my career took off, I‚Äôve always been mindful of my spend/accumulation and want to live well below my means. I try to keep my ‚Äústuff‚Äù to a minimum ‚Äî essentials and hobbies. I‚Äôm really good about selling old things I no longer use, avoiding clutter, etc. However, I‚Äôve noticed that my minimalistic lifestyle lends itself to create a bit of an upgrade culture. I will discover something that is an improvement on my current setup, and I make the upgrade and sell/downsize whatever it replaced. On paper, it‚Äôs a good system. But I find that I struggle more and more to appreciate what I have, the systems I‚Äôve created (which work just fine), and ignore my urges to ‚Äúoptimize everything.‚Äù 

Examples from 2024:
1. Had a small sling (3l) ‚Äî worked perfectly for my daily needs, but really didn‚Äôt love how it carried when I rode my bike (often). I upgraded to a 6l sling from Chrome that carries much better on the bike. My old sling worked for 90% of my life, but I felt that I needed that extra 10%. 3l sling was sold.

2. Replaced most of the stock parts on my hardtail mountain bike. Were those stock parts perfectly fine and capable? Yes, but I felt like I wanted to curate my bike for specific trips/styles of riding, and the upgrades would get me there. Sold old parts to a local bike shop.

3. Had a leatherman skeletool ‚Äî worked well, no complaints on function. But then found a model that had a better set of pliers that were much more usable for bike repairs, so they could double as a multitool in both my backpacking/hiking packs and my bike kit. Upgraded to that model and sold the Skeletool.

I guess my point is this ‚Äî am I alone in feeling that maybe I‚Äôm fixating too much on maximum efficiency/upgrading to exactly what I need for every situation? I wish I was better at buying the best thing first try, but I feel like I‚Äôm in the ‚Äúbuy, use for awhile, see what works/doesn‚Äôt, seek more optimized version‚Äù phase.",minimalism,1738907407.0

Office Supplies,"Hey guys, so recently over the last few months I have been trying to edit and declutter our home. I'm pretty new to the Minimalism concept and have not done a huge purge like ever but this time I want to make a huge impact and see better results. Me and my husband have art majors and actually met in college. (Interior Design) and (Game Arts Design). With that being said, getting to the office and art supplies have been a little difficult to me. I know we have double of everything and sometimes triple because we both got the same art kits while being in college.

But I'm stumped on a few things. How much is too much art supplies or whats a good amount to keep? I would love our future kids to be able to use our art supplies too for those expensive colored pencils, pastels, and markers we have but basically office supplies I'm trying to figure out what a base number would be.

Example:
How many highlighters should we keep?
Paper clips?
Binder clips?
Rubberbainds?
Binder supplies?
Water colors?
Paint brushes?
Notebooks?
Sketch pads?
Etc ....

I have an interest in Bullet Journaling too so I know I have quite a few things for that, but I know we have over flow we can donate or get rid of. I'm just not sure what a good amount to keep as a base to shoot for is.

Is Minimalism a Privilege?,"I just watched something that made me rethink minimalism. Minimalism is often portrayed as a path to freedom,owning less, stressing less, and focusing on what truly matters. But beneath the sleek, decluttered aesthetics and promises of intentional living lies a deeper question: Is minimalism a privilege?

For some, it‚Äôs a lifestyle choice. For others, it‚Äôs a necessity born from financial hardship. So, does the ability to choose less inherently come from a place of privilege? Let‚Äôs unpack this complex issue.",minimalism,1738961169.0
My Stuff is Distracting Me - How to Become More Minimal?,"Hi,

I been lurking in this sub for quite a while. I did my first konmari several years ago when I was in highschool- there was a couch sized mountain of clothes. Over the years I've been continuing to declutter especially since I moved into a 400 sqft + shed place a couple of years ago. My house is very livable and organized (sometimes I do put off the dishes but keeping all the guest dishes in a separate place has helped them piling up). I still have a lot of stuff, though, and it weighs on me especially when I'm stressed. 

I have adhd and bipolar and am in my last semester of college. I really think it could help with my stress and distraction. I'm always thinking about my stuff throughout the day (it feels like I haven't ever really finished decluttering or really ""committed"") and I wish I could get to the point where I just know why I have something and that it's there intentionally. I have a lot of guilt and anxiety since I have decluttered stuff I regret before, even though I don't regret decluttering overall. I think I'm going to try a purgatory bin in the shed again. My shed is full of furniture (ugh one of the things I'm a sucker for and some of it is sentimental) and it's supposed to be for my bike, garden stuff, outdoor gear. I want to feel prepared for life and like I can focus and do the things I really want to be doing. 

I'm really just wondering if y'all have any advice for someone who has a lot of anxiety about making these decisions and how to move forward. I'm not at a place where getting rid of all my crap is super urgent but it does bother me on a daily basis. (Which kind of does feel urgent but I don't want to create a new problem) I'm not worried about being the Best Minimalist Ever but I just feel like it's not quite clicking yet and there are a lot of ""maybe"" items floating around.

I'm also very anxious to have too much stuff or just keep it all because I can tell it's affecting me negatively. One of my grandmas was also a hoarder and we had to clean out her trailer. It was pretty \*enlightening\*

I would really appreciate any advise y'all have especially if you have a lot of hobbies or experience with how it interacts with mental health. Thanks

Last Push to Minimalism,"My questions for discussion: If you worked your way to minimalism, how did you make that final push? Since it‚Äôs a long process, how were you able to let go of those remaining trickier items? 

Optional Context on my situation :) :
I‚Äôve decluttered but I still own a lot of stuff (in a minimalist‚Äôs eyes at least). I‚Äôm working towards achieving what feels like ‚Äútrue‚Äù minimalism to me. The remaining items are trickier to let go but deep down I know they aren‚Äôt necessary and don‚Äôt really get used. 

Those include-
- a small roller bag that gets left behind because I‚Äôd rather use my bigger carryon for travel
- a nostalgic childhood care bears suitcase too small and impractical for travel
- various reusable bags and playful/casual backpacks that are cute but often left behind
- a vase and lantern I bought for my dog‚Äôs memorial that I now associate with him (unfortunately, because I already more meaningful items to cherish like a clay paw and fur jar‚Ä¶) I feel guilty not wanting the vase and lantern because I put a lot of sentiment in them when grieving.
-  a average, downsized but not minimal wardrobe of clothes that are cute but not worn much
- a chair I got for free that I set giant pillows on and a low table that I fold my day clothes on when changing into pjs for bed‚Ä¶

Any advice or tough love to possibly let go of these things that take up space? Yes, I full heartedly want to go to a more ‚Äúextreme-ish‚Äù minimalism, and I‚Äôm taking it slow, but would love to hear from others. :) ",minimalism,1739072349.0

Regular Mattress vs Thick Cotton Futon (Shikibuton)?,"Has anyone here slept on both mattress types for an extended period (at least months, ideally years)? How was your sleep quality and efficiency? Additional points if you measured your sleep scores before and after with Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, or another sleep tracker.

I'm considering upgrading from a cheap memory foam mattress (Zinus) to a latex mattress (Nolah Natural and Eco Organic Mattress are the main contenders at the moment).

But an intriguing alternative seems to be a 100% cotton futon. Why this seems appealing: no chemicals/off-gassing, and cotton is also good for people who sleep hot. They are also cheaper.

I'm not sure if I'll be able to handle the firmer surface though, so I'm curious about everyone's experience. And I'm sure I'm missing some other important context/drawbacks.

Some options that look promising:

Consumerism is exploitive and the amount of ads is insane.,"I was talking to an acquaintance about Disney World because he had taken his kids and was talking about how expensive it was and how it reminded him of Egypt, with everyone trying to sell you something and constantly being in your face.

He described the trip as exhausting because there were all these little surprise expenses,and he just felt manipulated and maneuvered the whole trip.

I had gone as an adult because of childhood nostalgia and had the same experience.

His comment about Egypt though made me think about how I already feel that way in normal everyday life.

I remember talking to a friend as a young adult about how I secretly thought that credit card companies were to blame for toxic work environments, because people in debt cannot easily quit jobs.

I‚Äôm starting to seriously consider transitioning to a Japanese futon/floor mattress, as I had an ex who slept on one and I actually found it quite beneficial for my mental health.

In researching different options I‚Äôve discovered that the bulk of reviews related to floor mattresses are written by people who have no intention of sleeping on them regularly, making the task of finding relevant information/product recommendations quite difficult. 

Consequently, I have a few questions that I‚Äôm hoping can be answered by some of you lovely folk:

1. How much should I be looking to spend for a high quality firm mattress? 
No frills, no fancy covers or fabrics, just a simple and durable option for someone who wants to experience the benefits of floor sleeping.

2. What materials typically denote a quality/authentic product? 
I‚Äôve seen wool, memory foam, nylon, cotton, etc. And without fail every one of these options are described as being ‚Äúbest in class‚Äù or ‚Äútraditional‚Äù. Please help.

3. Could I please have some good brand recommendations?

2. Turning off my phone during the day and at night. Leaving only a small window for distractions. 
3. Avoiding all news, politics and opinions.

How to stop buying impulsively?,"Hello everybody! Since I've been in the world of minimalism for almost a year now, I've been trying to have as few things as possible. Could this be minimalism?

Anyway, that's not the point of the post. I'm a girl who really likes fashion and clothes. I'm in a cycle of taking clothes that I don't wear/that don't suit my style anymore to a thrift store, and I make money doing it. When I go out to a shopping mall, I see an outfit and the first few times, I bought it impulsively when I imagined where I would wear that piece. After a few days, the feeling of having too many things came to me and I went through my wardrobe again, and I didn't like that piece anymore, taking it to the thrift store again and selling it for a lower price than I paid. It's been this cycle ever since. üîÅ 

After I realized this, I've been thinking better about what I want to buy when I go out. I have a wish list that are a higher value, then I lose interest in buying at that moment, but I would still like to have one one day. It's not something urgent, you know?

I recently returned from a trip and I have this strong thought that I want to save money and not spend it on frivolous things. I want to make this happen, but it's difficult. I don't want to stay in this cycle again, as I end up at a loss.

I know this is anxiety, and it is already in the plans for future treatment. I would like tips on how not to spend and not have that feeling of wanting that thing at that moment.

Anyone considered minimalism in the form of decluttering the mind too? Cutting out people etc?,"I've been thinking about minimalism. I started to think about how before I reached the point of wanting to clear my environment, I started with my mind. I did a lot of deep work. As I changed, so did my relationships with others. I started to set boundaries to keep my peace, to stop people draining me. These people kept pushing against my boundaries. My reasserting them repeatedly became exhausting in the end. I had no choice but to clear a lot of people from my life after that. Just to give my mind some space. I'm now at the point where I don't even turn my phone on and have deleted all the messaging apps. I also deactivated all social media and took my business website offline and decided to close my business. I'm totally done with everything. 

Anyone else done this with people? Did it help you long term? I just want some peace. Minimalism feels like so much more than just clearing the physical space. It's all that mental clutter too that takes up a lot of room.

# Introduction

A few years ago, I shared a post with the same title in Douban Minimalist Living Group ([https://www.douban.com/group/minimalists/?ref=sidebar](https://www.douban.com/group/minimalists/?ref=sidebar)), which received mixed reactions. So I want to be upfront: my approach to minimalism goes beyond what most would consider ‚Äúsimple living‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit reaches what many people, even fellow minimalists in this group, might view as ‚Äúextreme.‚Äù

I‚Äôm sharing this to connect with others who understand, relate to, or aspire to this level of minimalist living‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthose who have a high tolerance for minimalism and embrace both minimalist philosophy and pragmatism. My journey has been deeply influenced by Japanese minimalist thought, including Zen philosophy and works like ‚ÄúDan Sha Ri‚Äù by Yamashita Eiko and ‚ÄúGoodbye, Things‚Äù by Sasaki Fumio. I‚Äôm happy to share my personal approaches to material, mental, digital, and dietary minimalism, and welcome any questions.

>‚ÄúDan Sha Ri‚Äù is a concept introduced by Yamashita Eiko, a Japanese decluttering consultant. The term became popular in Japan and was selected as one of the buzzwords of 2010.

>‚ÄúGoodbye, Things‚Äù is a book by Sasaki Fumio about minimalist living. It discusses the author‚Äôs journey towards a simpler lifestyle and provides tips for decluttering.

I‚Äôll chronicle my journey chronologically from 2018, showing the evolution of both my living spaces (Part 1) and personal appearance (Part 2). There are numerous photos throughout in [my Medium post](https://chanmeng666.medium.com/my-minimalist-journey-a-before-after-look-2018-2025-80198180ce16) ([https://chanmeng666.medium.com/my-minimalist-journey-a-before-after-look-2018-2025-80198180ce16](https://chanmeng666.medium.com/my-minimalist-journey-a-before-after-look-2018-2025-80198180ce16)).

# Part One: Evolution of Living¬†Spaces

# 2018: The Beginning¬†

This was my minimalist ‚ÄúYear Zero‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhen I first moved out of my family home to live independently. The rental came furnished with basic items: a bed, desk, closet, and water heater. At this point, I hadn‚Äôt encountered minimalism as a concept. Operating purely on my own understanding of an ‚Äúideal living space,‚Äù I accumulated numerous possessions.¬†

Two months into living alone, I discovered minimalism, which became a turning point in my life.

# 2019: The Year of Material Minimalism¬†

This was my most passionate year of pursuing material minimalism. While I‚Äôm not typically a reader, except for work-related materials, I would listen to audiobooks like ‚ÄúWalden; or, Life in the Woods‚Äù by Henry David Thoreau and ‚ÄúGoodbye, Things‚Äù by Sasaki Fumio while cleaning my apartment. These two books became my essential guides for developing a minimalist mindset.

# 2020: The Year of Mental Minimalism¬†

This year, spending extensive time at home led me to deepen my minimalist practice, advancing into what I call ‚Äúmental minimalism.‚Äù I eliminated many superficial social connections, deactivated most of my social media accounts (including Douban), and practiced emotional detachment from others‚Äô expectations and judgments.

Mid-2020, I relocated to a different city for work. The move was remarkably simple‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall my possessions fit into one backpack and one suitcase. On moving day, it took just two hours to pack, handle the landlord handover, and catch my high-speed train.¬†

While there was only one perfume bottle visible, I still owned various cosmetics, merely organized rather than minimized.

For a more radical minimalism experiment, I intentionally rented an unfurnished space‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit came with only air conditioning, a washing machine, and a water heater.

Initially, I bought a mattress for sleeping, but soon found it too heavy and difficult to manage. I switched to a bamboo platform bed, but during the rainy season, I discovered mold growing between the slats. Finally, I settled on a foam mat.

This became my permanent sleeping solution‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa simple foam mat on the floor, costing about ¬•80 (approximately $12 USD). The center would typically sag after six months, at which point I would cut the mat in half, rotate the pieces to put the unworn portions in the middle, and use it for another six months before replacing it.¬†

# 2021: The Year of ‚ÄúMinimalism Plus‚Äù¬†

This year, I developed a new concept: ‚ÄúMinimalism Plus‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääapplying minimalist principles to various aspects of life.

For example, through ‚ÄúMinimalism Plus Gender Narrative,‚Äù I successfully eliminated all cosmetics and gender-specific items that society typically associates with femininity. I freed myself from both physical and metaphorical ‚Äúcorsets.‚Äù

This concept expanded into other areas: ‚ÄúMinimalism Plus Digital Identity,‚Äù ‚ÄúMinimalism Plus Diet,‚Äù ‚ÄúMinimalism Plus Exercise,‚Äù ‚ÄúMinimalism Plus Creativity,‚Äù and more. I encourage others to create their own ‚ÄúMinimalism Plus‚Äù combinations.

Also this year, when the education training industry in China suddenly declined and my career prospects looked dim, I found peace in knowing I had no ‚Äúthree debts‚Äù (offspring, mortgage, marriage loans). Being debt-free and in complete control of my life resources (time/energy/attention/money) put me ahead of most people, so why worry?

# 2022: The Year of¬†Identity

This year, I minimized my old name, legally creating a new one. I chose not to follow either my father‚Äôs or mother‚Äôs surname, or any family name from either lineage, instead creating my own unique surname and given name.

This act of shedding an old identity and creating a new one felt more liberating than any username change in the digital world.

# 2023: The Year of International Transition

After two years of preparation (mentally, financially, and in terms of material minimalism), I left China in the first half of this year.¬†

Yes, you‚Äôre seeing correctly‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeverything I owned fit into one small backpack and one shopping bag.

The plastic bag contained: unused sanitary products, tissues, summer clothes, and slippers. The small backpack held: documents, electronic devices, and charging cables.

Everything else was given to a familiar recycling collector from my neighborhood.

Though it was a triple room, the personal storage space was more than abundant for my needs.

In the second half of 2023, I moved to another country for further study.

# 2024 ‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää 2025: The¬†Present¬†

Compared to my first international move, this time I brought a backpack plus a suitcase, mainly to accommodate winter clothing.¬†

# Part Two: Evolution of Personal Appearance

# 2017: Pre-Minimalism¬†

I spent considerable money on nail art and manicures.

# 2018: The Hair¬†Focus¬†

This was a year of significant spending on hair styling and treatments.¬†

# 2019: Beauty Standards Transition¬†

Although I had begun my journey into material minimalism‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven challenging myself to travel with just a backpack instead of a suitcase‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI was still heavily invested in following girl groups and beauty standards.

# 2020: Breaking Free from Constraints¬†

This year, I began experimenting with freedom from traditional clothing constraints. I started by replacing conventional bras with nipple covers, but found them uncomfortable and sweaty. I then switched to wearing fishing vests. My final solution became simple: in cold weather, just a coat; in warm weather, a lightweight fishing vest. This completely liberated my chest area‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou can see the vest style in the following photos.

Though I had drastically reduced my cosmetics collection, I still maintained the habit of wearing makeup for what I considered important social occasions.

# 2021: Minimalism Plus Gender Expression¬†

This became my foundation year for ‚ÄúMinimalism Plus Gender Narrative.‚Äù Starting January, I successfully eliminated all cosmetics and dresses from my life. Subsequently, concepts like ‚ÄúSix No‚Äôs and Four Liberations‚Äù and ‚ÄúThree Struggles and Three Oppositions‚Äù helped me shed even more intangible constraints.

# 2022: The Year of Self-Liberation¬†

This was truly a year of personal freedom. I seized every opportunity to explore the city, often walking for hours in comfortable sandals without carrying a bag, treating the entire city as my living room.

# 2023: The Bold¬†Change¬†

Before starting language school abroad, I shaved my head completely‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääan incredibly liberating experience.

**2024‚Äì2025: The Current¬†State**

I repeated the head-shaving experience before changing countries for further study. The photo shows the growth after several months. My current hair solution follows a six-month cycle based on my natural hair growth rate: shaved head ‚Üí buzz cut ‚Üí short hair ‚Üí shaved head, repeating the cycle.

This cyclical approach to hair maintenance exemplifies how minimalism can simplify even the most personal aspects of our lives while providing both practical benefits and personal satisfaction.

**Conclusion**

Through my journey to extreme minimalism, I‚Äôve discovered that true freedom often starts with letting go. As women, we‚Äôre constantly told we need countless products to be beautiful, numerous possessions to be successful, and specific behaviors to be acceptable. But I‚Äôve found the opposite to be true‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe less I carried, the lighter I felt; the fewer beauty standards I followed, the more authentic I became; the more social expectations I released, the more freely I could express myself. I encourage you to start your own journey of liberation‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit doesn‚Äôt have to look like mine, but I hope my story shows that it‚Äôs possible to break free from both material desires and social constraints to find your own path to freedom.

I've just bought and renovated an apartment...,"... and I've bought more things in the last two weeks than in the last 10 years. It's a very strange feeling sort of splurging like that. I made lists and a plan so I don't get carried away but strangely everything seems to have disappeared into the apartment itself...paint cans, brushes, sand paper, nails, screws, skirting boards, filler, tape, wardrobes, sink, fridge, mirrors, shelves, lights, washing machine the list is endless. And it became all part of the interior or sort of. I've also produced a lot of waste in the process.

Now it's all done I'm trying to get my head around it. Do I just count one apartment to my possessions? How do you balance home ownership, minimalism and maintenance?",minimalism,1739621223.0

I followed the urge to throw away /downsize 90% of my stuff,"I‚Äôve been a minimalist for about 8-9 years now but something changed in my brain last year that made me want to just get rid of everything. And strive to become more of an ultra minimalist. 

7 mos ago I started aggressively using up the products I have, regifting, donating, selling what could be sold. Now I mostly own one of each thing. Except clothes I have about 50 items.

As a result, my place is so neat and clean. Weekly cleaning and tidying up went from 2-3 hrs to just 5 mns a day. Under an hour per week. I have much more free time now to sleep or spend with family 

I do realize though that this may be a response to past traumas. But it became so easy to just let go of everything. And it feels like true freedom not being influenced to buy. I have not brought anything new into my house except some cleaning supplies and food the past 7ish months. 


So as a message to those starting out, it changes your brain chemistry (for the better imo) and you go through levels of it but the final road is really blissful ",minimalism,1739656804.0

"Dilemma: Have been practicing minimalism, my old stuff doesn't reflect my current personality","I have been practicing minimalism and mindfulness in my consumption since an year now now. I regularly declutter and over the months I've realised that I've started living simply and a lot of the stuff (even clothes) that I owned previously do not resonate with me anymore. 

I wonder what can we do in such a situation? I've grown into a much different person and the clothes or stuff I own don't reflect my personality anymore. (I haven't bought much last year, most of the stuff I own has been bought previously). I'm also doing a 'less buy year'. Does it make sense to go and purchase few items which just feel more like me now? Does it contradict the meaning of minimalism? 

Update: I received a mix of opinions, here's my take- a lot of the stuff I owned previously doesn't adapt to my lifestyle now. I was a student back then and now I'm a working professional. I believe it's alright to buy a few good quality pieces that take care of my needs, not wants. However, I'd make sure I make those purchases mindfully, I will buy what I really need, not what I am being sold. ",minimalism,1739682686.0
The idea that you are not your stuff or must separate yourself for it is honestly stupid and harmful.,"**Title edit** ""The idea that you are not your stuff or must separate yourself **from** it is honestly stupid and harmful.""

You can be minimalist and love your items

You can be minimalist and love interior design / design in general

You can be minimalist and replace an item if you no longer like that colour/style

You can be minimalist and enjoy fashion & make up

You can be minimalist and love historical and cultural items

You can be minimalist and want a style change up because what you have no longer makes you happy

You can be minimalist and not be happy with what you have but know that some day your sacrifice of not having what you want immediately will allow you to one day have the money create a space you will love!

**Minimalism isn't about sacrificing your happiness in order to always have less, it is about having less of what you don't need so you have more room for what you love in your life!!!**

A personal example of this is because I didn't spend ¬£50 on a pair of crocs that I didn't need, I was able to replace my old skirts with nicer ones that I love wearing, were my old skirts still in good condition, yes and that's why I donated them but they did not make me happy or make me feel good when wearing them so I am not going to force myself to keep something and use it if it upsets me in the name sake of ""minimalism"" I am still minimalist because I still have exactly what I need and no more, one in one out rule ftw!

On another more serious note, people demonising the idea of having an identity in your belongings and blaming consumerism is just wrong, as u/choloepushofmanni pointed out ""Humans have been decorating our bodies to reflect our inner selves since long before marketing or capitalism existed.""

Both historically and culturally we have used material goods to showcase our innermost being, sharing stories and heritage through them, to deny this and in turn telling others to remove themselves from this way of thinking in honestly incredibly sad and harmful to cultural practices. I own a few cultural garments and jewellery from my heritage but I have made sure to keep it minimalist by only keeping what I wear and use daily or for special occasions. I have been told I am not minimalist because I own these things, that I should only have 8 black t-shits, 8 denim trousers and one pair of white trainers, like a ""real minimalist"".

Let people be people and enjoy their things, you can still be minimalist as long as you are conscious of the amount you own. We are all different and our needs differ too, please remember that something you wouldn't keep is something another could never let go.

Thank you for reading this rant, I truly do not mean to come across as angry or combative in my tone of text so forgive me if I do on that front.",minimalism,1739715212.0
"Minimalism, Family, War and my lessons","Original post is located [**here**](https://lukin.io/blog/minimalism-war-family-and-lessons) with photos.

In 2014, I decided to move to Kyiv, Ukraine. I had a great opportunity to work on an interesting project that integrated with the UK police force to help fight crime. When I moved to Ukraine, I brought only one medium-sized suitcase and a small laptop. At that time, I didn‚Äôt realize how valuable and manageable that amount of stuff could be. Back then, I hadn‚Äôt even heard of minimalism.

However, I was a big fan of the movie¬†*Up in the Air*¬†with George Clooney, especially a couple of quotes like this one:

*‚ÄúHow much does your life weigh? Imagine for a second that you‚Äôre carrying a backpack. I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders. Feel ‚Äôem? Now I want you to pack it with all the stuff that you have in your life. You start with the little things. The things on shelves and in drawers, the knick-knacks, the collectibles. Feel the weight as that adds up. Then you start adding larger stuff, clothes, table-top appliances, lamps, linens, your TV.*

*The backpack should be getting pretty heavy now. And you go bigger. Your couch, bed, your kitchen table. Stuff it all in there. Your car, get it in there. Your home, whether it‚Äôs a studio apartment or a two-bedroom house. I want you to stuff it all into that backpack. Now try to walk. It‚Äôs kind of hard, isn‚Äôt it? This is what we do to ourselves on a daily basis. We weigh ourselves down until we can‚Äôt even move. And make no mistake, moving is living.*

*Now, I‚Äôm gonna set that backpack on fire. What do you want to take out of it? Photos? Photos are for people who can‚Äôt remember. Drink some ginkgo and let the photos burn. In fact, let everything burn and imagine waking up tomorrow with nothing. It‚Äôs kind of exhilarating, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù*

**My ‚Äúbackpack‚Äù was set on fire at 4:30 in the early morning of February 24, 2022, in Kyiv, Ukraine. The war had begun.**

I woke up to the sound of explosions and rockets (the entire sky was crisscrossed with rockets and Russian jets). Immediately, my wife and I began preparing our bags, gathering clothes, documents, passports, and some cash in one place.

At the same time, I started doing a kind of ‚Äúafter-action review‚Äù (a habit from my software engineering background, where I constantly analyze how to improve some processes).¬†  
I realized some good practices, patterns, and habits that could be useful in everyday life. Stress can negatively impact logical thinking, so many useful actions or items can be overlooked. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to do the right things at the right time, later one it might be much ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù.

With multiple bags, our 10-month-old son, a cat, and a baby stroller, we tried to evacuate by train. At the time, most roads were blocked by tanks and active assault operations (including aviation), so the train was the only way out‚Äîexcept for one problem: millions of people had the same idea. The trains became so overcrowded that the only way for police to manage the chaos was to fire shots into the air (yes, like in a zombie movie).

We realized we were stuck.

With our baby in a hip carrier, two laptops, two suitcases, and a backpack, my wife carried our cat and another backpack. The air raid sirens blared non-stop, and explosions continued somewhere in the city. We had to return home; boarding the train was impossible.

That night, rocket attacks continued without pause, and logistics hubs and grocery warehouses were destroyed. Cash ran out at ATMs, and with the cellular network failing, cash became the only way to pay for essentials.

I realized one thing: food was running out, including baby food. Enemy tanks and aircraft were getting closer, and more roads were blocked. We started sleeping in our apartment‚Äôs corridor, following the¬†[‚Äúrule of two walls‚Äù](https://delano.lu/article/the-rule-of-two-walls-and-othe)¬†(which, as we later learned, doesn‚Äôt work well against powerful weapons). I also failed to find a gun to defend my family from marauders, even though AK-like riffles were scattered on the streets due to daily shootings or given by GOVs to defent capital.

I knew we had to try again. Thankfully, we got lucky and managed to board a train. I had never seen so many people in one place. The train was so crowded that it moved at 20 km/h instead of the usual 80+ km/h, and the trip took 20-25 hours instead of 10h. My big toe lost sensation because of the cold‚ÄîI stood for the entire trip without sleep, food, or water.

My wife stayed in the warmer middle part of the train with our baby, while I stayed on the stairs with our luggage, laptops, and backpacks. An elderly woman warned me, ‚ÄúOh my‚Ä¶ so many bags‚Äîyou‚Äôre in trouble. People at the next stops will try to throw your bags (and you) off the train to get in‚Äù

I immediately started planning which bags bag I could sacrifice first. The baby stroller was the obvious choice‚Äîit had no documents or money inside‚Äîso I left it between the train cars. I understood that my luggage wasn‚Äôt blocking anyone‚Äôs way, but in moments of panic, logic disappears, people will do anything to survive.

At each stop, I fought to keep my small space on the train with my family. After 20-25 hours, we finally arrived in Lviv, far from encircled Kyiv (though we didn‚Äôt know that rockets would hit Lviv the next morning).

We decided to go to Poland (I still think the Polish people are true heroes). We rented a hotel (which was nearly impossible to get because all hotels were full of refugees) and eventually flew back to Central Asia.

A month or two later, we returned back to Kyiv.¬†  
The Russian army had left the city, and air defense improved.¬†  
Sadly, we got used to hundreds of rocket and drone attacks, sometimes daily. This became the ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù (like a plan to go for a shopping might be canceled because of air raid alert or drone attack, or midnight ballistic rocket wakes you up).

# What I Learned About Minimalism:

1. **Before buying something, ask yourself: Do I really need this? If you can‚Äôt decide, the answer is no**¬†(works in any area of your life).
2. **YAGNI (**[***You Ain‚Äôt Gonna Need It***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAGNI)**):**¬†A principle from software engineering that I‚Äôve applied to life. It simplifies decision-making.
3. **Pragmatic living and constant audits everything:**¬†Regularly review your time, belongings (any things you have), habits. This has helped me manage my life and my family‚Äôs needs effectively. If you haven‚Äôt used something in 3‚Äì6 months, get rid of it.
4. **Choose multi-purpose clothing:**¬†Brands like Columbia or Asics offer versatile clothing and footwear for all seasons. A simple three-layer can keep you warm in winter and adaptable in all seasons or use each layer for each season, it can be worn for work, sports, and casual outings, daily basis.
5. **Digital over physical:**¬†Buy digital versions of games and books (my Kindle is one of the best devices I own).
6. **Grab-and-go bag:**¬†If you live near ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù (war zones, volcanoes, earthquake-prone areas, etc.), prepare a bag with essentials: passports, cash, silver blankets, water, protein bars, and essential medications (Check ‚Äòbest before date‚Äô monthly). Prepare it in calm times so you don‚Äôt forget anything under stress.
7. **Invest in knowledge, health, and relationships:**¬†Minimalism isn‚Äôt about deprivation‚Äîit‚Äôs about focusing on what truly matters.

# Additional Lessons:

* **Diversify your assets:**¬†Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. Having 2-3 passports, properties, and bank accounts in different countries is a smart idea. Start today.
* **After-action reviews (**[**AAR**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After-action_review)**):**¬†Regularly analyze your actions and decisions to improve efficiency in all aspects of life.
* **Create patterns and rules:**¬†Develop habits and workflows that work best for you, for your daily stuff, it saves time and reduce stress by not keeping that in your mind.

P.S:

Now, I can move anywhere within 30 minutes. I‚Äôve learned new skills, enjoy my Nintendo, rehabilitated a tendon injury with resistance bands, and play LEGO with my son.

The war hasn‚Äôt gone away‚ÄîI‚Äôve just adapted. I analyze the situation daily to decide whether it‚Äôs time to ‚Äúrun‚Äù or stay, but also find minutes to enjoy life.¬†  
Minimalism lets you enjoy hobbies, sports, and a streamlined lifestyle with just what fits in your luggage.¬†

Being a minimalist also helps you stay calm, reducing distractions and allowing you to focus on what truly matters.¬†

  
Stoics encourage us to actively cultivate gratitude for that which we already have. They recommend making a concerted effort to imagine what it would be like if something you currently have was no longer there.¬†

The Secret to Minimalism? Gratitude.,"I‚Äôve been on a minimalism journey for a while now, and I‚Äôve come to realize that the true key to embracing minimalism isn‚Äôt just decluttering‚Äîit‚Äôs gratitude.

When you appreciate what you already have, you stop feeling the need to constantly chase more. You recognize that happiness doesn‚Äôt come from accumulating things but from valuing what‚Äôs already in your life. Gratitude shifts your mindset from ‚ÄúI need more‚Äù to ‚ÄúI have enough.‚Äù

Minimalism isn‚Äôt about deprivation; it‚Äôs about intentionality. It‚Äôs about keeping what truly adds value and letting go of the excess that distracts from what matters. And when you cultivate gratitude, you naturally start needing (and wanting) less.

Anyone else feel like gratitude has helped them on their minimalism journey? Would love to hear your thoughts!

Advice for living with a non-minimalists,"I would like to start by saying I'm not a hardcore minimalist. I do my best to only buy/have what I need. I need to have a logical reason when purchasing something new. I really enjoy having everything tidy and each item has it's own place. I realized my anxiety went down when I started doing this years ago.

Now I live with my partner who describes his childhood as not having a lot of money. He keeps EVERYTHING!! He still has letters his ex wrote him when they were in high school.  (They were kind of high school sweethearts and got married really early. They have been divorced for about 8 years). He's 35 now. To clarify, it doesn't bother me he has letters from an ex. I'm pretty sure he  doesn't remember having them. I found them when i was cleaning. I want to share this example of how he does keep everything. He has several coffee mugs, but he only uses the same three. He also never throws away his mail. This is probably my biggest pet peeve. I looked through his pile of mail (with his permission). He had cards from his mother, and at least two save the dates that were never opened. One of those save the dates was for a wedding that had already happened.

We have two different relationships with items. At times it can create some tension. Is there a balance here that we can create? I think both of us will have to compromise. Any thoughts or advice on that?",minimalism,1739728224.0

Struggling to let go of expensive items,"Hi everyone,

Over the past few years, I‚Äôve been feeling increasingly overwhelmed by the amount of stuff I own, especially my clothes. I have a lot of pieces that I rarely wear, and I really want to declutter‚Äîbut I struggle to let go because I‚Äôve spent a lot of money on them.

For context: I‚Äôve always leaned towards minimalism and only buy high-quality items, which means I‚Äôve invested quite a bit in my wardrobe. I‚Äôve been selling on Vinted and have managed to get rid of a lot, but there are still plenty of pieces left. The issue is that I don‚Äôt have a lot of money, so it feels painful to simply donate items that still hold value (on average, around ‚Ç¨50 per piece on the secondhand market).

Another problem is that selling on Vinted means I‚Äôm constantly saving boxes and packaging materials, which just adds to the clutter. So while I‚Äôm trying to clear out my space, I feel like I‚Äôm creating a new kind of mess.

"New lesson learnt: Stuff is just stuff (not my/your stuff). We don't need to give it an identity, rather use stuff as just a tool to address needs.","I had posted a question in the community yesterday regarding my dilemma about adding new stuff and practising minimalism. 

I received two different opinions. Some suggesting I should dissociate my identity from stuff (absolutely correct), while others said I can add some quality pieces. 
What I realised is that many were writing 'your' stuff which made me wonder, well when we write your/my in front of it that automatically generates a feeling of ownership. While in reality, stuff has been made to only fulfill needs. 
Maybe you live in a country with tropical climate and are travelling to a region with snowfall, ofcourse you need to invest in getting some gear to protect yourself. For me, I transitioned from being a student to a working professional and my needs have changed. 

I get it that we shouldn't give into consumerism, but sometimes stuff is just needed to fulfill certain needs and that's what we should look at it like- a tool to fulfill needs, neither good nor bad. Giving lifeless things an identity and ownership is unnecessary. Now, I don't mean this in a grammatical way, rather a philosophical way. A coat is needed to protect me from wind, shoes are needed to help me walk comfortably. If the pair of shoes you have doesn't cater to your need, it's fair to purchase another fair. This also helps in not clinging to stuff, rather using it as a mere tool. ",minimalism,1739763214.0
Simple outdoor adventure layering: a lesson from Yvon Chouinard,"This post will land with a very unique niche. I am three things, perhaps in this order. 

1. A serial outdoor hobbyist
2. A gear nerd
3. A minimalist

In all of those things Yvon Chouinard and Patagonia have been a present and heavy influence. I have been a climber, mountain guide, fly fisherman, triathlete, trail runner, peak bagger, backpacker. 

The tension in being invested in a variety of hobbies lies in the accumulation of gear. I have always wrestled with this. To quote Yvon, ‚Äúhe who dies with the least toys wins.‚Äù

I spent a few summers guiding, and the director of our outfitter had a pretty consistent uniform. The most noteworthy aspect of this was that he had a matching vest and jacket. 

His was the Arcteryx Atom LT Hoody and Atom LT vest, both black. This struck me as genius and I have become an advocate for this method. A few advantages to this. 

1. Aesthetic consistency
2. Adaptability (I think an insulated vest is more versatile and can replace a fleece in a layering system)
3. Performance (if you like how the jacket performs, why wouldn‚Äôt you like the vest as well)

Only recently have I recognized that Yvon Chouinard also had adopted this method, as seen in the movie 180¬∞ south. That movie inspired my quest for adventure and my desire to be minimalist and die with the least toys. 

This could work with any product line that offers both a jacket and a vest. Nano puff, nano air, arcteryx Atom, Sitka Kelvin to name a few. I have found immense value out of the ease it has provided for me.

As you may have had just a pile of miscellaneous junk before you may now have a pile of miscellaneous junk and you now have a storage bin to go along with it not only does it become something else you own it also takes up space and costs money.

Digital video/audio project decluttering,"I am very much in over my head with digital clutter and desperately need advice.

A little about me: I am 29 and I've been making random little music and video projects since I was 14. I have AuDHD and over time I have amassed a ridiculous amount of files, some organized and some not, but a large majority of them are important in some way. I have a 2Tb hard drive that has about 1.3Tb full right now - some of these files are photos, but a big chunk of them are video and audio files.

I am an artist and musician, but I also have a day job and making music is something I do as a creative hobby. Regardless, it's my passion and I am extremely attached to the things I make. Unfortunately, because I work and have limited time to do hobbies, I rarely actually finish anything I start. I also have a bad habit of recording large durations of video/audio on my phone without labeling them, leading to hundreds of hours of unlabeled digital content.

My biggest issue regarding my file collection is that I have no way to assess which files are important without sitting down and watching/listening to all of them. I write original songs, but for many of the songs I've written the only known recording I have is lost somewhere within a random unnamed video/audio files on this massive drive. Additionally, I am trans and started medically transitioning on testosterone 3 years ago, so I have recorded a ridiculous amount of videos documenting my progress as a singer. These videos and audios are very sentimental to me, but I know they are mixed in with many files that include bad takes or multiple recordings of the same thing.

This problem is also my motivation to declutter my massive collection, but it just feels impossible to actually accomplish and maintain. I know I need to be better about labeling files when I create them, but I haven't found a system that actually works that I can stick to. I've tried having ""MASTER"" file folders, but then I end up making multiple ""MASTER"" folders in different locations which defeats the purpose.

I've tried automating the process by using the Everything program, using batch file labeling software, etc. This has helped quite a bit with my photos specifically, but the videos are another issue entirely. With photos, I can open one up and instantly identify what it is and whether it's important. But with videos and audio, I feel the need to sit and listen to each one and compare it with every other version to decide which is the best recording I have of any given song.

I'm so sick and tired of not being able to find what I'm looking for when I want it. I've made amazing projects in Audacity or Shortcut that I'm really proud of, only to be unable to locate them later. I've written so many songs that have been lost in the sea of files. I have no way of easily accessing my best work; therefore, it feels like it's lost forever.

Does anyone have any advice or steps I can take? I'm really resistant to an all-or-nothing approach due to the sentimental nature of my art and the fact that a mass deletion won't actually fix the root issue.",minimalism,1739808706.0

I am from a family of hoarders and I have moved out and after one year living Alone, decluttering some of my teenage year overconsumption. My parents have always lived this way but I'm starting to wonder how much I really need.

I'm craving the owning less but owning enough approach of minimalism, so I have embarked on my own journey.

So I'm trying to collect systems or rules of how much of what one person needs to feel like they have enough. I'm not searching a extreme minimalist approach because I would result in too much waste (my parents gave me lots of things they had collected for me)

The categories I want opinions on are:

Kitchen (plates,glasses,mugs,containers,waterbottels etc.)

Wardrobe when washing every two weeks (t-shirt,Pants,shoes)

Beauty products (face care, hair care, make up etc.)

P.S. I know this is highly personal but thats why I want to know what a normal to minimalistic amount of stuff is.

I'm also happy for tipps and ty so mich for reading till here.

Edit: Thank you all, so so much :3 your answers were really helpful and have helped me already and will help me tons on my journey to minimalism c:",minimalism,1739835826.0
What has helped reduce the urge to shop online?,"My goal is to appreciate the things I already have and reduce the urge to shop online.

\- putting items on a wishlist and only buying them a month later if I still want them

\- using apps that block sites like Amazon

Small Win,"Last night I needed to go to the local big box store for  some baby medicine, which is stockd in the baby section and requires me to walk by the clearance rack (my personal kryptonite, savings and scarcity triggers).

Embracing Simplicity in a World of Excess,"Lately, I've been reflecting on how much clutter‚Äîboth physical and mental‚Äîaffects my life. When I first started my minimalism journey, it felt overwhelming to let go of so many things. But now, I feel lighter, more focused, and truly content with less.

Here are a few lessons I've learned so far:

1) Quality over Quantity ‚Äì It's not about owning fewer things, but owning things that truly add value to my life.

2) Mental Declutter ‚Äì Letting go of negative thought patterns and unnecessary obligations has been just as important as decluttering my home.

3) Intentional Living ‚Äì By making intentional choices, I feel more in control of my time, my space, and my energy.

4) Growth through Simplicity ‚Äì Minimalism isn't about restriction; it's about creating room for what truly matters‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs relationships, experiences, or self-improvement.

 Anyone else here in the process of simplifying? I'd love to hear your stories and how you‚Äôve embraced minimalism!

"Drowning in Choices, Addicted to Stimulation","Ever feel like you‚Äôre consuming everything but absorbing nothing? Podcasts, movies, books, shows, TikToks, Reels‚Ä¶endless choices at our fingertips. You‚Äôd think having access to all this would make us happier and more fulfilled. Instead, we‚Äôre more overwhelmed, distracted, and mentally drained than ever.

More choices should mean more freedom, but instead, they create decision fatigue and anxiety.

The dopamine loop of constant novelty (scrolling, bingeing, jumping between hobbies) makes deep work and focus feel impossible.


Instant gratification from endless content leaves us mentally exhausted yet unsatisfied.

It‚Äôs not just entertainment‚Ä¶it‚Äôs everything. Aesthetics, knowledge, hobbies‚Ä¶there‚Äôs always something new, making it hard to commit, finish, or even enjoy things fully.

The Solution: Deep Dopamine & Structured Consumption

Instead of quitting cold turkey (which rarely works), the goal is to shift how we engage with our interests:
1.	Rotate, Don‚Äôt Hoard: Have a hobby/content cycle‚Ä¶.focus on a few things at a time instead of juggling everything at once.
2.	Delay the Hit: Before starting a new book, hobby, or show, wait 24 hours. If you still care, go for it. This filters out impulsive consumption.
3.	Consume Less, Create More: If you love aesthetics, make mood boards. If you love knowledge, summarize what you learn. Creating deepens engagement.
4.	Introduce Friction: Physical books over digital. Desktop YouTube instead of the app. Small barriers make consumption more mindful.
5.	Prioritize Completion: Your brain loves novelty‚Ä¶train it to love finishing instead of just starting. No new hobby or book until you complete the last one.


We‚Äôre not meant to process infinite choices. The key isn‚Äôt shutting out curiosity‚Ä¶it‚Äôs channeling it into things that actually fulfill us. Less dopamine chasing, more depth and presence.

Remember you can do anything but not everything. ",minimalism,1739928784.0
How do you stop the urge to acquire pretty/aesthetic but useless things?,"I've gotten pretty good with not buying more than I need in most areas of life, but I still have a major issue with pretty or aesthetic things, when I see them I get this overwhelming urge to have them and put them in my space, put them on me, etc.

What has minimalism helped you prioritize?,"While making my most recent evacuation checklist, I realized that all of the ""extraneous"" (ie not hygiene/clothes/laptop and phone) things I would take with me fall into three categories:
- Hiking/camping (hammock, quilts, tarp/bugnet)
- Crafting (sewing kit, needles/hooks)
- Shortlist of books of sentimental value

Minimalism's been great because, in cutting out all of the clutter, I'm able to physically access the resources to make the things I enjoy doing feel more accessible when I have a free moment, plus emotionally it's easier to say, ""I have a free moment, what should I do?"" and pick from one of the things I actually enjoy (rather than some distraction to pass the time).

Advice for the aspiring minimalist,"For those of you who decided to sell some of your items in the process of decluttering, how did you (emotionally and mentally) let the stuff go?

Current dilemma: I decided I wanted to sell a few things online. I‚Äôve priced everything (imo) reasonably and fairly. But as most selling online platforms, people tend to haggle. For example something going for 5, someone wants for 3 (worth 20), something selling for 130, someone wants for 70 (paid 260). 

I guess I‚Äôm wondering would you just let anything go for any price just to get rid of it or wait it out?

I am torn between keeping my new soundbar or spending 2x and getting a pair of bookshelf speakers and a dedicated AVR.,"I love the design and look of my new Sony Soundbar I bought yesterday.

I'm hearing stuff I never really noticed before,and I don't know if changing to dedicated bookshelf speakers will be a downgrade since soundbar technology is always improving.

I'm listening to a few CDs again and it's a new experience (not just deeper bass), but new layers or subtle things that I never heard before. The Bluetooth function works but all my FLAC tracks sound like garbage through the soundbar.

I haven't tried a Blu-ray with True HD/DTS audio, but I suspect I will be blown away. It's too late to test out with movies with a good score or action like Dune 1/2 or The Dark Knight.

I think my current minimalist lifestyle shows some signs of regression. When I first flew to New Zealand, I only brought a backpack and a suitcase. Now after living here for several months, if I were to move again, I'd need an extra bag. I still want to simplify further - if the landlord would allow me to do laundry every day, I could minimize my clothes to just two sets.

The peak of my minimalist life was when I lived in that empty room in Nanning. In 2020, I specifically sought out a completely empty room without bed or cabinets. The landlord intended it as an office space - she didn't expect anyone would rent it to live in. After I moved in, she only installed a water heater, washing machine, and air conditioner. No other furniture or appliances.

All my storage was in shopping bags - one for clothes, one for sanitary pads and toilet paper, another for pots and miscellaneous items. I slept on a foam pad that cost about 80 yuan. After six months, I would cut it in half and join the unworn sides, which would last another half year. I even made a sofa from discarded foam pads.

The foam pad let me live like a plant, freely following the sun's path. When sunlight shone on the left side of the room, I would carry the pad there. When it moved right, I followed. At night, I could move to where moonlight came in - just lying there, watching the moon. It was quite satisfying.

My minimalist journey started differently though. My first solo apartment was filled with Instagram-worthy decorations - LED strips, wall art, plants, designer items. I even spent 99 yuan on a trash can just because it was pure white and looked stylish. With my modest salary, this quickly became unsustainable.

The turning point came when I threw away some broken charging cables. That moment showed me I could start with small things - broken hair clips, dirty soap holders, items that weren't painful to discard. Soon, I was inspecting my space like reviewing troops: decorative frames collecting dust, unused couch taking space, expensive plants hiding cockroaches - all could go.

I became increasingly practical. In the kitchen, I realized I only needed oil, salt, and soy sauce. My approach to food is purely nutritional - rice and noodles both count as carbohydrates, so one is enough. Meat contains protein and fat, so if I eat meat, I don't need milk. Now abroad, this practicality significantly reduces my expenses.

The process of discarding became addictive. Each item removed brought more fresh air and sunlight into my space, matching my aesthetic of ""emptiness as beauty."" This extended to my appearance too - I threw away dresses and makeup, shaved my head, and focused on practical clothing made of materials like polar fleece, coral fleece, and polyester. These fabrics are quick-drying, warm, windproof, wrinkle-resistant, and inexpensive. I find these more practical than materials like cotton, linen, or silk that require special care or take long to dry.

Eventually, this mindset expanded beyond physical items. I reduced social connections, keeping only current, meaningful ones. I even legally changed my name at 30, creating an identity free from past associations. I found that minimizing physical distance from certain relationships actually improved them - like with my mother, whom I now see once a year instead of living together in constant conflict.

I've learned that minimalism requires talent, but it's also a skill that can be trained. The moment you start throwing things away, you gain experience and develop new perspectives. Once the idea of discarding something enters your mind, that item becomes increasingly unsightly until you remove it.

Now, I focus solely on the present moment. I consider whether things, people, or ideas are useful to me right now. If they're not immediately useful, they should go. This applies to everything - from physical objects to relationships to anxieties about the future.

I don't particularly recommend my approach to others. This is simply my experience of finding what works for me. When someone tells me they want to buy a book about minimalism after hearing my story, I find it ironic - buying new things to learn about having less. I just suggest they try audiobooks instead.

"just disgusted with how much electronical shit i have; thousands of photos and emails and multiple email addresses and just useless apps and accounts, its almost as stressful as physical clutter","VENT POST not even really important just my experience in my minimalist path.

\-

i always get so manic a few times a year; i managed to give away my old books ive already gone through and donate them and clothes and reuse shit and then toss em, after multiple years ive cut down my possessions to the point where i could basically stuff all my shit in my SUV, minus furniture of course. im glad i have less crap, i really dont need all that. thinking about owning knick knacks or being in a house that's just so convuluted and filled with so much shit is so stressful. nobody needs to own that much or consume that much. 

  
after cutting down and only keeping the very very necessary stuff (and a box of sentimentals), my mind went to digital clutter and god. its just so gross. i feel sick just thinking about it. i know its not the same, like i can turn off my shit and have it disappear but its THERE. its still THERE. whenever i turn on a device i know that in the gallery or folders or logging in via google that im entering a space where i have so much unneccesary things. its like more stressful bc most of the photos i have in my gallery are MEMES. literal memes. thousands of memes from during lockdown. stupid screenshots of dumb ass conversations; i dont even remember why i still have them im a fucking adult now i dont need to have screenshots of ancient group chats or these outdated ass memes, and so many of my photos are just blurry?? like my gallery is meant to be a GALLERY. not a dump. im envious of those who can just open up their gallery and be NORMAL. like maybe have screenshots of a schedule or an appointment or a receipt, selfies with the family/SO/friends, like how a gallery should be. like i have hundreds of screenshots from a tv show i used to be obsessed with LIKE WHYYY. HUNDREDS of photos i have to sift through. i still have screenshots of news from the obama adminsitration like i screenshotted that in middle school and I STILL have the screenshots. its not like owning a damn newspaper of the news which i could see how its sentimental but this is literally just PIXELS and im just so URGGGGh. im off tomorrow so im planning on completely fixing this. and its not just the tens of thousands of irrelevant photos, its also the tens of thousands of EMAILS i have to sift through. the multiple addresses. the social media clutter. 

oh and it isnt just my gallery too. i had autosave on so apparently i also have this clutter in my icloud storage as WELL as google photos like HOORAY FOR ME. if i wanna see a photo of me and my friend just to remember fond memories i dont want to have to like deal with all that. like in order to find a crucial photo i scroll the bar on the side ok ok... 2017... march 2017 ok... ok good i know its in march great... but jesus christ, of course, march has hundreds and hundreds of pop culture screenshots... great. and yeah i know i can search but sometimes they dont have words or sometimes i dont know exactly what they say and even if i type in a keyword, again, thousands of images with that word will show up. wont help at all.

I'm only a minimalist is because junk is stressful,"While as I appreciate those of you who are minimalist for more high-minded reasons, I personally get unreasonably stressed when there's too much stuff.Yes, minimalism improves the functionality of my space but it's more than that. Needing to go through junk or even just looking at it makes me anxious, and having to keep it all clean and organized is such a chore. 

Like many of us, I grew up in a cluttered home where things that were ""still good"" couldn't possibly be thrown out/donated. Especially if it was expensive!Getting over that mindset was hard but worth it. It's freeing, right? I don't want to rifle through my C-list clothes to find something I will actually feel good in or have my vanity covered in products that I don't use. Finally clearing it all out felt like someone turned off the strobe light and turned down the music. Only having my favorite things is so peaceful. ",minimalism,1740453260.0

"Fake ""Relatable moment"" is anything but Minimalism","For the last few months I have been browsing this subreddit to connect to people's version of minimalism and how the only convention that truly exists in minimalism is no convention at all. Apparently, can't do that anymore.

The [comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/1ixeva8/realized_my_minimalism_had_become_another_form_of/melxncd/) by u/Fly-Astronaut also seem to be a perfectly normal comment which unfortunately people do these days, i.e. talk to a chatbot as form of Therapy.

The sad part about that is, these two accounts are carefully designing their posts, most likely with help of a chatbot and putting it here and dropping their own chatbot in disguise of helping deal with complex thoughts. 

As someone who works in the field of chatbots and social good and embraces the idea of minimalism, I can not begin to describe the disgust their veiled effort brings to my being. I am extremely optimistic, and like to see the good in people, but this is where I draw the line.

I also have sold 100+ items since the last two years of my office style pre-covid and finally my closet is SO clean and i adore it.

Heres my issue: I have these two pants that are my go to pants in grey and black and go with everything. I go online to order the same style size in the navy blue, bc 5 days a week is alot and I figure an extra pair wont hurt?

anyways, well, it arrives and i guess the manufacterer messed with sizing bc its legit way bigger in the waist, the cut looks slightly bigger, and the one i order from a few yrs ago fit way better! 

I am devastated they messed with the style! now my paranoia is kicking in, what if the pair i have  (esp the grey one, its my fav and now discontinued color!) gets messed up, torn, or worn out in the 5 days work week, what if I spill my lunch on it, clearly its limited edition and my paranoia is coming on to buy one backup on ebay, bc its my favorite pant and I am terrified. Then i start to think what if i gain weight, then i have no use for it- but then if i gain weight I can sell on ebay. 

Do any of you feel this way? what do you do and how to deal? i feel i am this way more about pants/skirts bc my proportions are hard to fit? btw we are talking about 30$ total.",minimalism,1740535854.0

Question about Shikibuton Futon materials,"This community seems to have a lot of posts about futons, so I‚Äôll try asking here:

Looking to get a futon and going in circles trying to decide on an ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù Japanese shikibuton made of all cotton, vs. a futon made of synthetic materials.

I‚Äôm OK with paying money for quality, but my main question is this: Is there anything inherently ‚Äúbetter‚Äù about a shikibuton made in the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù and ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù Japanese way using tight knit, all natural cotton fibers, vs. a more ‚Äúmodern‚Äù futon using a combination of ‚Äúspace age‚Äù materials, like polyester, foam, latex, etc?

It seems like traditional shikibuton have issues with lumping, and need a lot of care and maintenance, and are expensive, whereas I‚Äôm not sure what the downside of synthetic materials is besides not being ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù and ‚Äútraditional‚Äù.  Is it concerns about off-gassing and VOCs and destroying the planet?  Is it breathability?  Is it deterioration or flattening over time?  All of the above?",minimalism,1740545254.0

What misunderstandings have you faced because of minimalism?,"When I first started practicing minimalism, people often assumed that it meant I was just trying to save money, so they thought I was cheap or didn‚Äôt care about quality.

I sold all my stuff including house and expensive cars, got out of debt and only buy things that are essential to my life and usually when I buy something, something I already own has to leave. Honestly I never thought not having a lot could make me this happy but the peace I have is way more important than what people think. I could not be more grateful for this lifestyle.

Practical minimalistic wandrobe,"""Hello everyone. I'm still quite inexperienced when it comes to minimalism and I'm facing a problem. I come from a poor family and over the years I've accumulated a lot of clothing. 80% of it was gifted to me by relatives and friends who didn't need the items anymore. Unfortunately, I still have the mentality that I might need these things someday or should keep them for harder times. As a result, my wardrobe is very crowded and I'm losing track of what I have. All this stuff is also weighing on my mind and I feel like I never have peace of mind. Every time I try to declutter, I wonder about the criteria for sorting out clothing. Quality/brand of clothing? Basics? Practicality? I don't want to only wear black, white, and beige, but I also know it doesn't make sense to have clothing in my wardrobe that I can't combine in the end. How have you managed this? How many clothing items do you have? Which clothing items have proven to be useful for you?

How about if you own 2 or 3 weeks of clothing? It's obvious how often you have to do laundry with different amounts of clothes, but I don't have a sense of how fast things wear out when you don't have much and are constantly washing the same things over and over. I like the idea of a minimal wardrobe and I'm definitely downsizing from where I started, but I don't want to go so far that I have to go shopping and replace things constantly.

Let‚Äôs share! Irritating ways people try to ‚Äúget you‚Äù,"I‚Äôve been thinking of this all day because my mom is coming shopping with me tomorrow (I do know about the economic blackout but I genuinely need 2-3 new tops for work, I‚Äôve just gotten a new job and only have appropriate winter clothes, we are thrifting first)

Every winter/around the holidays my mom buys yet another jacket. I‚Äôve learned there‚Äôs no converting to be done there, so she shows me and I tell her it looks nice, I like the color, the pockets seem roomy and useful, whatever. Without fail my parents jump on that and urge me to ask for the same coat for Christmas because they don‚Äôt think I have a nice coat.

I have 2 coats (probably seems excessive to some here, but it‚Äôs bad to wash them too often). I have a brown coat for doing outdoorsy things with my dog, it‚Äôs always covered in paw prints and burrs. I have a blue coat for going to work and social events (hopefully doesn‚Äôt smell like dog).

So I‚Äôll remind them I have 2 coats and one is meant to be nice, one is not. And that‚Äôs plenty for me, more than enough for most people. Then they say ‚Äúoh wait aren‚Äôt you a minimalist??‚Äù Or they try to argue with me the brown one is nice (?) though the premise is that I don‚Äôt have any nice coats.

Minimalizing with kids?,"Hello! I recently looked around my cluttered house and realized that I need to try minimalizing a bit. 90% of my mess is usually clothes strewn about.

I'm trying not to push them too hard because they're still pretty young, but I want to be able to maintain my household.

I'm in the second half of my life so I have more experience seeing this pattern play out than I did in my driven young adulthood. I forgive anyone who can't imagine not wanting ""The thing"". But the corner office, the sports car, the white whale collectible... You might change priorities and stop wanting them. No matter if you accomplish the goal or not. That shift in identity can be a loss. Grieving the loss of such an important mental construction is totally okay. 

I think minimalists don't sufficiently acknowledge how sorrowful it can feel to not want stuff... childhood toys, heirlooms or the big house anymore. I experience a lot of ""What was this all for?"" Feelings. 

Have you ever experienced ""Want Grief"" in this way? How did you process it?

Over time I‚Äôm slowly become more minimalistic,"I struggled with hoarding for a very long time then coped by having collections and I got really protective over my things after being homeless twice. Now I‚Äôm starting to appreciate having less more and more. I actually just donated a bunch of random items I don‚Äôt need or use or have too much of without a need to have that much of it. After my final move that‚Äôs coming soon I‚Äôm planning to just embrace the less is better mindset. Some items I genuinely need a lot of like cat litter bags (dog poop bags), sanitation wipes, etc. but everything else I really only need 1 set, a few of it just 1. I don‚Äôt need or want so much clutter. A lot of it really is just stuff. I have a box of sentimental items and some things I really don‚Äôt want to let go of like my second TV but I actually use those things daily so I can justify having them. But most of my stuff (which I donated) was just unused junk in good or decent condition. I didn‚Äôt need 73 bowls. Yes, I counted. And I definitely didn‚Äôt need 47 reusable straws!

When It's Not a Choice but a Necessity,"Minimalism sometimes isn't a lifestyle choice, but rather a necessity forced by circumstances.

Back home, my parents would fill our house with countless possessions. Perhaps it was because we had plenty of space, or maybe it was their generation's desire for material abundance. Now, living away from home, I rent a 35-square-meter apartment in the city center. While the space is small and expensive, it unexpectedly led me to discover a different way of living.

The spatial constraints forced me to learn organization, and more importantly, to control the influx of items from the source. In my kitchen, for example, I only have an air fryer and a cooking pot, which sufficiently meet my daily cooking needs.

The biggest change has been in my wardrobe. I used to think I needed lots of clothes for different combinations, but now I wonder: why do humans need so many clothes? It's not just about space - it's wasteful and environmentally harmful.

So I started buying quality basic pieces. I only get one of each style, but I invest more in pants and outerwear because quality matters for frequently worn items. Gradually, I fell in love with mix-and-match styling: today it's pants A with top A and jacket B, tomorrow it becomes pants A with top B. Friends think I have lots of clothes, but it's really just different combinations of a few pieces.

This minimalism, which started out of necessity, has given me a clearer understanding of ""wants"" versus ""needs."" It's like looking at a coffee shop's elaborate menu - when you know you just love iced Americano, all those fancy options become unnecessary.

Minimalism has taught me that less is more. It's not just environmentally friendly; it brings clarity to life. When we truly understand what we need, we can live a richer life with less.",minimalism,1741054825.0

I think if I just slept on the floor maybe it‚Äôll accumulate bodily oils or whatever. So I need something that prevents that. Like maybe some cloth on top that‚Äôs equivalent to a bunch of bedsheets all in one. 

The floor feels comfortable enough. But if that is too soft and bad for posture, then id look into sleeping on a wooden board, whatever works.

Rant: kids toys etc.,"Hello, so this is very much a rant but I need talk about this just to get it (mostly frustration) out of my head. 

I'm visiting my brother in another country and he has 2 young kids (under 7 years). Now, I'm childfree but I know kids stuff can get to a lot, especially when parents are financially okay. Now, all this is just part of a cultural shock for me, given I don't spend time around kids in my regular life + I'm quite minimalist otherwise as well. I'm sure a lot/all of this is probably already been discussed in the community but I just need to rant and I don't have any other place to do so. If it breaks any community rules, I'll delete the post. 

RANT: 

1. Quantity and choices-  Just the amount and types of coloring things, for example. I grew up in a different time and in a different socio-economic place, but I can remember having a set of sketchpens and a couple of sets of crayons/paints and being so excited about them. The degree of choices available to kids these days is overwhelming to me. 


2. Return gifts- I've been here a little over a week and one of the kids has been to a couple of birthday parties during this time. The return gifts they get from parties - omg. So many tiny cheap plastic things. I know a lot of this is a product of time and place, and parents (like everyone else) ofcourse repeat what they largely see around them, but just from 2 parties the kids got so many little things. They get excited about it for 2 hours and then they're ofcourse forgotten. They've collected so many of the same types of things because of just the return gifts they've gotten over the years. 


This is all I've noticed in the week I've been here and it's been overwhelming to say the least. I don't know how/whether it affects the kids psycholocally and I don't know if there are positive elements to it, but it isn't surprising to me that adults end up becoming so consumerist by default. Even grocery stores like Walmart/Costco are same, targetted towards adults. I can now understand that it can take a lot of self control for most people to not spend frivolously here (provided they have money to be frivolous about). I'm very conscious about buying normally but here, even I've had to really impulse control myself in grocery stores. ",minimalism,1741116639.0

I want to also sell it but I keep convincing myself I might use it for learning more about electronics, but I no longer have the mental function (burnout from retail work/caffeine/nicotine addiction) to use it. I also have an Atari 2600 which isn't so big and heavy and everything fits in a shoe box.

A Long-term Approach to Choosing Electronics,"These days we're overwhelmed with electronic products, with new models coming out every year that tempt us to impulse buy. In the past, fewer choices made decisions easier. Now, with so many options available, it takes careful thought to choose what truly suits us.

I used Android phones before switching to iPhone last year. While expensive at first, I've found the ecosystem really convenient, especially how devices work together seamlessly. It feels worth it.

For apps, I prefer simple designs with solid functionality. Once I find something that works, I stick with it rather than constantly switching. This lets me focus more on what I actually want to do.

Sometimes I think it's better to buy something more expensive but genuinely useful, rather than lots of cheaper things that don't work as well.",minimalism,1741245442.0

New to minimalism. Something I just learned at 26 years old,"I saw someone mention ""maximalist"" a long time ago, and I just assumed what it was. Didn't think much of it. I randomly thought of it today and decided to get an answer per Google. So apparently, maximalism brings together colors, patterns, designs, etc. And yes it also involves a lot of stuff. 

So relating to society, I grew up around people who color and style matched everything. It was heavily normalized from the people around me, businesses, and entertainment. So basically today I just found out that color scheming and buying stuff for the house that matches is considered maximalism. Bathroom sets, bedroom sets, livingroom sets, and many more. Seems sort of ""duh"" but I have a lot of conditioning to unlearn.

I think that minimalism should be the default way of living, and not based on marketing or societal views. It's really weird to realize that all the thoughts I've had about ""that won't match so I can't buy that"" or nearly buying entire sets because I wanted my home to be a filled with aeathetic stuff, was just maximalism the entire time.

Any thoughts? ",minimalism,1741280789.0

How I approach minimalism in my life.,"I've noticed that a lot of folks in this wonderful community have a somewhat different view on what minimalism is about. With that in mind, I want to chip in with my own perspective on this subject. I'll keep it minimal. :)

Most posts on here tend to relate to buying/not buying or getting rid of physical stuff, but, to me, minimalism starts with your mindset. It's a certain culture of thinking. It's about managing your expectations and being content with you have -- not just in terms of physical items but also life in general, with all its happenings.

I find decluttering and keeping my mind neatly ordered is much more important than applying the same to my wardrobe or desk, which is merely a byproduct of my minimalism, and not its main feature.

To illustrate my point: when I come across, say, a piece of news, I try to ingest it neutrally without judgement -- as if I'm an independent observer looking in from the outside and just taking note of things. I'm not into any particular paradigm (as far as politics, religion, philosophy, or anything else, really), which tremendously helps in keeping negative thoughts out or quickly filtering them out. No, I'm not a robot, but I've conditioned my mind well enough to be emotionally unaffected by events that I don't have control over.

P.S. Regarding the ownership of physical goods -- yes, I enjoy having as few of those as I practically need, too. It just gives me a nice overall sense of order, complements my mental approach. :)",minimalism,1741361898.0

"Wish me luck as I'm at my final week of a fridge/freezer/pantry purge, and will finally grocery-shop for the first time in 2025 next week","I made my last grocery run on December 31. Since then I've been slowing getting through my fridge, freezer, and pantry foods. I think I have about a week's worth of food left, down to a few cans of beans, cans of tomatoes, some sardines, pre-assembled frozen fruits for smoothies, meal replacements, and pasta. 2 and a half months without grocery shopping might seem like a long time but the process has been prolonged by business trips and complementary meals at my work gigs.

I admit, **the temptation to go grocery shopping before next weekend is strong**, but I think I want to wait out of principle, and because I've managed to last this long anyway.

The feeling of starting fresh with an empty fridge and freezer next week is pretty exciting. I also hope to start a routine of only having 3 days worth of perishables and only 7 days worth of frozen & canned foods moving forward.

I Miss Nothing,"Hey everyone, just wanted to give my quick experience with downsizing over the past 2 years... 

I understand lots of this won't apply to most of you, but the principle hopefully will. I'm 22M, and I still live at home (I'm very grateful to still live with my mom, while I'm finishing my transition into law enforcement full-time). My girlfriend and I are planning to move into our own place by the end of the year, while she continues paramedic school.

I grew up with very little money, thankfully my mother really persevered, and we're doing better now. However, I grew a notorious habit of hoarding, and collecting garbage. ANYTHING that I thought I might need one day, I kept. I would bring things home I found on the side of the road, I would collect literal garbage (empty energy drink cans, old computer parts, etc)...

Over the past few years, I've really been pushing to build a good career and future for myself, and hopefully for my girlfriend as well. But pushing myself to get rid of my ""collecting"" was hard. 

I've finally made the last push recently to get rid of almost everything left that I own that isn't ""functional"" in some way. And I can safely say, I miss NOTHING! There's not a single thing I've donated, or thrown away that I regret. Sentimental items, items I ""may need"" one day, etc. I kept one collection, which still allows me to feed that urge to ""bring something home"" (Pop Vinyls, for those wondering. The one thing I allow myself to bring in that isn't functional in any real way)...

I may not have had a whole house of stuff to go through, but I had a lot. Probably enough to fill a basement apartment with random items...

Since following a minimal-ish lifestyle, I feel way less anxious. I enjoy a clean space, and feel like I have a huge weight off my shoulders. I cam move everything I own into a UHaul within probably 2 hours when I'm ready. I feel like I have a great place to start when I move out, and I feel like I truly conquered most of my ""hoarding"" tendencies... And the biggest thing I learned is: 

You Won't Miss That Item!

Things I held onto for years, I threw away, and never thought of again. I never did ""need"" the majority of the things I saved. And if I DO need something, I buy 1 as needed... I now feel confident getting rid of items, and I have never actually had a feeling of regret after getting rid of something.

handmade life,"Is there a niche of people who, like me, have the desire to ditch products made of man-made materials such as plastic and on top of that most factory-made products in general?

I have this huge desire to only be surrounded by thoughtfully handmade, and well-made things. And only that what we really need.... basically like it was before industrialisation.  
  
Now I'm not gonna ditch my washing machine, fridge or oven at this stage as I have 3 children lol, but in a realistic sense I just have this feeling deep inside me that I want to be more connected with the things I own and know where they come from. And also I enjoy doing this slower and intentional, like using a handmade broom instead of a vacuum, or kneading my bread by hand instead of a kitchen machine... and so on....I really despise electricity powered machines and avoid them where reasonably possible.

Starting Fresh in Portugal ‚Äì Advice from Minimalist Immigrants,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm moving to Portugal in June and starting over with just my clothing, a box of sentimental items, some cook books, and my bike.  My daughter's (11) packing priorities are much different than mine - she has her stuffed animals, legos, and boardgames as her must haves. 

Our new apartment is already furnished with a dining table, sofa, and beds, but I‚Äôll need to prioritize what to buy next to create a functional minimalist lifestyle for us. 

As I (48/M) purge my current home, I‚Äôve realized just how much stuff I own served no real purpose. It took me several trips to the local donation center just to make a sizable dent in everything I had accumulated over the years. This process has made me even more intentional about what I bring into my new home.

For those of you who‚Äôve made a similar move, if you had to start over again with only the essentials, what would be at the top of your must-buy list? Are there any purchases you regret or wish you had prioritized differently?

A few things I know I‚Äôll need as I settle in:

- Basic kitchen essentials

- Bedding and towels

- Storage/organization solutions

- Lighting 

- Small appliances like an electric kettle and microwave. 

I‚Äôm planning to live car-free, so I‚Äôd also love recommendations for practical ways to transport groceries, run errands, and navigate daily life by bike or public transit.

Any advice, lessons learned, or must-have items would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!",minimalism,1741663997.0

My Medication Cabinet Declutter: A Reminder for Everyone,"Today I tackled a task I'd been putting off: decluttering my medication cabinet. And wow, I'm so glad I did! I was honestly shocked at what I found.

 * Expired Meds: A whole bunch of them. Some were years past their ""best by"" date.
 * Unused Prescriptions: Medications I'd been prescribed for past ailments, long gone and forgotten.
 * Random Samples: Leftover samples from doctor visits that were just taking up space.

It was a real eye-opener. Not only was it cluttered and disorganized, but it was also potentially unsafe. Having expired or unnecessary medications lying around is a recipe for confusion and potential mistakes.

This experience really drove home the minimalist principle of regularly evaluating what we own. Just because something is ""medicine"" doesn't mean it's exempt from being decluttered.

I'm now left with only the medications I actually need, neatly organized and easy to access. It feels so much better!

forcing myself to put down work and put myself onto the sofa,"i know this might be a weird headline. and indirectly minimalism.. or more so: lack of when you re constantly doing something productive so your head wont get a chance to rest. some mental minimalism sort of. 

something i am trying to do the last couple days is to set myself a time of the say, for example 20:00 in the evening and after that i am basically not allowed to do any more productive stuff.

not that i am the most productive person ever but at the moment i just feel like it might just be better to spend your evening hours doing some fun or relaxing things. and it doesnt even matter too much what exactly it is, productive work, cleaning the kitchen, researching, learning, creative work...

as soon as it get dark outside and its evening hours and the clock hits 20:00, im kind of forcing myself to stop whatever it is i am doing, and just continue with it tomorrow and have like 3-4 hours of relaxing me or fun time. 

what are your thoughts?

i was just thinking back a little the other day, how chill my grandma for example always was and i dont think i saw her doing anything ''productive'' in the evening ever. it might be some oldschool mentality but for her , the day was long enough for productive stuff already, so evening shouldnt be like that. evening was always reserved for chilling with the family, some tv, eating dinner, stuff like that.

My mom hates when I get rid of things,"Like the title says, my (F 24) mom dislikes when I get rid of things. Whether it be clothes I don‚Äôt wear, books I‚Äôve already read and probably won‚Äôt read again, old artwork I‚Äôve made that I‚Äôm not super proud of, etc, she will still act disappointed that I don‚Äôt want to keep these things. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm throwing them away. I always donate my unused clothes to Goodwill or sell on Poshmark and I‚Äôm trying to sell some books on Thriftbooks. I feel like I‚Äôm not actually wasting my items I‚Äôve bought before because I‚Äôve gotten my use out of them and am trying to donate or sell them, but now I want to reclaim my space for other things (not always for future things I‚Äôm going to buy, but maybe just so the whole room looks more put together). I have always been a more minimal person and dislike clutter. I feel like she doesn‚Äôt understand that when I have a clear space, I can focus better on other things and not worry about all the stuff in front of me. The only thing I allow myself to really ‚Äúcollect‚Äù is clothes and shoes (to a reasonable point). 

I just wish she‚Äôd realize that none of this stuff I want to get rid of involves her. Yes I still live with her and my dad, but there‚Äôs some things I don‚Äôt understand. For example, if I want to sell a book I‚Äôve already read, she‚Äôll say ‚Äúbut those are sentimental‚Äù when half the time she doesn‚Äôt even know which books I have since they‚Äôre stored in my room away from everyone, and she never asks what I‚Äôm reading anyways, so how would she know what is sentimental to me or not? Wouldn‚Äôt it be better for that book to be loved by someone who hasn‚Äôt read it before and can benefit from its cheaper price on Thriftbooks? I do intend to keep my childhood books like picture books forever, as those are the ones that are sentimental to me and what I remember my parents reading to me when growing up. 

I will admit, I do have a shopping problem, but I am working on it and want to become more minimal. Clothes is a hard one for me since I work in a clothing store and need to look the part, plus clothes are a passion of mine. I have started a budget for clothes that I am not allowed to go over for every month. I also try to think more about clothing purchases before buying, sometimes taking weeks before I commit to actually buying. Books are getting better because I received a Kindle as a gift and that eliminates physical clutter (plus I try to read the books I‚Äôve bought on there before I allow myself to buy other Kindle books). I‚Äôm not really a person to buy much else unless I‚Äôm looking to buy a certain perfume or cute small trinkets like Littlest Pets which are nostalgic to me (only have 4 of these though, so not a huge clutter problem). 

How should I react when my mom doesn‚Äôt want me to get rid of things? Should I do it anyways? My view of life is that if I really need it, I can buy it again and also I can‚Äôt take it with me when I‚Äôm dead and gone, so if I don‚Äôt love it during my life why am I keeping it? I‚Äôm constantly thinking about how much nicer my room would look if that one specific bookshelf was cleaned off a bit, how more refined my closet would be with that donation bag gone, etc. Any tips appreciated!

i.e. our examples: 

* we only buy second-hand clothes (except underwear) and sell our own‚Äîusually vintage items of better quality that last longer. 
* Whenever possible, we only buy what we can actually consume. 
* We also try to purchase discounted groceries close to their expiration dates and reduced-price fresh produce (ideally locally grown). 
* We freeze any excess food to avoid waste and avoid buying ultra-processed foods altogether.
* We don't own an expensive car and try to use public transportation as much as possible. 
* For furniture, we only buy or obtain pre-owned items. 
* We also practice the ‚Äúbuy one, throw out two‚Äù rule. 
* Another simple rule I personally follow is to ""sleep on it""‚Äîif I still feel like I need something the next day, then I consider buying it. 
* When dining out, we typically order the cheapest or second-cheapest wine, if any at all.

Food/Eating Out,"Some thoughts on eating out.

When I moved into a city, I finally had the opportunity to eat out and test out a lot of different restaurants. I would order online from a variety of places and I was excited to test out new dishes and restaurants. Now, after probably hundreds of orders over the years, I've come to the realisation that the majority of restaurants out there just are not worth it. 

The majority of the dishes are either too expensive for what you're really getting, or they're really salty, greasy or lack flavour. This isn't ONLY dependent on the quality of the restaurant itself, because I've tested out so many of them and more often than not, I feel disappointed afterwards. Most of the restaurants have had many good/great reviews. Maybe it's a me-issue, or not.

I feel like this realisation ''forces'' me to embody minimalism regarding eating out because I'm just so annoyed that the restaurants are mid or below mid. Homemade food is sooo much better. Why would I order some average dish while at the same price I can buy some type of steak and potatoes to be prepared at home? Now if I see a new restaurant, I can usually already tell what their food is gonna be like based on the photos and vibe and my previous compulsion to test out places is diminishing.

I come from a family of hoarders, my mom was diagnosed with OCD shortly after my father my left her & it's been awful. My Grand mother and father were hoarders too, to a point you couldn't walk around in the house.  
My mother held onto every piece of my grandmother after she passed & piled on it more. The house looks likes a dump yard. I have tried to give my mom an intervention of decluterring but honestly it hasn't gone down well.  
I am so so bothered by it, like when I visit my mom I feel like beetles are crawling up my skin, and my ears run hot.

I used to be an ‚Äúextreme‚Äùminimalist,"I used to be a hardcore extreme minimalist.

Everything I owned could fit into one bag. I just couldn‚Äôt bear owning *anything* that wasn‚Äôt the most lightest, smallest, thinnest, compact version of whatever it is I needed. It *had* to be the *most* minimalist.

My logic was, if the alien mothership landed and it was time to aboard, I‚Äôd be ready with my one bag whilst everyone else would be fumbling over their clutter. 

‚ÄúF-you, I‚Äôm prepared and you‚Äôre all not‚Äù

However, extreme minimalism was actually ruining me, my mindset and my relationship. It was *too* stressful. 

The paradox was I was attached to *being* detached. Obsessed with it. 

Nobody could buy me anything without me instantly giving it away or binning it. Owning even a single unnecessary item felt like mental torture. Weighing me down. It got so bad.

I was carrying the mindset of extreme minimalism like a burden.

After a lot of mental work I freed myself from the *extreme* minimalist burden. I‚Äôm still technically minimalist (*aiming* to not have anything unnecessarily burdening me) but I‚Äôm *far more* chilled these days. 

I‚Äôve got a couch I don‚Äôt use, table and chairs I never sit at, even a huge TV in my cinema room I never watch. This was *unfathomable* to me before with my old mindset. 

Now though, having stuff doesn‚Äôt bother me anywhere near as much anymore. 

My mindset now is detached, even from the idea of minimalism itself. If I want something I‚Äôll buy it. If I want to keep it, I keep it. If I want to ditch it, I ditch it. There‚Äôs zero emotional attachment, even to the idea of minimalism itself. 

So the irony is, I‚Äôm more detached now than when I was obsessively minimalist. 

Even though I own much more stuff these days, I could still walk out today with just my phone and a small bag and be fine. I don‚Äôt want to be *owned by the idea* of owning practically nothing if that makes sense. 

Balance is key.

Giving up items connected to passions you‚Äôve lost.,"I‚Äôve been a clarinet player most of my life. I was pretty good, but performing and teaching were never my calling. Eventually I perused a repair career and was a woodwind tech for ~6 years. 

I loved my job. However things in the industry took a turn for the worst after COVID. I have a full post elsewhere describing the details, but the short version is I poured my heart and soul into my work only to be fired for things outside of my control. 

I was devastated. So devastated that I‚Äôm in a different line of work entirely and haven‚Äôt played since the day I was fired (over a year ago). Something just‚Ä¶broke I guess? I‚Äôm no longer interested in being a clarinet player and I know objectively my instrument isn‚Äôt in good condition.

Uniformed Wardrobe simplifies my Life,"Being a 61 year old widower and still working full time motivates me to be sure life is simple and effective to minimize any burdens.  Working in retail most of my life has never burdened me with spending the money and worry of clothing for work.  Being organized and having uniformed work clothes carried that to my outside of work  habits with wardrobe.  I have my work clothes then I have 3-4 pair of comfortable khaki's and repeat a charcoal colored or grey t-shirt or sweat shirt.  The fact there is no energy in thought of ""what to wear"" gains so much toward the important things to do for that day.  Cost wise and laundry management has cut so much in time and money.  The idea was presented to me years ago in the 90's when I was a REALTOR and knew this bank branch manager.  I seen her frequently since she managed the bank I used and business dealings.  One time she had placed her home on the market.  I had the opportunity to show it to a client.  I was shocked when showing her walk-in closet that she had only used less than a 1/4th of the space for her wardrobe and her husband about the same on the opposite wall.  She had maybe 4-5 Khaki slacks and about a half a dozen of long-sleeved button down light blue oxford shirts with the bank logo on them.  she had one pair of black slacks and one pair of jeans with 2 white blouses and no more than 2-3 t-shirts neatly folded on the top shelf.  I asked her if they had already moved with so less clothes in their closet, she laughed and explained the uniformed wardrobe technique to me.  Her and her husband with this type of actions toward material things were able to retire and travel in their RV in their late 50's.   ",minimalism,1742739431.0

My first post here. I have recently moved in with my gf and personally I have always been a minimalist, and she likes the idea of minimalism too, but in practice I noticed how she has a fear of throwing things that look nice (like a candle jar or other small objects that are not longer serving their original purpose) away. We don't live in a big apartment, so over time things collect so much that it's just hard to exist with so many objects that you don't even use.

iPhone 14, Dell Inspiron 14 (it was gifted to me), iPad Air 5th Gen w/ Apple Pencil and folio keyboard case (used mostly as a glorified cookbook and occasional notebook), Kobo Libra 2

Except that I never had time to actually execute those projects, so the boxes of crafting stuff that was actually trash just kept piling up. But aside from the crafting, I was also generally quite anxious about what if I one day needed something but didn't have the money to buy it? I envisioned an ideal life where if I ever needed something, I'd already have it somewhere. I thought that would give me the ultimate feeling of security and control over my own life.

Somehow, at some point I shifted towards feeling anxious about *owning things* rather than *not owning things. I* completely turned around to minimalism, over the course of multiple decluttering sesssions but also by gradually throwing out more items over time in between.

Minimalism didn‚Äôt just declutter my home; it uncluttered my mind and reignited my passion for writing,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôve been a part of this community for a while now, and I wanted to share how minimalism has changed my life in unexpected ways.

Few years ago, my apartment was a mess‚Äîcluttered with things I didn‚Äôt need or even like. I was stressed, anxious, and felt like I was just going through the motions. Then, during the lockdown, I started reading more on this sub and decided to give minimalism a better shot.

I started by decluttering one room at a time. It was hard at first, letting go of things I thought I might need ‚Äúsomeday.‚Äù But as I saw my space opening up, I felt a weight lifting off my shoulders.

The turning point came when I cleared out my spare room, which had become a dumping ground for junk. Underneath the piles, I found my old notebook and a box of pens that I hadn‚Äôt used in years. I used to *love* writing‚Äîstories, poems, anything‚Äîbut life got busy, and I told myself I didn‚Äôt have time for it. But with my space and mind decluttered, I suddenly had the mental space to start typing again.

Now, writing is my daily escape. It‚Äôs not just a hobby; it‚Äôs a way to express myself and find peace. I‚Äôve even started sharing my work on a blog I named [minimalifestyle](https://minimalifestyle.com/), and the feedback has been amazing. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve rediscovered a part of myself I thought was lost. 

Minimalism didn‚Äôt just give me a tidy home; it gave me back my passion and a new sense of direction. I realized that all the stuff I was holding onto was holding me back from what truly matters.

If I noticed my kids didn't play with something, I would just put it in the box and if they didn't ask for it, I would donate. Now my oldest has started to notice. He asks about toys he hasn't seen in awhile. I explained I donated them and he was very upset. I have tried to get him to pick out his own toys to donate but he doesn't understand and just says he likes them all and ""please don't give them away."" Easter is coming up and in the past I have let the grandmas do whatever. This means my kids get 3 Easter baskets in one day. One from me with things they actually need in it (usually a swimsuit, summer shoes, and maybe a toy they have been wanting but it's either high quality or thrifted.) This year I asked my mom and MIL not to do an Easter basket because it is so excessive for them to get 3 and my mom was very upset and said I just keep adding more ""rules."" We ended up getting in a big fight and both admitted Christmas was ruined for both of us. For me because the kids got so much stuff and I felt completely overwhelmed by it. For my mom it was because she felt like she ""toned it down"" and I still wasn't happy and some of the gifts were duplicates so we left them at my parents house for the kids to use there.

Edit: Thanks for all the advice everyone. Just wanted to add that my kids are 4 and 1 so this isn‚Äôt like a teenager who is watching me throw away their stuff. I have only donated baby toys and things that are not really age appropriate anymore. The minute he said he was upset about it I stopped donating. ",minimalism,1743101248.0
"‚ÄúExtreme‚Äù (Ultra) minimalism, Dark side of minimalism, Ethical Maximalism.","I really love ‚ÄúExtreme‚Äù minimalism I believe exploravore from YouTube calls it ultra minimalism, But I think people get caught up in numbers. I personally think it‚Äôs about how having items that you know serve you or spark joy in some way. Clutter really overwhelms me. Where things start to seem off to me is where people take out all furniture and decor. Everyone has a right to have their home the way they desire however, it seems like capitalism takes the art, symbolism, and culturally meaning out of things sometimes in minimalism, sometimes by removing the items all together. Again your home is your home but if you have any disabled friends or family that visit you would it maybe be nice if they could sit to rest? 
People who have been known to be involved within minimalism often only include what‚Äôs needed to survive not thrive. Which seems very much a product of capitalism.

The Essence of Japanese Minimalism in Interior Decoration and Film,"Minimalism is often associated with contemporary design and modern aesthetics, yet its roots in Japan extend far beyond the 20th-century minimalist movement in the West. Japanese minimalism, particularly in interior decoration, is deeply intertwined with cultural philosophy, Zen Buddhism, and the aesthetics of simplicity and imperfection. This design philosophy has transcended architecture and interiors, becoming a key feature in some of Japan‚Äôs most celebrated films, subtly conveying themes of solitude, contemplation, and harmony.

# Origins and Philosophy of Japanese Minimalism

The foundation of Japanese minimalism lies in traditional Japanese architecture, which values simplicity, natural materials, and functional beauty. Influenced by Zen Buddhism and the concept of ""wabi-sabi""‚Äîthe appreciation of imperfection and transience‚ÄîJapanese minimalism emerged as an aesthetic that eschews excess and embraces the essential.

Traditional Japanese homes, known as ""minka,"" embody this principle with their tatami-matted floors, sliding paper doors (shoji), and built-in storage that maximizes open space. The use of natural materials like wood, paper, and stone, along with neutral colors, contributes to a serene atmosphere, encouraging mindfulness and a connection with nature. Unlike Western interiors, which often emphasize permanence and decoration,

Japanese spaces are designed to be fluid, adaptable, and in tune with seasonal changes.

During the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868), the tea ceremony, orchestrated by Sen no Riky≈´, further influenced minimalist interiors. The tea room, or ""chashitsu,"" was designed to be a simple yet profound space, where every element served a purpose. This aesthetic later inspired modern Japanese architects such as Tadao Ando and Kengo Kuma, whose works emphasize clean lines, natural light, and spatial balance.

# Minimalism in Japanese Cinema

The principles of Japanese minimalism have also been vividly captured in cinema, where spatial emptiness, subdued color palettes, and careful composition mirror the aesthetics of traditional interiors. Filmmakers such as Yasujir≈ç Ozu, Akira Kurosawa, and Hirokazu Kore-eda have utilized minimalist settings to evoke emotion and contemplation.

Yasujir≈ç Ozu, particularly in films like¬†*Tokyo Story*¬†(1953), exemplifies the integration of minimalism in visual storytelling. His signature ""tatami shot,"" where the camera is placed at a low angle to mimic the perspective of someone seated on the floor, highlights the simplicity of traditional interiors. The restrained movement of characters within uncluttered rooms reinforces themes of transience and familial disconnection.

Similarly, Akira Kurosawa‚Äôs¬†*Ikiru*¬†(1952) employs minimalistic settings to underscore the protagonist‚Äôs existential crisis. The sparse and often dimly lit rooms contrast with the emotional weight carried by the characters, allowing the space itself to speak volumes about isolation and mortality.

More recently, Hirokazu Kore-eda‚Äôs films, such as¬†*Still Walking*¬†(2008) and¬†*Our Little Sister*¬†(2015), depict contemporary Japanese homes that still adhere to minimalist traditions. These films emphasize the harmony between living spaces and personal reflection, subtly highlighting the importance of space in shaping human relationships.

# The Modern Relevance of Japanese Minimalism

In today‚Äôs world, where clutter and consumerism dominate, Japanese minimalism has found a global audience seeking tranquility and order. The movement has influenced modern interior design trends, from the rise of ""Marie Kondo's KonMari method"" to the popularity of Scandinavian-Japanese hybrid aesthetics (""Japandi""). The core idea remains unchanged: to strip away the unnecessary and embrace the essence of a space.

Japanese minimalism, both in interiors and film, is not merely about aesthetic choices but a way of living‚Äîone that values harmony, mindfulness, and a deep connection to one's surroundings. Its enduring appeal lies in its ability to create an environment that fosters peace, reflection, and an appreciation for life's simple beauty.

Whether within the walls of a traditional Japanese home or the frames of a poignant film, minimalism serves as a reminder that space, silence, and simplicity can be as powerful as any grand design or elaborate narrative.",minimalism,1743298837.0
How to live like it‚Äôs the 90s?,"I‚Äôm a 31 female with no kids. I have a boyfriend, also 31, and we both live with his parents. 

because we work so much, we spend our wweekends just chilling at home, usually in front of the TV or with our laptops. We clock off on a Friday, I don‚Äôt get home until 7pm then Saturday and Sunday we rest and recharge ourselves for the week ahead. 

  
I keep talking about how much I loved growing up in the 90s & 00s. I would be so much more creative and energetic. I had a good social life growing up, we had days out as a family. We went to the cinema and swimming every weekend.  Now I‚Äôm too exhausted. I work 40 hours a week plus travel time. 

  
I want to be more present and in the moment and making memories together rather than plonking myself in front of my laptop. 

  
 I have come up with a few things such as deleting social media, and any apps on my iPhone. I will just use my phone for texts calls and podcasts. 

  
I will take a book with me everywhere rather than relying on my phone for entertainment. I have bought a bike and hoping my partner is going to invest in one too!

I want to align my lifestyle with my values,"I'm 23m and have become increasingly disenfranchised with society recently. I am seeing that we are losing connection with those around us and becoming lost and addicted to technology and we are destroying the Earth. It makes me so sad. üò¢ Some days I want to throw my smartphone in the trash. I would get rid of it if I didn't just get it. I swear my next phone will be something much simpler without all of the apps and things I don't need, just something I can talk and text, take pictures, and maybe listen to music. I have deleted all nonessential apps off my phone and have gotten my usage down to around 2hrs a day. I deleted all of my social media accounts except Reddit. It feels freeing. I am able to have a conversation and engage with people instead of just jumping to play on my phone. 

Since I was little I have been extremely passionate about the environment. This passion and concern has been fostered in multiple ways thanks to my parents who would take my family on trips to National Parks and forest, my time in the Scouts, my Catholic faith, and the area where I grew up. I grew up in a special place in NJ called the Pinelands. It is an extremely beautiful and ecologically diverse place where I first found my love of nature and the outdoors.

 In high school I decided to put my passion into action getting involved in the youth climate movement. I learned so much about what we could do to help the environment and helped organize multiple climate protests. During this time I made the decision to become vegan, and change other habits. This passion led me to pursue a degree in environmental studies with the goal of working in environmental policy where I believe I can have the most impact and help people. I am currently pursuing my master's degree in Public Administration.

 Our society is built on the idea of consuming and having abundance which is extremely wrong, but I am called not to judge instead I need to look at myself and what I can do. I have been examining my life and lifestyle and know I am not doing enough. I want to start living a simple life with minimal possessions. I have started eating more simply and being mindful of the things I do. I have so much stuff that has little value in my life and I haven't used or worn in so long. I know I should give it away, sell it or donate it. Yet it is hard to do. I also want to move to a place with easily accessible public transit so I don't need a car. I have been thinking about this for a long time and feel this is what I am called to do. 

It is hard for other people to comprehend and often causes fighting with my mother when she wants to buy me a new piece of clothing or get me gifts for holidays. She doesn't understand, but I try to remind her that I don't want any gifts and why I need something if I already have an item of clothing that is already suitable. Maybe I need to have a conversation with her explaining why I don't want stuff and how I am truly trying to live my life. I am grateful and understand that this is one way she shows her love. As a Catholic it is my moral obligation and imperative to be a good steward of the environment. This is the path I want to take. I know it is a lot, but I have been extremely blessed in my life and really want to do more with the gifts and resources I have in order to make a difference. ",minimalism,1743432894.0
