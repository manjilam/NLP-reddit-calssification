Dishes & food storage,"Y'all have any ideas regarding dishes and food storage? Part of me wonders about using glass food storage dishes as regular bowls, but I dislike that they mostly have plastic lids that may break on me. One thought crossed my mind of using glass bakeware (rectangular cassarole dish, square cake dish)? However those don't have proper lids for storage/travel usage. I've been reusing glass jars from the store, but they don't seal enough for liquids (unless kept upright) and aren't really good for eating out of either (iffy on drinking out of, the mouth can be wide, but too narrow and it's hard to clean)",minimalism,1743453842.0

Minimalist wardrobe for men?,"I am in college and looking to start upgrading from my high school clothing. I have always been a fan of quality over quantity. So naturally a minimalist wardrobe sounds perfect to me. I like the idea of having a few things with a lot of different combinations. Since I‚Äôm in college I plan to start with more casual clothing and then  move into formal as I grow up. Obviously with quality you will pay for it so I plan to build my wardrobe over the next couple years. I do have a few questions. 
-What should I start with? 
-Are there any recommendations of good brands for high quality goods (mainly casual for now: t shirts, shorts, pants, sweatshirts, etc)?
-What amount of each clothing is the sweet spot where you don‚Äôt have to many but have enough your not wearing the same outfit a bunch?

I want to align my lifestyle with my values,"I'm 23m and have become increasingly disenfranchised with society recently. I am seeing that we are losing connection with those around us and becoming lost and addicted to technology and we are destroying the Earth. It makes me so sad. üò¢ Some days I want to throw my smartphone in the trash. I would get rid of it if I didn't just get it. I swear my next phone will be something much simpler without all of the apps and things I don't need, just something I can talk and text, take pictures, and maybe listen to music. I have deleted all nonessential apps off my phone and have gotten my usage down to around 2hrs a day. I deleted all of my social media accounts except Reddit. It feels freeing. I am able to have a conversation and engage with people instead of just jumping to play on my phone. 

Since I was little I have been extremely passionate about the environment. This passion and concern has been fostered in multiple ways thanks to my parents who would take my family on trips to National Parks and forest, my time in the Scouts, my Catholic faith, and the area where I grew up. I grew up in a special place in NJ called the Pinelands. It is an extremely beautiful and ecologically diverse place where I first found my love of nature and the outdoors.

 In high school I decided to put my passion into action getting involved in the youth climate movement. I learned so much about what we could do to help the environment and helped organize multiple climate protests. During this time I made the decision to become vegan, and change other habits. This passion led me to pursue a degree in environmental studies with the goal of working in environmental policy where I believe I can have the most impact and help people. I am currently pursuing my master's degree in Public Administration.

 Our society is built on the idea of consuming and having abundance which is extremely wrong, but I am called not to judge instead I need to look at myself and what I can do. I have been examining my life and lifestyle and know I am not doing enough. I want to start living a simple life with minimal possessions. I have started eating more simply and being mindful of the things I do. I have so much stuff that has little value in my life and I haven't used or worn in so long. I know I should give it away, sell it or donate it. Yet it is hard to do. I also want to move to a place with easily accessible public transit so I don't need a car. I have been thinking about this for a long time and feel this is what I am called to do. 

It is hard for other people to comprehend and often causes fighting with my mother when she wants to buy me a new piece of clothing or get me gifts for holidays. She doesn't understand, but I try to remind her that I don't want any gifts and why I need something if I already have an item of clothing that is already suitable. Maybe I need to have a conversation with her explaining why I don't want stuff and how I am truly trying to live my life. I am grateful and understand that this is one way she shows her love. As a Catholic it is my moral obligation and imperative to be a good steward of the environment. This is the path I want to take. I know it is a lot, but I have been extremely blessed in my life and really want to do more with the gifts and resources I have in order to make a difference. ",minimalism,1743432894.0

 I have come up with a few things such as deleting social media, and any apps on my iPhone. I will just use my phone for texts calls and podcasts. 

  
I will take a book with me everywhere rather than relying on my phone for entertainment. I have bought a bike and hoping my partner is going to invest in one too!

The Essence of Japanese Minimalism in Interior Decoration and Film,"Minimalism is often associated with contemporary design and modern aesthetics, yet its roots in Japan extend far beyond the 20th-century minimalist movement in the West. Japanese minimalism, particularly in interior decoration, is deeply intertwined with cultural philosophy, Zen Buddhism, and the aesthetics of simplicity and imperfection. This design philosophy has transcended architecture and interiors, becoming a key feature in some of Japan‚Äôs most celebrated films, subtly conveying themes of solitude, contemplation, and harmony.

# Origins and Philosophy of Japanese Minimalism

The foundation of Japanese minimalism lies in traditional Japanese architecture, which values simplicity, natural materials, and functional beauty. Influenced by Zen Buddhism and the concept of ""wabi-sabi""‚Äîthe appreciation of imperfection and transience‚ÄîJapanese minimalism emerged as an aesthetic that eschews excess and embraces the essential.

Traditional Japanese homes, known as ""minka,"" embody this principle with their tatami-matted floors, sliding paper doors (shoji), and built-in storage that maximizes open space. The use of natural materials like wood, paper, and stone, along with neutral colors, contributes to a serene atmosphere, encouraging mindfulness and a connection with nature. Unlike Western interiors, which often emphasize permanence and decoration,

Japanese spaces are designed to be fluid, adaptable, and in tune with seasonal changes.

During the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868), the tea ceremony, orchestrated by Sen no Riky≈´, further influenced minimalist interiors. The tea room, or ""chashitsu,"" was designed to be a simple yet profound space, where every element served a purpose. This aesthetic later inspired modern Japanese architects such as Tadao Ando and Kengo Kuma, whose works emphasize clean lines, natural light, and spatial balance.

# Minimalism in Japanese Cinema

The principles of Japanese minimalism have also been vividly captured in cinema, where spatial emptiness, subdued color palettes, and careful composition mirror the aesthetics of traditional interiors. Filmmakers such as Yasujir≈ç Ozu, Akira Kurosawa, and Hirokazu Kore-eda have utilized minimalist settings to evoke emotion and contemplation.

Yasujir≈ç Ozu, particularly in films like¬†*Tokyo Story*¬†(1953), exemplifies the integration of minimalism in visual storytelling. His signature ""tatami shot,"" where the camera is placed at a low angle to mimic the perspective of someone seated on the floor, highlights the simplicity of traditional interiors. The restrained movement of characters within uncluttered rooms reinforces themes of transience and familial disconnection.

Similarly, Akira Kurosawa‚Äôs¬†*Ikiru*¬†(1952) employs minimalistic settings to underscore the protagonist‚Äôs existential crisis. The sparse and often dimly lit rooms contrast with the emotional weight carried by the characters, allowing the space itself to speak volumes about isolation and mortality.

More recently, Hirokazu Kore-eda‚Äôs films, such as¬†*Still Walking*¬†(2008) and¬†*Our Little Sister*¬†(2015), depict contemporary Japanese homes that still adhere to minimalist traditions. These films emphasize the harmony between living spaces and personal reflection, subtly highlighting the importance of space in shaping human relationships.

# The Modern Relevance of Japanese Minimalism

In today‚Äôs world, where clutter and consumerism dominate, Japanese minimalism has found a global audience seeking tranquility and order. The movement has influenced modern interior design trends, from the rise of ""Marie Kondo's KonMari method"" to the popularity of Scandinavian-Japanese hybrid aesthetics (""Japandi""). The core idea remains unchanged: to strip away the unnecessary and embrace the essence of a space.

Japanese minimalism, both in interiors and film, is not merely about aesthetic choices but a way of living‚Äîone that values harmony, mindfulness, and a deep connection to one's surroundings. Its enduring appeal lies in its ability to create an environment that fosters peace, reflection, and an appreciation for life's simple beauty.

Whether within the walls of a traditional Japanese home or the frames of a poignant film, minimalism serves as a reminder that space, silence, and simplicity can be as powerful as any grand design or elaborate narrative.",minimalism,1743298837.0

Again your home is your home but if you have any disabled friends or family that visit you would it maybe be nice if they could sit to rest?

How to deal with too many gifts now that my kid is old enough to notice when they disappear?,"We have a lot of family that lives very close and we see them all a lot. We also are the first to have kids so the grandparents are very involved. I have tried to set some boundaries around gifts but they just buy so much stuff for every holiday. I used to just smile, say thank you, and keep a box in the closet of donations. If I noticed my kids didn't play with something, I would just put it in the box and if they didn't ask for it, I would donate. Now my oldest has started to notice. He asks about toys he hasn't seen in awhile. I explained I donated them and he was very upset. I have tried to get him to pick out his own toys to donate but he doesn't understand and just says he likes them all and ""please don't give them away."" Easter is coming up and in the past I have let the grandmas do whatever. This means my kids get 3 Easter baskets in one day. One from me with things they actually need in it (usually a swimsuit, summer shoes, and maybe a toy they have been wanting but it's either high quality or thrifted.) This year I asked my mom and MIL not to do an Easter basket because it is so excessive for them to get 3 and my mom was very upset and said I just keep adding more ""rules."" We ended up getting in a big fight and both admitted Christmas was ruined for both of us. For me because the kids got so much stuff and I felt completely overwhelmed by it. For my mom it was because she felt like she ""toned it down"" and I still wasn't happy and some of the gifts were duplicates so we left them at my parents house for the kids to use there.

Edit: Thanks for all the advice everyone. Just wanted to add that my kids are 4 and 1 so this isn‚Äôt like a teenager who is watching me throw away their stuff. I have only donated baby toys and things that are not really age appropriate anymore. The minute he said he was upset about it I stopped donating. ",minimalism,1743101248.0
Minimalism didn‚Äôt just declutter my home; it uncluttered my mind and reignited my passion for writing,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôve been a part of this community for a while now, and I wanted to share how minimalism has changed my life in unexpected ways.

Few years ago, my apartment was a mess‚Äîcluttered with things I didn‚Äôt need or even like. I was stressed, anxious, and felt like I was just going through the motions. Then, during the lockdown, I started reading more on this sub and decided to give minimalism a better shot.

I started by decluttering one room at a time. It was hard at first, letting go of things I thought I might need ‚Äúsomeday.‚Äù But as I saw my space opening up, I felt a weight lifting off my shoulders.

The turning point came when I cleared out my spare room, which had become a dumping ground for junk. Underneath the piles, I found my old notebook and a box of pens that I hadn‚Äôt used in years. I used to *love* writing‚Äîstories, poems, anything‚Äîbut life got busy, and I told myself I didn‚Äôt have time for it. But with my space and mind decluttered, I suddenly had the mental space to start typing again.

Now, writing is my daily escape. It‚Äôs not just a hobby; it‚Äôs a way to express myself and find peace. I‚Äôve even started sharing my work on a blog I named [minimalifestyle](https://minimalifestyle.com/), and the feedback has been amazing.

"Anyone else here who used to have (almost) hoarding(-like) tendencies, but did a 180 to minimalism at some point?","Up until two years ago, I used to have mild hoarding tendencies. I had (and still have) a million and one crafty hobbies and I saw potential for *everything* to one day become part of some majestic crafty project. Except that I never had time to actually execute those projects, so the boxes of crafting stuff that was actually trash just kept piling up. But aside from the crafting, I was also generally quite anxious about what if I one day needed something but didn't have the money to buy it?

This shouldn't even be a problem but for some reason, I find it stressful when I own a lot of things, and I get this urge to declutter all over again. I think my impulse shopping really did start during the pandemonium back in 2020. I was bored, at home, really got into my creative hobbies and even started a small jewelry store online. Ive gotten so used to having packages come in that it turned into almost an impulse. Most likely, my stress when it comes to owning a lot came from my roots as a kid. My dad was part of the army growing up, and we moved around A LOT. I've gotten so used to owning so little that now that I've settled down, owning a lot makes me feel stressed. Should I still try to be a minimalist, or just stop putting that kind of pressure on myself? ",minimalism,1742847313.0

Too many tech gadgets and I feel overwhelmed,"I do enjoy tech, but in the last several months, I have begun to feel overwhelmed about all my tech‚Äîand guilty that I don‚Äôt use some of it to its full potential. 

I think my main issue is having too many gadgets that have some crossover in functionality, but I feel guilty selling them because some of them were impulsive or expensive (or both!). I think my biggest regret purchase was selling my older MacBook Pro for the iPad Air, thinking it could replace my MacBook. I find that when I want to read, I prefer my ereader and when I want media consumption or online shopping, I tend to grab my phone. When I want to do more than this, I‚Äôd rather use the PC laptop. The PC was gifted to me, but I‚Äôve had a tough time adjusting to PC, so I feel like it‚Äôs another overwhelming piece of tech. 

I also have a work Mac and iPad that I take home and work remotely with a few days a week, so I always feel like my desk is too full. 

My devices: 

iPhone 14, Dell Inspiron 14 (it was gifted to me), iPad Air 5th Gen w/ Apple Pencil and folio keyboard case (used mostly as a glorified cookbook and occasional notebook), Kobo Libra 2

I also have an Apple Watch, AirPods, Bose over the ear headphones, a switch, and a PS5. I don‚Äôt really have any issues with these, as they‚Äôre used often. 

Do other people feel overwhelmed by too many gadgets? Did you keep them, donate, or sell them? How have you overcome the guilty feeling of not utilizing something that you bought?

Living with someone who has a fear of getting rid of things,"Hi guys,

My first post here. I have recently moved in with my gf and personally I have always been a minimalist, and she likes the idea of minimalism too, but in practice I noticed how she has a fear of throwing things that look nice (like a candle jar or other small objects that are not longer serving their original purpose) away. We don't live in a big apartment, so over time things collect so much that it's just hard to exist with so many objects that you don't even use. She sometimes even forgets that she has kept something. She consciously understands the value of minimalism, but I think her fear of throwing things away or parting with them creates a confusion for her. So, my question is, has anyone ever encountered this and what would be a delicate way to approach this topic with someone to implement more minimalistic behaviours with them?",minimalism,1742813359.0

Digital Minimalism and Loneliness/Isolation,"Hi everyone,

I had to say goodbye to my friend group because they were always gossiping and being unnecessarily negative and I wanted to move on and find people who are more creative, positive, and kind...

Right now, I guess you could say that I am between friend groups and don't really have anyone like minded to talk to except maybe my mother (I am grateful for her).

I am using reddit to talk to like-minded folks and just to read comforting posts, but I really want to not use ANY social media...and I already quit Facebook and Insta, and never had Tik Tok, and only check Linked In when I need to for work!

I just cannot bring myself to get rid of reddit because I am lonely.

Uniformed Wardrobe simplifies my Life,"Being a 61 year old widower and still working full time motivates me to be sure life is simple and effective to minimize any burdens.  Working in retail most of my life has never burdened me with spending the money and worry of clothing for work.  Being organized and having uniformed work clothes carried that to my outside of work  habits with wardrobe.  I have my work clothes then I have 3-4 pair of comfortable khaki's and repeat a charcoal colored or grey t-shirt or sweat shirt.  The fact there is no energy in thought of ""what to wear"" gains so much toward the important things to do for that day.  Cost wise and laundry management has cut so much in time and money.  The idea was presented to me years ago in the 90's when I was a REALTOR and knew this bank branch manager.  I seen her frequently since she managed the bank I used and business dealings.  One time she had placed her home on the market.  I had the opportunity to show it to a client.  I was shocked when showing her walk-in closet that she had only used less than a 1/4th of the space for her wardrobe and her husband about the same on the opposite wall.  She had maybe 4-5 Khaki slacks and about a half a dozen of long-sleeved button down light blue oxford shirts with the bank logo on them.  she had one pair of black slacks and one pair of jeans with 2 white blouses and no more than 2-3 t-shirts neatly folded on the top shelf.  I asked her if they had already moved with so less clothes in their closet, she laughed and explained the uniformed wardrobe technique to me.  Her and her husband with this type of actions toward material things were able to retire and travel in their RV in their late 50's.   ",minimalism,1742739431.0

Insufficient wardrobe,"Hi everyone,

(Sorry if my English is not perfect...)(Warning : this is a superficial topic).

I have a clothing issue. I tend to be a minimalist in every aspects of my life and I practice decluttering. The problem is : I may have decluttered too much in my wardrobe (everything I didn't fully like or didn't wear, so it seemed legit at the time) and I now feel like I have nothing to wear. I'd like to have a tailored capsule wardrobe that I love and wear but I have this rule where I'm only allowed to shop in ecofriendly brands and it seems that everything is so expensive.

Giving up items connected to passions you‚Äôve lost.,"I‚Äôve been a clarinet player most of my life. I was pretty good, but performing and teaching were never my calling. Eventually I perused a repair career and was a woodwind tech for ~6 years. 

I loved my job. However things in the industry took a turn for the worst after COVID. I have a full post elsewhere describing the details, but the short version is I poured my heart and soul into my work only to be fired for things outside of my control. 

I was devastated. So devastated that I‚Äôm in a different line of work entirely and haven‚Äôt played since the day I was fired (over a year ago). Something just‚Ä¶broke I guess?

I used to be an ‚Äúextreme‚Äùminimalist,"I used to be a hardcore extreme minimalist.

Everything I owned could fit into one bag. I just couldn‚Äôt bear owning *anything* that wasn‚Äôt the most lightest, smallest, thinnest, compact version of whatever it is I needed. It *had* to be the *most* minimalist.

My logic was, if the alien mothership landed and it was time to aboard, I‚Äôd be ready with my one bag whilst everyone else would be fumbling over their clutter. 

‚ÄúF-you, I‚Äôm prepared and you‚Äôre all not‚Äù

However, extreme minimalism was actually ruining me, my mindset and my relationship. It was *too* stressful. 

The paradox was I was attached to *being* detached. Obsessed with it. 

Nobody could buy me anything without me instantly giving it away or binning it. Owning even a single unnecessary item felt like mental torture. Weighing me down. It got so bad.

I was carrying the mindset of extreme minimalism like a burden.

After a lot of mental work I freed myself from the *extreme* minimalist burden. I‚Äôm still technically minimalist (*aiming* to not have anything unnecessarily burdening me) but I‚Äôm *far more* chilled these days. 

I‚Äôve got a couch I don‚Äôt use, table and chairs I never sit at, even a huge TV in my cinema room I never watch. This was *unfathomable* to me before with my old mindset. 

Now though, having stuff doesn‚Äôt bother me anywhere near as much anymore. 

My mindset now is detached, even from the idea of minimalism itself. If I want something I‚Äôll buy it. If I want to keep it, I keep it. If I want to ditch it, I ditch it. There‚Äôs zero emotional attachment, even to the idea of minimalism itself. 

So the irony is, I‚Äôm more detached now than when I was obsessively minimalist. 

Even though I own much more stuff these days, I could still walk out today with just my phone and a small bag and be fine. I don‚Äôt want to be *owned by the idea* of owning practically nothing if that makes sense. 

Balance is key.

My mother held onto every piece of my grandmother after she passed & piled on it more. The house looks likes a dump yard. I have tried to give my mom an intervention of decluterring but honestly it hasn't gone down well.  
I am so so bothered by it, like when I visit my mom I feel like beetles are crawling up my skin, and my ears run hot.  
Because of this I haven't been able to move into a house which I get to build from ground  up. I have tried to break this generational curse since by moving out living with 6 black t-shirts, one bag pack, 1 pair of jeans & the only thing I have splurged on is a smart ring.

Food/Eating Out,"Some thoughts on eating out.

When I moved into a city, I finally had the opportunity to eat out and test out a lot of different restaurants. I would order online from a variety of places and I was excited to test out new dishes and restaurants. Now, after probably hundreds of orders over the years, I've come to the realisation that the majority of restaurants out there just are not worth it. 

The majority of the dishes are either too expensive for what you're really getting, or they're really salty, greasy or lack flavour. This isn't ONLY dependent on the quality of the restaurant itself, because I've tested out so many of them and more often than not, I feel disappointed afterwards. Most of the restaurants have had many good/great reviews. Maybe it's a me-issue, or not.

I feel like this realisation ''forces'' me to embody minimalism regarding eating out because I'm just so annoyed that the restaurants are mid or below mid. Homemade food is sooo much better. Why would I order some average dish while at the same price I can buy some type of steak and potatoes to be prepared at home? Now if I see a new restaurant, I can usually already tell what their food is gonna be like based on the photos and vibe and my previous compulsion to test out places is diminishing. 

If I was gonna eat out, maybe I'd try out some extremely high-end restaurant where you can taste exotic flavours made by true professionals. 

It's funny that when you're younger, you want EVERYTHING out there regarding food. New snacks, trendy treats, restaurant food, you name it. But the older I become, the more limited my desires become. It's a good thing though because the majority of the food sold nowadays is more so crap than actual nutrition anyway. ",minimalism,1742317591.0

i.e. our examples: 

* we only buy second-hand clothes (except underwear) and sell our own‚Äîusually vintage items of better quality that last longer. 
* Whenever possible, we only buy what we can actually consume. 
* We also try to purchase discounted groceries close to their expiration dates and reduced-price fresh produce (ideally locally grown). 
* We freeze any excess food to avoid waste and avoid buying ultra-processed foods altogether.
* We don't own an expensive car and try to use public transportation as much as possible. 
* For furniture, we only buy or obtain pre-owned items. 
* We also practice the ‚Äúbuy one, throw out two‚Äù rule. 
* Another simple rule I personally follow is to ""sleep on it""‚Äîif I still feel like I need something the next day, then I consider buying it. 
* When dining out, we typically order the cheapest or second-cheapest wine, if any at all.
* I try to buy multi purpose tools, whenever I can.",minimalism,1742239772.0

How do you handle living with others‚Äô clutter?,"I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm a minimalist, but I certainly have no aversion to getting rid of things and try to keep spaces free of clutter. My family (wife and two kids) are another matter. My son has special needs and so is like most preschoolers would be - toys everywhere. My teenage daughter is good about keeping it to her room, but I can‚Äôt go in there, it‚Äôs immediately overwhelming. My wife is probably the most frustrating - even though I work from home, she gets the office because I need her mess to be behind a closed door. But that seems to only cover the top floor; on both the main level and finished basement she‚Äôs got multiple clutter areas. And just close your eyes when traversing the garage.

So what are your tricks and tips for sharing a household with materialists?",minimalism,1742180467.0
My mom hates when I get rid of things,"Like the title says, my (F 24) mom dislikes when I get rid of things. Whether it be clothes I don‚Äôt wear, books I‚Äôve already read and probably won‚Äôt read again, old artwork I‚Äôve made that I‚Äôm not super proud of, etc, she will still act disappointed that I don‚Äôt want to keep these things. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm throwing them away. I always donate my unused clothes to Goodwill or sell on Poshmark and I‚Äôm trying to sell some books on Thriftbooks. I feel like I‚Äôm not actually wasting my items I‚Äôve bought before because I‚Äôve gotten my use out of them and am trying to donate or sell them, but now I want to reclaim my space for other things (not always for future things I‚Äôm going to buy, but maybe just so the whole room looks more put together). I have always been a more minimal person and dislike clutter. I feel like she doesn‚Äôt understand that when I have a clear space, I can focus better on other things and not worry about all the stuff in front of me. The only thing I allow myself to really ‚Äúcollect‚Äù is clothes and shoes (to a reasonable point). 

I just wish she‚Äôd realize that none of this stuff I want to get rid of involves her. Yes I still live with her and my dad, but there‚Äôs some things I don‚Äôt understand. For example, if I want to sell a book I‚Äôve already read, she‚Äôll say ‚Äúbut those are sentimental‚Äù when half the time she doesn‚Äôt even know which books I have since they‚Äôre stored in my room away from everyone, and she never asks what I‚Äôm reading anyways, so how would she know what is sentimental to me or not? Wouldn‚Äôt it be better for that book to be loved by someone who hasn‚Äôt read it before and can benefit from its cheaper price on Thriftbooks? I do intend to keep my childhood books like picture books forever, as those are the ones that are sentimental to me and what I remember my parents reading to me when growing up. 

I will admit, I do have a shopping problem, but I am working on it and want to become more minimal. Clothes is a hard one for me since I work in a clothing store and need to look the part, plus clothes are a passion of mine. I have started a budget for clothes that I am not allowed to go over for every month. I also try to think more about clothing purchases before buying, sometimes taking weeks before I commit to actually buying. Books are getting better because I received a Kindle as a gift and that eliminates physical clutter (plus I try to read the books I‚Äôve bought on there before I allow myself to buy other Kindle books). I‚Äôm not really a person to buy much else unless I‚Äôm looking to buy a certain perfume or cute small trinkets like Littlest Pets which are nostalgic to me (only have 4 of these though, so not a huge clutter problem). 

How should I react when my mom doesn‚Äôt want me to get rid of things? Should I do it anyways? My view of life is that if I really need it, I can buy it again and also I can‚Äôt take it with me when I‚Äôm dead and gone, so if I don‚Äôt love it during my life why am I keeping it? I‚Äôm constantly thinking about how much nicer my room would look if that one specific bookshelf was cleaned off a bit, how more refined my closet would be with that donation bag gone, etc. Any tips appreciated!

Minimalist husband wants things his way,"Hi,
My husband is a self-proclaimed minimalist. I myself follow minimalist ideals and I was even the one to turn my husband on to minimalism.
My view is that minimalism is different for everyone, and what might be ""enough stuff"" to one person might be different to another person. The important thing is that you take careful consideration for everything that you bring into your life. 
The problem here is that my husband not only gives me grief everytime I want to make a personal purchase, but he is also constantly asking me to donate things that i already own. Our house is already extremely paired down and we do not have excess, however he is often questioning why I have things and if I really need them.

something i am trying to do the last couple days is to set myself a time of the say, for example 20:00 in the evening and after that i am basically not allowed to do any more productive stuff.

not that i am the most productive person ever but at the moment i just feel like it might just be better to spend your evening hours doing some fun or relaxing things. and it doesnt even matter too much what exactly it is, productive work, cleaning the kitchen, researching, learning, creative work...

as soon as it get dark outside and its evening hours and the clock hits 20:00, im kind of forcing myself to stop whatever it is i am doing, and just continue with it tomorrow and have like 3-4 hours of relaxing me or fun time. 

what are your thoughts?

i was just thinking back a little the other day, how chill my grandma for example always was and i dont think i saw her doing anything ''productive'' in the evening ever. it might be some oldschool mentality but for her , the day was long enough for productive stuff already, so evening shouldnt be like that. evening was always reserved for chilling with the family, some tv, eating dinner, stuff like that.

My Medication Cabinet Declutter: A Reminder for Everyone,"Today I tackled a task I'd been putting off: decluttering my medication cabinet. And wow, I'm so glad I did! I was honestly shocked at what I found.

 * Expired Meds: A whole bunch of them. Some were years past their ""best by"" date.
 * Unused Prescriptions: Medications I'd been prescribed for past ailments, long gone and forgotten.
 * Random Samples: Leftover samples from doctor visits that were just taking up space.

It was a real eye-opener. Not only was it cluttered and disorganized, but it was also potentially unsafe. Having expired or unnecessary medications lying around is a recipe for confusion and potential mistakes.

This experience really drove home the minimalist principle of regularly evaluating what we own. Just because something is ""medicine"" doesn't mean it's exempt from being decluttered.

Starting Fresh in Portugal ‚Äì Advice from Minimalist Immigrants,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm moving to Portugal in June and starting over with just my clothing, a box of sentimental items, some cook books, and my bike.  My daughter's (11) packing priorities are much different than mine - she has her stuffed animals, legos, and boardgames as her must haves. 

Our new apartment is already furnished with a dining table, sofa, and beds, but I‚Äôll need to prioritize what to buy next to create a functional minimalist lifestyle for us. 

As I (48/M) purge my current home, I‚Äôve realized just how much stuff I own served no real purpose. It took me several trips to the local donation center just to make a sizable dent in everything I had accumulated over the years. This process has made me even more intentional about what I bring into my new home.

For those of you who‚Äôve made a similar move, if you had to start over again with only the essentials, what would be at the top of your must-buy list? Are there any purchases you regret or wish you had prioritized differently?

A few things I know I‚Äôll need as I settle in:

- Basic kitchen essentials

- Bedding and towels

- Storage/organization solutions

- Lighting 

- Small appliances like an electric kettle and microwave. 

I‚Äôm planning to live car-free, so I‚Äôd also love recommendations for practical ways to transport groceries, run errands, and navigate daily life by bike or public transit.

I Miss Nothing,"Hey everyone, just wanted to give my quick experience with downsizing over the past 2 years... 

I understand lots of this won't apply to most of you, but the principle hopefully will. I'm 22M, and I still live at home (I'm very grateful to still live with my mom, while I'm finishing my transition into law enforcement full-time). My girlfriend and I are planning to move into our own place by the end of the year, while she continues paramedic school.

I grew up with very little money, thankfully my mother really persevered, and we're doing better now. However, I grew a notorious habit of hoarding, and collecting garbage. ANYTHING that I thought I might need one day, I kept. I would bring things home I found on the side of the road, I would collect literal garbage (empty energy drink cans, old computer parts, etc)...

Over the past few years, I've really been pushing to build a good career and future for myself, and hopefully for my girlfriend as well. But pushing myself to get rid of my ""collecting"" was hard. 

I've finally made the last push recently to get rid of almost everything left that I own that isn't ""functional"" in some way. And I can safely say, I miss NOTHING! There's not a single thing I've donated, or thrown away that I regret. Sentimental items, items I ""may need"" one day, etc. I kept one collection, which still allows me to feed that urge to ""bring something home"" (Pop Vinyls, for those wondering. The one thing I allow myself to bring in that isn't functional in any real way)...

I may not have had a whole house of stuff to go through, but I had a lot. Probably enough to fill a basement apartment with random items...

Since following a minimal-ish lifestyle, I feel way less anxious. I enjoy a clean space, and feel like I have a huge weight off my shoulders. I cam move everything I own into a UHaul within probably 2 hours when I'm ready. I feel like I have a great place to start when I move out, and I feel like I truly conquered most of my ""hoarding"" tendencies... And the biggest thing I learned is: 

You Won't Miss That Item!

Things I held onto for years, I threw away, and never thought of again. I never did ""need"" the majority of the things I saved. And if I DO need something, I buy 1 as needed... I now feel confident getting rid of items, and I have never actually had a feeling of regret after getting rid of something.

Since then I've been slowing getting through my fridge, freezer, and pantry foods. I think I have about a week's worth of food left, down to a few cans of beans, cans of tomatoes, some sardines, pre-assembled frozen fruits for smoothies, meal replacements, and pasta. 2 and a half months without grocery shopping might seem like a long time but the process has been prolonged by business trips and complementary meals at my work gigs.

I admit, **the temptation to go grocery shopping before next weekend is strong**, but I think I want to wait out of principle, and because I've managed to last this long anyway.

The feeling of starting fresh with an empty fridge and freezer next week is pretty exciting. I also hope to start a routine of only having 3 days worth of perishables and only 7 days worth of frozen & canned foods moving forward.

Being in my 40s, I've gotten better at buying food purposefully with recipes in mind, rather than grabbing something off the shelf and think, ""I might be in the mood for this someday.""

As a side, it does annoy me to have anything expired in my kitchen, so it was gratifying to purge my spice rack of spices with best-by dates from a decade ago. Gosh knows I BARELY used my poultry seasoning.

I've kept them for purposes of reflection, to remember moments I don't want to forget.

Now I'm feeling like I should purge them because I know full well my spouse and I hardly ever watch movies. This is just one example of my thought process when it come to items. 

I've also have a spouse who frustrates me when it comes to certain items. Power cords for the cell phone and tools are the main issues, he likes to keep cords ""just in case"". I know full well we will never use these cords. I do feel like keeping a back up is okay. But not multiples of one type. As for tools, again, keeping duplicates even the cruddy ones. 

I made the mistake of calling him a hoarder, which I really regreted and I apologized for, because in reality he doesn't really have that much stuff. Sometimes we but heads about this. I just want to be free of excess stuff. Any advice on all of this?",minimalism,1741406556.0

How I approach minimalism in my life.,"I've noticed that a lot of folks in this wonderful community have a somewhat different view on what minimalism is about. With that in mind, I want to chip in with my own perspective on this subject. I'll keep it minimal. :)

Most posts on here tend to relate to buying/not buying or getting rid of physical stuff, but, to me, minimalism starts with your mindset. It's a certain culture of thinking. It's about managing your expectations and being content with you have -- not just in terms of physical items but also life in general, with all its happenings.

I find decluttering and keeping my mind neatly ordered is much more important than applying the same to my wardrobe or desk, which is merely a byproduct of my minimalism, and not its main feature.

To illustrate my point: when I come across, say, a piece of news, I try to ingest it neutrally without judgement -- as if I'm an independent observer looking in from the outside and just taking note of things. I'm not into any particular paradigm (as far as politics, religion, philosophy, or anything else, really), which tremendously helps in keeping negative thoughts out or quickly filtering them out. No, I'm not a robot, but I've conditioned my mind well enough to be emotionally unaffected by events that I don't have control over.

P.S. Regarding the ownership of physical goods -- yes, I enjoy having as few of those as I practically need, too. It just gives me a nice overall sense of order, complements my mental approach. :)",minimalism,1741361898.0
Getting rid of mostly everything,"So I'm a father of two and married. I started on this journey a couple years ago getting rid my entire cd collection, which was nearing 1,000 cds. Next I started on books and made a goal for myself not to buy anything else until I finally reached the end. I'm still not at the end but getting very near it now. I've periodically got rid of old collections, vinyls, game collections, etc. I have to say I am happier with less things and I enjoy not buying needless things when I travel. I had a sense of an epiphany when I was buying clothing to impress others rather than myself. What has caused this though? I had various collections through the years but would never say it got insane. I would like to hear other peoples journey to getting rid of things. ",minimalism,1741358632.0

New to minimalism. Something I just learned at 26 years old,"I saw someone mention ""maximalist"" a long time ago, and I just assumed what it was. Didn't think much of it. I randomly thought of it today and decided to get an answer per Google. So apparently, maximalism brings together colors, patterns, designs, etc. And yes it also involves a lot of stuff. 

So relating to society, I grew up around people who color and style matched everything. It was heavily normalized from the people around me, businesses, and entertainment. So basically today I just found out that color scheming and buying stuff for the house that matches is considered maximalism. Bathroom sets, bedroom sets, livingroom sets, and many more. Seems sort of ""duh"" but I have a lot of conditioning to unlearn.

I think that minimalism should be the default way of living, and not based on marketing or societal views. It's really weird to realize that all the thoughts I've had about ""that won't match so I can't buy that"" or nearly buying entire sets because I wanted my home to be a filled with aeathetic stuff, was just maximalism the entire time.

A Long-term Approach to Choosing Electronics,"These days we're overwhelmed with electronic products, with new models coming out every year that tempt us to impulse buy. In the past, fewer choices made decisions easier. Now, with so many options available, it takes careful thought to choose what truly suits us.

I used Android phones before switching to iPhone last year. While expensive at first, I've found the ecosystem really convenient, especially how devices work together seamlessly. It feels worth it.

For apps, I prefer simple designs with solid functionality. Once I find something that works, I stick with it rather than constantly switching. This lets me focus more on what I actually want to do.

Sometimes I think it's better to buy something more expensive but genuinely useful, rather than lots of cheaper things that don't work as well.",minimalism,1741245442.0

Minimalism in new parenthood,"I‚Äôm struggling with buying so many things after becoming a mom!

Getting rid of retro collection,"Hello everyone, I've been trying to work towards minimalism, a problem I have is being sentimental about junk.

It's one of the first portable computers and a piece of history but I have to keep reminding myself I'll never use it or do repairs/maintenance. I also have a big heavy 80's vintage digital oscilloscope that I never use, it's also a big heavy block. I want to also sell it but I keep convincing myself I might use it for learning more about electronics, but I no longer have the mental function (burnout from retail work/caffeine/nicotine addiction) to use it. I also have an Atari 2600 which isn't so big and heavy and everything fits in a shoe box. I like the idea that I have something ""more retro"" than another item so I can sell off the less retro items. Also have an old 80s function generator, I don't really want it anyways. I can always buy nicer ones in the future if I ever have a use for them. Anyone else cleaning out their vintage collections?

Rant: kids toys etc.,"Hello, so this is very much a rant but I need talk about this just to get it (mostly frustration) out of my head. 

I'm visiting my brother in another country and he has 2 young kids (under 7 years). Now, I'm childfree but I know kids stuff can get to a lot, especially when parents are financially okay. Now, all this is just part of a cultural shock for me, given I don't spend time around kids in my regular life + I'm quite minimalist otherwise as well. I'm sure a lot/all of this is probably already been discussed in the community but I just need to rant and I don't have any other place to do so. If it breaks any community rules, I'll delete the post. 

RANT: 

1. Quantity and choices-  Just the amount and types of coloring things, for example. I grew up in a different time and in a different socio-economic place, but I can remember having a set of sketchpens and a couple of sets of crayons/paints and being so excited about them. The degree of choices available to kids these days is overwhelming to me. 


2. Return gifts- I've been here a little over a week and one of the kids has been to a couple of birthday parties during this time. The return gifts they get from parties - omg. So many tiny cheap plastic things. I know a lot of this is a product of time and place, and parents (like everyone else) ofcourse repeat what they largely see around them, but just from 2 parties the kids got so many little things. They get excited about it for 2 hours and then they're ofcourse forgotten. They've collected so many of the same types of things because of just the return gifts they've gotten over the years. 


This is all I've noticed in the week I've been here and it's been overwhelming to say the least. I don't know how/whether it affects the kids psycholocally and I don't know if there are positive elements to it, but it isn't surprising to me that adults end up becoming so consumerist by default. Even grocery stores like Walmart/Costco are same, targetted towards adults. I can now understand that it can take a lot of self control for most people to not spend frivolously here (provided they have money to be frivolous about). I'm very conscious about buying normally but here, even I've had to really impulse control myself in grocery stores. ",minimalism,1741116639.0

minimalist sleeping arrangement for floor sleeping,"I‚Äôve been thinking I wanna sleep on the floor. 

Goal: Most barebones minimalist yet effective solution. Priority is posture and physical health

I think if I just slept on the floor maybe it‚Äôll accumulate bodily oils or whatever. So I need something that prevents that. Like maybe some cloth on top that‚Äôs equivalent to a bunch of bedsheets all in one.

When It's Not a Choice but a Necessity,"Minimalism sometimes isn't a lifestyle choice, but rather a necessity forced by circumstances.

Back home, my parents would fill our house with countless possessions. Perhaps it was because we had plenty of space, or maybe it was their generation's desire for material abundance. Now, living away from home, I rent a 35-square-meter apartment in the city center. While the space is small and expensive, it unexpectedly led me to discover a different way of living.

The spatial constraints forced me to learn organization, and more importantly, to control the influx of items from the source. In my kitchen, for example, I only have an air fryer and a cooking pot, which sufficiently meet my daily cooking needs.

The biggest change has been in my wardrobe. I used to think I needed lots of clothes for different combinations, but now I wonder: why do humans need so many clothes? It's not just about space - it's wasteful and environmentally harmful.

So I started buying quality basic pieces. I only get one of each style, but I invest more in pants and outerwear because quality matters for frequently worn items. Gradually, I fell in love with mix-and-match styling: today it's pants A with top A and jacket B, tomorrow it becomes pants A with top B. Friends think I have lots of clothes, but it's really just different combinations of a few pieces.

This minimalism, which started out of necessity, has given me a clearer understanding of ""wants"" versus ""needs."" It's like looking at a coffee shop's elaborate menu - when you know you just love iced Americano, all those fancy options become unnecessary.

Minimalism has taught me that less is more. It's not just environmentally friendly; it brings clarity to life. When we truly understand what we need, we can live a richer life with less.",minimalism,1741054825.0

"""Want Grief"" - Have You Experienced This?","I believe my experience of ""Want Grief"" is likely common to minimalists. Here is a short explanation:

I've experienced it after long stretches of time building my identity around wanting something... A career, a object, a state of being... Then no matter if I achieve the goal or not... Eventually I change. I simply no longer want this formerly covetous thing. I experience ""Want Grief"" for the loss of the enjoyable state of being driven to make something happen. 

I'm in the second half of my life so I have more experience seeing this pattern play out than I did in my driven young adulthood. I forgive anyone who can't imagine not wanting ""The thing"". But the corner office, the sports car, the white whale collectible... You might change priorities and stop wanting them. No matter if you accomplish the goal or not. That shift in identity can be a loss. Grieving the loss of such an important mental construction is totally okay. 

I think minimalists don't sufficiently acknowledge how sorrowful it can feel to not want stuff... childhood toys, heirlooms or the big house anymore. I experience a lot of ""What was this all for?"" Feelings. 

Have you ever experienced ""Want Grief"" in this way? How did you process it?

Every winter/around the holidays my mom buys yet another jacket. I‚Äôve learned there‚Äôs no converting to be done there, so she shows me and I tell her it looks nice, I like the color, the pockets seem roomy and useful, whatever. Without fail my parents jump on that and urge me to ask for the same coat for Christmas because they don‚Äôt think I have a nice coat.

I have 2 coats (probably seems excessive to some here, but it‚Äôs bad to wash them too often). I have a brown coat for doing outdoorsy things with my dog, it‚Äôs always covered in paw prints and burrs. I have a blue coat for going to work and social events (hopefully doesn‚Äôt smell like dog).

My older futon mattress had a thin cotton container. I like the thin cotton container more because it is softer and it seems to me that it will breath better. Am I wrong in this thinking? Or is the canvas material supposed to be better?  ",minimalism,1740768726.0
Question for people with minimal wardrobes: how long does your stuff actually last?,"For instance if you own one week's worth of clothing and you wash all your clothes every week, how long until you have to replace them? How about if you own 2 or 3 weeks of clothing? It's obvious how often you have to do laundry with different amounts of clothes, but I don't have a sense of how fast things wear out when you don't have much and are constantly washing the same things over and over. I like the idea of a minimal wardrobe and I'm definitely downsizing from where I started, but I don't want to go so far that I have to go shopping and replace things constantly. I want space and simplicity but I'm used to basically never having to shop because if one thing wears out I already have a replacement for it in my closet. ",minimalism,1740766149.0

Practical minimalistic wandrobe,"""Hello everyone. I'm still quite inexperienced when it comes to minimalism and I'm facing a problem. I come from a poor family and over the years I've accumulated a lot of clothing. 80% of it was gifted to me by relatives and friends who didn't need the items anymore. Unfortunately, I still have the mentality that I might need these things someday or should keep them for harder times. As a result, my wardrobe is very crowded and I'm losing track of what I have. All this stuff is also weighing on my mind and I feel like I never have peace of mind. Every time I try to declutter, I wonder about the criteria for sorting out clothing. Quality/brand of clothing? Basics? Practicality? I don't want to only wear black, white, and beige, but I also know it doesn't make sense to have clothing in my wardrobe that I can't combine in the end. How have you managed this? How many clothing items do you have? Which clothing items have proven to be useful for you? I would like to do a thorough decluttering once and for all, rather than every year or every few months. Do you find that unrealistic?",minimalism,1740754961.0
"Overwhelmed by ""Stuff"" - Seeking Minimalist Guidance.","
I'm struggling. I've been drawn to the minimalist philosophy for a while, but I keep falling into the trap of buying things ‚Äì often unnecessary things. It's like a constant cycle: I feel the urge to acquire, I buy, I feel temporary satisfaction, then I'm left with clutter and a sense of guilt.
I understand the core principles of minimalism, but I'm having trouble translating them into consistent action. I think I might be dealing with some underlying issues related to impulse control or emotional spending.
Has anyone else experienced this? How did you break the cycle? What practical strategies or mindset shifts helped you overcome the urge to buy? I'm looking for actionable advice and maybe some personal stories to help me get back on track.
Thanks in advance.

How do you decide if you are going to love the garment you‚Äôre buying for years to come?,"Sic. I struggle with figuring out if something I really like this season would make me as excited next year. I don‚Äôt really believe in buying timeless classic pieces because at this point it totally feels like a marketing ploy - people shop for timeless things every other year. Plus, I came across this take that there‚Äôs no timeless things really because, for instance, if you compare some classic man suit from 40s and some modern one, those would be two pieces that differ in smaller details making one of them actually time-specific. I really disagree with this idea that you cannot grow bored of classics. The piece may stay relevant within current fashion context, but it doesn‚Äôt mean that I won‚Äôt grow bored of it.

Does anyone who adopted minimalism just feel free? Simply weightless from not wanting more stuff?,"My whole life all I wanted was stuff. I went to business school and got into a ton of debt to be able to earn more and buy more meaningless things. I took out as many loans as I could to finance a bunch of stuff I could not afford. I got eyeballs deep in debt to fill a void that I did not know existed. In 2019 I read a book called essentialism, I bought in immediately and never looked back. I sold all my stuff including house and expensive cars, got out of debt and only buy things that are essential to my life and usually when I buy something, something I already own has to leave. Honestly I never thought not having a lot could make me this happy but the peace I have is way more important than what people think. I could not be more grateful for this lifestyle.

What misunderstandings have you faced because of minimalism?,"When I first started practicing minimalism, people often assumed that it meant I was just trying to save money, so they thought I was cheap or didn‚Äôt care about quality. Some even got the idea that I was lazy or not making enough of an effort to improve my life.

Question about Shikibuton Futon materials,"This community seems to have a lot of posts about futons, so I‚Äôll try asking here:

Looking to get a futon and going in circles trying to decide on an ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù Japanese shikibuton made of all cotton, vs. a futon made of synthetic materials.

I‚Äôm OK with paying money for quality, but my main question is this: Is there anything inherently ‚Äúbetter‚Äù about a shikibuton made in the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù and ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù Japanese way using tight knit, all natural cotton fibers, vs. a more ‚Äúmodern‚Äù futon using a combination of ‚Äúspace age‚Äù materials, like polyester, foam, latex, etc?

It seems like traditional shikibuton have issues with lumping, and need a lot of care and maintenance, and are expensive, whereas I‚Äôm not sure what the downside of synthetic materials is besides not being ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù and ‚Äútraditional‚Äù.  Is it concerns about off-gassing and VOCs and destroying the planet?  Is it breathability?  Is it deterioration or flattening over time?  All of the above?",minimalism,1740545254.0

Do you buy a back up of some things?,"So, I am returning to the office full time and most of the outfits I had were casual and now i have to look to wear professional. I lean towards a mature 30 something young lady style and like it alot more than my 20s style. I also have sold 100+ items since the last two years of my office style pre-covid and finally my closet is SO clean and i adore it.

Heres my issue: I have these two pants that are my go to pants in grey and black and go with everything. I go online to order the same style size in the navy blue, bc 5 days a week is alot and I figure an extra pair wont hurt?

anyways, well, it arrives and i guess the manufacterer messed with sizing bc its legit way bigger in the waist, the cut looks slightly bigger, and the one i order from a few yrs ago fit way better! 

I am devastated they messed with the style! now my paranoia is kicking in, what if the pair i have  (esp the grey one, its my fav and now discontinued color!) gets messed up, torn, or worn out in the 5 days work week, what if I spill my lunch on it, clearly its limited edition and my paranoia is coming on to buy one backup on ebay, bc its my favorite pant and I am terrified. Then i start to think what if i gain weight, then i have no use for it- but then if i gain weight I can sell on ebay.

The [comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/1ixeva8/realized_my_minimalism_had_become_another_form_of/melxncd/) by u/Fly-Astronaut also seem to be a perfectly normal comment which unfortunately people do these days, i.e. talk to a chatbot as form of Therapy.

The sad part about that is, these two accounts are carefully designing their posts, most likely with help of a chatbot and putting it here and dropping their own chatbot in disguise of helping deal with complex thoughts.

i always get so manic a few times a year; i managed to give away my old books ive already gone through and donate them and clothes and reuse shit and then toss em, after multiple years ive cut down my possessions to the point where i could basically stuff all my shit in my SUV, minus furniture of course. im glad i have less crap, i really dont need all that. thinking about owning knick knacks or being in a house that's just so convuluted and filled with so much shit is so stressful. nobody needs to own that much or consume that much. 

  
after cutting down and only keeping the very very necessary stuff (and a box of sentimentals), my mind went to digital clutter and god. its just so gross. i feel sick just thinking about it. i know its not the same, like i can turn off my shit and have it disappear but its THERE. its still THERE. whenever i turn on a device i know that in the gallery or folders or logging in via google that im entering a space where i have so much unneccesary things. its like more stressful bc most of the photos i have in my gallery are MEMES. literal memes. thousands of memes from during lockdown. stupid screenshots of dumb ass conversations; i dont even remember why i still have them im a fucking adult now i dont need to have screenshots of ancient group chats or these outdated ass memes, and so many of my photos are just blurry?? like my gallery is meant to be a GALLERY. not a dump. im envious of those who can just open up their gallery and be NORMAL. like maybe have screenshots of a schedule or an appointment or a receipt, selfies with the family/SO/friends, like how a gallery should be. like i have hundreds of screenshots from a tv show i used to be obsessed with LIKE WHYYY. HUNDREDS of photos i have to sift through. i still have screenshots of news from the obama adminsitration like i screenshotted that in middle school and I STILL have the screenshots. its not like owning a damn newspaper of the news which i could see how its sentimental but this is literally just PIXELS and im just so URGGGGh. im off tomorrow so im planning on completely fixing this. and its not just the tens of thousands of irrelevant photos, its also the tens of thousands of EMAILS i have to sift through. the multiple addresses. the social media clutter. 

oh and it isnt just my gallery too. i had autosave on so apparently i also have this clutter in my icloud storage as WELL as google photos like HOORAY FOR ME. if i wanna see a photo of me and my friend just to remember fond memories i dont want to have to like deal with all that. like in order to find a crucial photo i scroll the bar on the side ok ok... 2017... march 2017 ok... ok good i know its in march great... but jesus christ, of course, march has hundreds and hundreds of pop culture screenshots... great. and yeah i know i can search but sometimes they dont have words or sometimes i dont know exactly what they say and even if i type in a keyword, again, thousands of images with that word will show up. wont help at all.

From Owning a Room Full of Nordic-Style Decorations to Living with Just a Backpack: My Path to Extreme Minimalism,"# Links to the full article and photos:

\------

I think my current minimalist lifestyle shows some signs of regression. When I first flew to New Zealand, I only brought a backpack and a suitcase. Now after living here for several months, if I were to move again, I'd need an extra bag. I still want to simplify further - if the landlord would allow me to do laundry every day, I could minimize my clothes to just two sets.

The peak of my minimalist life was when I lived in that empty room in Nanning. In 2020, I specifically sought out a completely empty room without bed or cabinets. The landlord intended it as an office space - she didn't expect anyone would rent it to live in. After I moved in, she only installed a water heater, washing machine, and air conditioner. No other furniture or appliances.

All my storage was in shopping bags - one for clothes, one for sanitary pads and toilet paper, another for pots and miscellaneous items. I slept on a foam pad that cost about 80 yuan. After six months, I would cut it in half and join the unworn sides, which would last another half year. I even made a sofa from discarded foam pads.

The foam pad let me live like a plant, freely following the sun's path. When sunlight shone on the left side of the room, I would carry the pad there. When it moved right, I followed. At night, I could move to where moonlight came in - just lying there, watching the moon. It was quite satisfying.

My minimalist journey started differently though. My first solo apartment was filled with Instagram-worthy decorations - LED strips, wall art, plants, designer items. I even spent 99 yuan on a trash can just because it was pure white and looked stylish. With my modest salary, this quickly became unsustainable.

The turning point came when I threw away some broken charging cables. That moment showed me I could start with small things - broken hair clips, dirty soap holders, items that weren't painful to discard. Soon, I was inspecting my space like reviewing troops: decorative frames collecting dust, unused couch taking space, expensive plants hiding cockroaches - all could go.

I became increasingly practical. In the kitchen, I realized I only needed oil, salt, and soy sauce. My approach to food is purely nutritional - rice and noodles both count as carbohydrates, so one is enough. Meat contains protein and fat, so if I eat meat, I don't need milk. Now abroad, this practicality significantly reduces my expenses.

The process of discarding became addictive. Each item removed brought more fresh air and sunlight into my space, matching my aesthetic of ""emptiness as beauty."" This extended to my appearance too - I threw away dresses and makeup, shaved my head, and focused on practical clothing made of materials like polar fleece, coral fleece, and polyester. These fabrics are quick-drying, warm, windproof, wrinkle-resistant, and inexpensive. I find these more practical than materials like cotton, linen, or silk that require special care or take long to dry.

Eventually, this mindset expanded beyond physical items. I reduced social connections, keeping only current, meaningful ones. I even legally changed my name at 30, creating an identity free from past associations. I found that minimizing physical distance from certain relationships actually improved them - like with my mother, whom I now see once a year instead of living together in constant conflict.

I've learned that minimalism requires talent, but it's also a skill that can be trained. The moment you start throwing things away, you gain experience and develop new perspectives. Once the idea of discarding something enters your mind, that item becomes increasingly unsightly until you remove it.

Now, I focus solely on the present moment. I consider whether things, people, or ideas are useful to me right now. If they're not immediately useful, they should go. This applies to everything - from physical objects to relationships to anxieties about the future.

I don't particularly recommend my approach to others. This is simply my experience of finding what works for me. When someone tells me they want to buy a book about minimalism after hearing my story, I find it ironic - buying new things to learn about having less. I just suggest they try audiobooks instead.

I am torn between keeping my new soundbar or spending 2x and getting a pair of bookshelf speakers and a dedicated AVR.,"I love the design and look of my new Sony Soundbar I bought yesterday. It is my second day owning it and listening to music CDs via HDMI ARC/BD player is a game changer. My previous soundbar was good, but this sounds quite a bit better.

I'm hearing stuff I never really noticed before,and I don't know if changing to dedicated bookshelf speakers will be a downgrade since soundbar technology is always improving.

I'm listening to a few CDs again and it's a new experience (not just deeper bass), but new layers or subtle things that I never heard before. The Bluetooth function works but all my FLAC tracks sound like garbage through the soundbar.

I haven't tried a Blu-ray with True HD/DTS audio, but I suspect I will be blown away. It's too late to test out with movies with a good score or action like Dune 1/2 or The Dark Knight.

Buying external speakers will take up more physical space but it won't be physically in my way per se. Cost will be a small temporary issue/pain for me, but I don't if the bookshelfs will be good.",minimalism,1740197938.0
I need someone to give me permission to throw things out instead of donate. Or just advice.,I am fighting hoarding tendencies and am stressed out beyond belief. I have so much stuff in my house. Most of the underlayers of stuff is dirty and stained. I could easily wash some of it and donate. I am capable of fixing and donating broken jewelry that just came apart and isn't actually broken. I could clean the dirt and dust off of things. And most of the top layer is actually nice whole things I dont have to fix that someone would want. But it's so much. I dont want to do it. And I can't get to a donation center very well because of car issues and one center isn't even accepting any more right now. And I don't want the hassel and more stress of trying to sell. But I feel so bad and guilty for adding unnecessary things to a landfill just because I'm too lazy to fix them and too impatient to wait for my car.

- Crafting (sewing kit, needles/hooks)
- Shortlist of books of sentimental value

Minimalism's been great because, in cutting out all of the clutter, I'm able to physically access the resources to make the things I enjoy doing feel more accessible when I have a free moment, plus emotionally it's easier to say, ""I have a free moment, what should I do?"" and pick from one of the things I actually enjoy (rather than some distraction to pass the time).

"Drowning in Choices, Addicted to Stimulation","Ever feel like you‚Äôre consuming everything but absorbing nothing? Podcasts, movies, books, shows, TikToks, Reels‚Ä¶endless choices at our fingertips. You‚Äôd think having access to all this would make us happier and more fulfilled. Instead, we‚Äôre more overwhelmed, distracted, and mentally drained than ever.

More choices should mean more freedom, but instead, they create decision fatigue and anxiety.

The dopamine loop of constant novelty (scrolling, bingeing, jumping between hobbies) makes deep work and focus feel impossible.


Instant gratification from endless content leaves us mentally exhausted yet unsatisfied.

It‚Äôs not just entertainment‚Ä¶it‚Äôs everything. Aesthetics, knowledge, hobbies‚Ä¶there‚Äôs always something new, making it hard to commit, finish, or even enjoy things fully.

The Solution: Deep Dopamine & Structured Consumption

Instead of quitting cold turkey (which rarely works), the goal is to shift how we engage with our interests:
1.	Rotate, Don‚Äôt Hoard: Have a hobby/content cycle‚Ä¶.focus on a few things at a time instead of juggling everything at once.
2.	Delay the Hit: Before starting a new book, hobby, or show, wait 24 hours. If you still care, go for it. This filters out impulsive consumption.
3.	Consume Less, Create More: If you love aesthetics, make mood boards. If you love knowledge, summarize what you learn. Creating deepens engagement.
4.	Introduce Friction: Physical books over digital. Desktop YouTube instead of the app. Small barriers make consumption more mindful.
5.	Prioritize Completion: Your brain loves novelty‚Ä¶train it to love finishing instead of just starting. No new hobby or book until you complete the last one.


We‚Äôre not meant to process infinite choices. The key isn‚Äôt shutting out curiosity‚Ä¶it‚Äôs channeling it into things that actually fulfill us. Less dopamine chasing, more depth and presence.

Embracing Simplicity in a World of Excess,"Lately, I've been reflecting on how much clutter‚Äîboth physical and mental‚Äîaffects my life. When I first started my minimalism journey, it felt overwhelming to let go of so many things. But now, I feel lighter, more focused, and truly content with less.

Here are a few lessons I've learned so far:

1) Quality over Quantity ‚Äì It's not about owning fewer things, but owning things that truly add value to my life.

2) Mental Declutter ‚Äì Letting go of negative thought patterns and unnecessary obligations has been just as important as decluttering my home.

3) Intentional Living ‚Äì By making intentional choices, I feel more in control of my time, my space, and my energy.

4) Growth through Simplicity ‚Äì Minimalism isn't about restriction; it's about creating room for what truly matters‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs relationships, experiences, or self-improvement.

 Anyone else here in the process of simplifying? I'd love to hear your stories and how you‚Äôve embraced minimalism!

Digital video/audio project decluttering,"I am very much in over my head with digital clutter and desperately need advice.

A little about me: I am 29 and I've been making random little music and video projects since I was 14. I have AuDHD and over time I have amassed a ridiculous amount of files, some organized and some not, but a large majority of them are important in some way. I have a 2Tb hard drive that has about 1.3Tb full right now - some of these files are photos, but a big chunk of them are video and audio files.

I am an artist and musician, but I also have a day job and making music is something I do as a creative hobby. Regardless, it's my passion and I am extremely attached to the things I make. Unfortunately, because I work and have limited time to do hobbies, I rarely actually finish anything I start. I also have a bad habit of recording large durations of video/audio on my phone without labeling them, leading to hundreds of hours of unlabeled digital content.

My biggest issue regarding my file collection is that I have no way to assess which files are important without sitting down and watching/listening to all of them. I write original songs, but for many of the songs I've written the only known recording I have is lost somewhere within a random unnamed video/audio files on this massive drive. Additionally, I am trans and started medically transitioning on testosterone 3 years ago, so I have recorded a ridiculous amount of videos documenting my progress as a singer. These videos and audios are very sentimental to me, but I know they are mixed in with many files that include bad takes or multiple recordings of the same thing.

This problem is also my motivation to declutter my massive collection, but it just feels impossible to actually accomplish and maintain. I know I need to be better about labeling files when I create them, but I haven't found a system that actually works that I can stick to. I've tried having ""MASTER"" file folders, but then I end up making multiple ""MASTER"" folders in different locations which defeats the purpose.

I've tried automating the process by using the Everything program, using batch file labeling software, etc. This has helped quite a bit with my photos specifically, but the videos are another issue entirely. With photos, I can open one up and instantly identify what it is and whether it's important. But with videos and audio, I feel the need to sit and listen to each one and compare it with every other version to decide which is the best recording I have of any given song.

I'm so sick and tired of not being able to find what I'm looking for when I want it. I've made amazing projects in Audacity or Shortcut that I'm really proud of, only to be unable to locate them later. I've written so many songs that have been lost in the sea of files. I have no way of easily accessing my best work; therefore, it feels like it's lost forever.

Does anyone have any advice or steps I can take? I'm really resistant to an all-or-nothing approach due to the sentimental nature of my art and the fact that a mass deletion won't actually fix the root issue.",minimalism,1739808706.0

As you may have had just a pile of miscellaneous junk before you may now have a pile of miscellaneous junk and you now have a storage bin to go along with it not only does it become something else you own it also takes up space and costs money.

Simple outdoor adventure layering: a lesson from Yvon Chouinard,"This post will land with a very unique niche. I am three things, perhaps in this order. 

1. A serial outdoor hobbyist
2. A gear nerd
3. A minimalist

In all of those things Yvon Chouinard and Patagonia have been a present and heavy influence. I have been a climber, mountain guide, fly fisherman, triathlete, trail runner, peak bagger, backpacker. 

The tension in being invested in a variety of hobbies lies in the accumulation of gear. I have always wrestled with this. To quote Yvon, ‚Äúhe who dies with the least toys wins.‚Äù

I spent a few summers guiding, and the director of our outfitter had a pretty consistent uniform. The most noteworthy aspect of this was that he had a matching vest and jacket. 

His was the Arcteryx Atom LT Hoody and Atom LT vest, both black. This struck me as genius and I have become an advocate for this method. A few advantages to this. 

1. Aesthetic consistency
2. Adaptability (I think an insulated vest is more versatile and can replace a fleece in a layering system)
3. Performance (if you like how the jacket performs, why wouldn‚Äôt you like the vest as well)

Only recently have I recognized that Yvon Chouinard also had adopted this method, as seen in the movie 180¬∞ south. That movie inspired my quest for adventure and my desire to be minimalist and die with the least toys. 

This could work with any product line that offers both a jacket and a vest. Nano puff, nano air, arcteryx Atom, Sitka Kelvin to name a few. I have found immense value out of the ease it has provided for me. 

Hope this resonates with someone!",minimalism,1739769729.0
"New lesson learnt: Stuff is just stuff (not my/your stuff). We don't need to give it an identity, rather use stuff as just a tool to address needs.","I had posted a question in the community yesterday regarding my dilemma about adding new stuff and practising minimalism. 

I received two different opinions. Some suggesting I should dissociate my identity from stuff (absolutely correct), while others said I can add some quality pieces. 
What I realised is that many were writing 'your' stuff which made me wonder, well when we write your/my in front of it that automatically generates a feeling of ownership. While in reality, stuff has been made to only fulfill needs. 
Maybe you live in a country with tropical climate and are travelling to a region with snowfall, ofcourse you need to invest in getting some gear to protect yourself. For me, I transitioned from being a student to a working professional and my needs have changed. 

I get it that we shouldn't give into consumerism, but sometimes stuff is just needed to fulfill certain needs and that's what we should look at it like- a tool to fulfill needs, neither good nor bad. Giving lifeless things an identity and ownership is unnecessary. Now, I don't mean this in a grammatical way, rather a philosophical way. A coat is needed to protect me from wind, shoes are needed to help me walk comfortably. If the pair of shoes you have doesn't cater to your need, it's fair to purchase another fair. This also helps in not clinging to stuff, rather using it as a mere tool. ",minimalism,1739763214.0

Over the past few years, I‚Äôve been feeling increasingly overwhelmed by the amount of stuff I own, especially my clothes. I have a lot of pieces that I rarely wear, and I really want to declutter‚Äîbut I struggle to let go because I‚Äôve spent a lot of money on them.

For context: I‚Äôve always leaned towards minimalism and only buy high-quality items, which means I‚Äôve invested quite a bit in my wardrobe. I‚Äôve been selling on Vinted and have managed to get rid of a lot, but there are still plenty of pieces left. The issue is that I don‚Äôt have a lot of money, so it feels painful to simply donate items that still hold value (on average, around ‚Ç¨50 per piece on the secondhand market).

Another problem is that selling on Vinted means I‚Äôm constantly saving boxes and packaging materials, which just adds to the clutter. So while I‚Äôm trying to clear out my space, I feel like I‚Äôm creating a new kind of mess.

Has anyone else dealt with this? How did you navigate the financial side of letting go? Would love to hear your thoughts!",minimalism,1739742542.0
What do I tell my parents asking what I want for my birthday?,"I don‚Äôt spend much on myself, and feel like most my needs are met well. If I was to buy something, I would spend a LOT of time researching about it, and it would be too expensive to ask someone else to get me. 

At the moment, I don‚Äôt even have one of those things that I currently desire. My parents want to be nice and know me well enough that they want me to actually have something I want, rather than try and guess. 

Except I don‚Äôt know what that could be. What‚Äôs something you would like for your birthday? I wouldn‚Äôt ask them to spend a lot more than a 100 bucks. ",minimalism,1739731470.0
Advice for living with a non-minimalists,"I would like to start by saying I'm not a hardcore minimalist. I do my best to only buy/have what I need. I need to have a logical reason when purchasing something new. I really enjoy having everything tidy and each item has it's own place. I realized my anxiety went down when I started doing this years ago.

Now I live with my partner who describes his childhood as not having a lot of money. He keeps EVERYTHING!! He still has letters his ex wrote him when they were in high school.  (They were kind of high school sweethearts and got married really early. They have been divorced for about 8 years). He's 35 now. To clarify, it doesn't bother me he has letters from an ex. I'm pretty sure he  doesn't remember having them. I found them when i was cleaning. I want to share this example of how he does keep everything. He has several coffee mugs, but he only uses the same three. He also never throws away his mail. This is probably my biggest pet peeve. I looked through his pile of mail (with his permission). He had cards from his mother, and at least two save the dates that were never opened. One of those save the dates was for a wedding that had already happened.

We have two different relationships with items. At times it can create some tension. Is there a balance here that we can create? I think both of us will have to compromise. Any thoughts or advice on that?",minimalism,1739728224.0
The Secret to Minimalism? Gratitude.,"I‚Äôve been on a minimalism journey for a while now, and I‚Äôve come to realize that the true key to embracing minimalism isn‚Äôt just decluttering‚Äîit‚Äôs gratitude.

When you appreciate what you already have, you stop feeling the need to constantly chase more. You recognize that happiness doesn‚Äôt come from accumulating things but from valuing what‚Äôs already in your life. Gratitude shifts your mindset from ‚ÄúI need more‚Äù to ‚ÄúI have enough.‚Äù

Minimalism isn‚Äôt about deprivation; it‚Äôs about intentionality. It‚Äôs about keeping what truly adds value and letting go of the excess that distracts from what matters. And when you cultivate gratitude, you naturally start needing (and wanting) less.

Anyone else feel like gratitude has helped them on their minimalism journey? Would love to hear your thoughts!

"Minimalism, Family, War and my lessons","Original post is located [**here**](https://lukin.io/blog/minimalism-war-family-and-lessons) with photos.

In 2014, I decided to move to Kyiv, Ukraine. I had a great opportunity to work on an interesting project that integrated with the UK police force to help fight crime. When I moved to Ukraine, I brought only one medium-sized suitcase and a small laptop. At that time, I didn‚Äôt realize how valuable and manageable that amount of stuff could be. Back then, I hadn‚Äôt even heard of minimalism.

However, I was a big fan of the movie¬†*Up in the Air*¬†with George Clooney, especially a couple of quotes like this one:

*‚ÄúHow much does your life weigh? Imagine for a second that you‚Äôre carrying a backpack. I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders. Feel ‚Äôem? Now I want you to pack it with all the stuff that you have in your life. You start with the little things. The things on shelves and in drawers, the knick-knacks, the collectibles. Feel the weight as that adds up. Then you start adding larger stuff, clothes, table-top appliances, lamps, linens, your TV.*

*The backpack should be getting pretty heavy now. And you go bigger. Your couch, bed, your kitchen table. Stuff it all in there. Your car, get it in there. Your home, whether it‚Äôs a studio apartment or a two-bedroom house. I want you to stuff it all into that backpack. Now try to walk. It‚Äôs kind of hard, isn‚Äôt it? This is what we do to ourselves on a daily basis. We weigh ourselves down until we can‚Äôt even move. And make no mistake, moving is living.*

*Now, I‚Äôm gonna set that backpack on fire. What do you want to take out of it? Photos? Photos are for people who can‚Äôt remember. Drink some ginkgo and let the photos burn. In fact, let everything burn and imagine waking up tomorrow with nothing. It‚Äôs kind of exhilarating, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù*

**My ‚Äúbackpack‚Äù was set on fire at 4:30 in the early morning of February 24, 2022, in Kyiv, Ukraine. The war had begun.**

I woke up to the sound of explosions and rockets (the entire sky was crisscrossed with rockets and Russian jets). Immediately, my wife and I began preparing our bags, gathering clothes, documents, passports, and some cash in one place.

At the same time, I started doing a kind of ‚Äúafter-action review‚Äù (a habit from my software engineering background, where I constantly analyze how to improve some processes).¬†  
I realized some good practices, patterns, and habits that could be useful in everyday life. Stress can negatively impact logical thinking, so many useful actions or items can be overlooked. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to do the right things at the right time, later one it might be much ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù.

With multiple bags, our 10-month-old son, a cat, and a baby stroller, we tried to evacuate by train. At the time, most roads were blocked by tanks and active assault operations (including aviation), so the train was the only way out‚Äîexcept for one problem: millions of people had the same idea. The trains became so overcrowded that the only way for police to manage the chaos was to fire shots into the air (yes, like in a zombie movie).

We realized we were stuck.

With our baby in a hip carrier, two laptops, two suitcases, and a backpack, my wife carried our cat and another backpack. The air raid sirens blared non-stop, and explosions continued somewhere in the city. We had to return home; boarding the train was impossible.

That night, rocket attacks continued without pause, and logistics hubs and grocery warehouses were destroyed. Cash ran out at ATMs, and with the cellular network failing, cash became the only way to pay for essentials.

I realized one thing: food was running out, including baby food. Enemy tanks and aircraft were getting closer, and more roads were blocked. We started sleeping in our apartment‚Äôs corridor, following the¬†[‚Äúrule of two walls‚Äù](https://delano.lu/article/the-rule-of-two-walls-and-othe)¬†(which, as we later learned, doesn‚Äôt work well against powerful weapons). I also failed to find a gun to defend my family from marauders, even though AK-like riffles were scattered on the streets due to daily shootings or given by GOVs to defent capital.

I knew we had to try again. Thankfully, we got lucky and managed to board a train. I had never seen so many people in one place. The train was so crowded that it moved at 20 km/h instead of the usual 80+ km/h, and the trip took 20-25 hours instead of 10h. My big toe lost sensation because of the cold‚ÄîI stood for the entire trip without sleep, food, or water.

My wife stayed in the warmer middle part of the train with our baby, while I stayed on the stairs with our luggage, laptops, and backpacks. An elderly woman warned me, ‚ÄúOh my‚Ä¶ so many bags‚Äîyou‚Äôre in trouble. People at the next stops will try to throw your bags (and you) off the train to get in‚Äù

I immediately started planning which bags bag I could sacrifice first. The baby stroller was the obvious choice‚Äîit had no documents or money inside‚Äîso I left it between the train cars. I understood that my luggage wasn‚Äôt blocking anyone‚Äôs way, but in moments of panic, logic disappears, people will do anything to survive.

At each stop, I fought to keep my small space on the train with my family. After 20-25 hours, we finally arrived in Lviv, far from encircled Kyiv (though we didn‚Äôt know that rockets would hit Lviv the next morning).

We decided to go to Poland (I still think the Polish people are true heroes). We rented a hotel (which was nearly impossible to get because all hotels were full of refugees) and eventually flew back to Central Asia.

A month or two later, we returned back to Kyiv.¬†  
The Russian army had left the city, and air defense improved.¬†  
Sadly, we got used to hundreds of rocket and drone attacks, sometimes daily. This became the ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù (like a plan to go for a shopping might be canceled because of air raid alert or drone attack, or midnight ballistic rocket wakes you up).

# What I Learned About Minimalism:

1. **Before buying something, ask yourself: Do I really need this? If you can‚Äôt decide, the answer is no**¬†(works in any area of your life).
2. **YAGNI (**[***You Ain‚Äôt Gonna Need It***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAGNI)**):**¬†A principle from software engineering that I‚Äôve applied to life. It simplifies decision-making.
3. **Pragmatic living and constant audits everything:**¬†Regularly review your time, belongings (any things you have), habits. This has helped me manage my life and my family‚Äôs needs effectively. If you haven‚Äôt used something in 3‚Äì6 months, get rid of it.
4. **Choose multi-purpose clothing:**¬†Brands like Columbia or Asics offer versatile clothing and footwear for all seasons. A simple three-layer can keep you warm in winter and adaptable in all seasons or use each layer for each season, it can be worn for work, sports, and casual outings, daily basis.
5. **Digital over physical:**¬†Buy digital versions of games and books (my Kindle is one of the best devices I own).
6. **Grab-and-go bag:**¬†If you live near ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù (war zones, volcanoes, earthquake-prone areas, etc.), prepare a bag with essentials: passports, cash, silver blankets, water, protein bars, and essential medications (Check ‚Äòbest before date‚Äô monthly). Prepare it in calm times so you don‚Äôt forget anything under stress.
7. **Invest in knowledge, health, and relationships:**¬†Minimalism isn‚Äôt about deprivation‚Äîit‚Äôs about focusing on what truly matters.

# Additional Lessons:

* **Diversify your assets:**¬†Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. Having 2-3 passports, properties, and bank accounts in different countries is a smart idea. Start today.
* **After-action reviews (**[**AAR**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After-action_review)**):**¬†Regularly analyze your actions and decisions to improve efficiency in all aspects of life.
* **Create patterns and rules:**¬†Develop habits and workflows that work best for you, for your daily stuff, it saves time and reduce stress by not keeping that in your mind.

P.S:

Now, I can move anywhere within 30 minutes. I‚Äôve learned new skills, enjoy my Nintendo, rehabilitated a tendon injury with resistance bands, and play LEGO with my son.

The war hasn‚Äôt gone away‚ÄîI‚Äôve just adapted. I analyze the situation daily to decide whether it‚Äôs time to ‚Äúrun‚Äù or stay, but also find minutes to enjoy life.¬†  
Minimalism lets you enjoy hobbies, sports, and a streamlined lifestyle with just what fits in your luggage.¬†

Being a minimalist also helps you stay calm, reducing distractions and allowing you to focus on what truly matters.¬†

  
Stoics encourage us to actively cultivate gratitude for that which we already have. They recommend making a concerted effort to imagine what it would be like if something you currently have was no longer there.¬†  
**How much would we miss it?**

The idea that you are not your stuff or must separate yourself for it is honestly stupid and harmful.,"**Title edit** ""The idea that you are not your stuff or must separate yourself **from** it is honestly stupid and harmful.""

You can be minimalist and love your items

You can be minimalist and love interior design / design in general

You can be minimalist and replace an item if you no longer like that colour/style

You can be minimalist and enjoy fashion & make up

You can be minimalist and love historical and cultural items

You can be minimalist and want a style change up because what you have no longer makes you happy

You can be minimalist and not be happy with what you have but know that some day your sacrifice of not having what you want immediately will allow you to one day have the money create a space you will love!

**Minimalism isn't about sacrificing your happiness in order to always have less, it is about having less of what you don't need so you have more room for what you love in your life!!!**

A personal example of this is because I didn't spend ¬£50 on a pair of crocs that I didn't need, I was able to replace my old skirts with nicer ones that I love wearing, were my old skirts still in good condition, yes and that's why I donated them but they did not make me happy or make me feel good when wearing them so I am not going to force myself to keep something and use it if it upsets me in the name sake of ""minimalism"" I am still minimalist because I still have exactly what I need and no more, one in one out rule ftw!

On another more serious note, people demonising the idea of having an identity in your belongings and blaming consumerism is just wrong, as u/choloepushofmanni pointed out ""Humans have been decorating our bodies to reflect our inner selves since long before marketing or capitalism existed.""

Both historically and culturally we have used material goods to showcase our innermost being, sharing stories and heritage through them, to deny this and in turn telling others to remove themselves from this way of thinking in honestly incredibly sad and harmful to cultural practices. I own a few cultural garments and jewellery from my heritage but I have made sure to keep it minimalist by only keeping what I wear and use daily or for special occasions. I have been told I am not minimalist because I own these things, that I should only have 8 black t-shits, 8 denim trousers and one pair of white trainers, like a ""real minimalist"".

Let people be people and enjoy their things, you can still be minimalist as long as you are conscious of the amount you own. We are all different and our needs differ too, please remember that something you wouldn't keep is something another could never let go.

"Dilemma: Have been practicing minimalism, my old stuff doesn't reflect my current personality","I have been practicing minimalism and mindfulness in my consumption since an year now now. I regularly declutter and over the months I've realised that I've started living simply and a lot of the stuff (even clothes) that I owned previously do not resonate with me anymore. 

I wonder what can we do in such a situation? I've grown into a much different person and the clothes or stuff I own don't reflect my personality anymore. (I haven't bought much last year, most of the stuff I own has been bought previously). I'm also doing a 'less buy year'. Does it make sense to go and purchase few items which just feel more like me now? Does it contradict the meaning of minimalism? 

Update: I received a mix of opinions, here's my take- a lot of the stuff I owned previously doesn't adapt to my lifestyle now. I was a student back then and now I'm a working professional. I believe it's alright to buy a few good quality pieces that take care of my needs, not wants. However, I'd make sure I make those purchases mindfully, I will buy what I really need, not what I am being sold. ",minimalism,1739682686.0

It seems a couple people have mentioned liking takaokaya and futonbedsfromjapan. I was wondering if there were any main differences between these two. They seem similarly priced after shipping, futonbedsfromjapan looks slightly pricier. 

There‚Äôs a the futon shop store close to where I live and tested the wool and latex shikifuton, it felt nice and it‚Äôs on sale rn but i saw some mixed opinions about the futon shop so was unsure.

I followed the urge to throw away /downsize 90% of my stuff,"I‚Äôve been a minimalist for about 8-9 years now but something changed in my brain last year that made me want to just get rid of everything. And strive to become more of an ultra minimalist. 

7 mos ago I started aggressively using up the products I have, regifting, donating, selling what could be sold. Now I mostly own one of each thing. Except clothes I have about 50 items.

As a result, my place is so neat and clean. Weekly cleaning and tidying up went from 2-3 hrs to just 5 mns a day. Under an hour per week. I have much more free time now to sleep or spend with family 

I do realize though that this may be a response to past traumas. But it became so easy to just let go of everything. And it feels like true freedom not being influenced to buy. I have not brought anything new into my house except some cleaning supplies and food the past 7ish months.

And it became all part of the interior or sort of. I've also produced a lot of waste in the process.

# Introduction

A few years ago, I shared a post with the same title in Douban Minimalist Living Group ([https://www.douban.com/group/minimalists/?ref=sidebar](https://www.douban.com/group/minimalists/?ref=sidebar)), which received mixed reactions. So I want to be upfront: my approach to minimalism goes beyond what most would consider ‚Äúsimple living‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit reaches what many people, even fellow minimalists in this group, might view as ‚Äúextreme.‚Äù

I‚Äôm sharing this to connect with others who understand, relate to, or aspire to this level of minimalist living‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthose who have a high tolerance for minimalism and embrace both minimalist philosophy and pragmatism. My journey has been deeply influenced by Japanese minimalist thought, including Zen philosophy and works like ‚ÄúDan Sha Ri‚Äù by Yamashita Eiko and ‚ÄúGoodbye, Things‚Äù by Sasaki Fumio. I‚Äôm happy to share my personal approaches to material, mental, digital, and dietary minimalism, and welcome any questions.

>‚ÄúDan Sha Ri‚Äù is a concept introduced by Yamashita Eiko, a Japanese decluttering consultant. The term became popular in Japan and was selected as one of the buzzwords of 2010.

>‚ÄúGoodbye, Things‚Äù is a book by Sasaki Fumio about minimalist living. It discusses the author‚Äôs journey towards a simpler lifestyle and provides tips for decluttering.

I‚Äôll chronicle my journey chronologically from 2018, showing the evolution of both my living spaces (Part 1) and personal appearance (Part 2). There are numerous photos throughout in [my Medium post](https://chanmeng666.medium.com/my-minimalist-journey-a-before-after-look-2018-2025-80198180ce16) ([https://chanmeng666.medium.com/my-minimalist-journey-a-before-after-look-2018-2025-80198180ce16](https://chanmeng666.medium.com/my-minimalist-journey-a-before-after-look-2018-2025-80198180ce16)).

# Part One: Evolution of Living¬†Spaces

# 2018: The Beginning¬†

This was my minimalist ‚ÄúYear Zero‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhen I first moved out of my family home to live independently. The rental came furnished with basic items: a bed, desk, closet, and water heater. At this point, I hadn‚Äôt encountered minimalism as a concept. Operating purely on my own understanding of an ‚Äúideal living space,‚Äù I accumulated numerous possessions.¬†

Two months into living alone, I discovered minimalism, which became a turning point in my life.

# 2019: The Year of Material Minimalism¬†

This was my most passionate year of pursuing material minimalism. While I‚Äôm not typically a reader, except for work-related materials, I would listen to audiobooks like ‚ÄúWalden; or, Life in the Woods‚Äù by Henry David Thoreau and ‚ÄúGoodbye, Things‚Äù by Sasaki Fumio while cleaning my apartment. These two books became my essential guides for developing a minimalist mindset.

# 2020: The Year of Mental Minimalism¬†

This year, spending extensive time at home led me to deepen my minimalist practice, advancing into what I call ‚Äúmental minimalism.‚Äù I eliminated many superficial social connections, deactivated most of my social media accounts (including Douban), and practiced emotional detachment from others‚Äô expectations and judgments.

Mid-2020, I relocated to a different city for work. The move was remarkably simple‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall my possessions fit into one backpack and one suitcase. On moving day, it took just two hours to pack, handle the landlord handover, and catch my high-speed train.¬†

While there was only one perfume bottle visible, I still owned various cosmetics, merely organized rather than minimized.

For a more radical minimalism experiment, I intentionally rented an unfurnished space‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit came with only air conditioning, a washing machine, and a water heater.

Initially, I bought a mattress for sleeping, but soon found it too heavy and difficult to manage. I switched to a bamboo platform bed, but during the rainy season, I discovered mold growing between the slats. Finally, I settled on a foam mat.

This became my permanent sleeping solution‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa simple foam mat on the floor, costing about ¬•80 (approximately $12 USD). The center would typically sag after six months, at which point I would cut the mat in half, rotate the pieces to put the unworn portions in the middle, and use it for another six months before replacing it.¬†

# 2021: The Year of ‚ÄúMinimalism Plus‚Äù¬†

This year, I developed a new concept: ‚ÄúMinimalism Plus‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääapplying minimalist principles to various aspects of life.

For example, through ‚ÄúMinimalism Plus Gender Narrative,‚Äù I successfully eliminated all cosmetics and gender-specific items that society typically associates with femininity. I freed myself from both physical and metaphorical ‚Äúcorsets.‚Äù

This concept expanded into other areas: ‚ÄúMinimalism Plus Digital Identity,‚Äù ‚ÄúMinimalism Plus Diet,‚Äù ‚ÄúMinimalism Plus Exercise,‚Äù ‚ÄúMinimalism Plus Creativity,‚Äù and more. I encourage others to create their own ‚ÄúMinimalism Plus‚Äù combinations.

Also this year, when the education training industry in China suddenly declined and my career prospects looked dim, I found peace in knowing I had no ‚Äúthree debts‚Äù (offspring, mortgage, marriage loans). Being debt-free and in complete control of my life resources (time/energy/attention/money) put me ahead of most people, so why worry?

# 2022: The Year of¬†Identity

This year, I minimized my old name, legally creating a new one. I chose not to follow either my father‚Äôs or mother‚Äôs surname, or any family name from either lineage, instead creating my own unique surname and given name.

This act of shedding an old identity and creating a new one felt more liberating than any username change in the digital world.

# 2023: The Year of International Transition

After two years of preparation (mentally, financially, and in terms of material minimalism), I left China in the first half of this year.¬†

Yes, you‚Äôre seeing correctly‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeverything I owned fit into one small backpack and one shopping bag.

The plastic bag contained: unused sanitary products, tissues, summer clothes, and slippers. The small backpack held: documents, electronic devices, and charging cables.

Everything else was given to a familiar recycling collector from my neighborhood.

Though it was a triple room, the personal storage space was more than abundant for my needs.

In the second half of 2023, I moved to another country for further study.

# 2024 ‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää 2025: The¬†Present¬†

Compared to my first international move, this time I brought a backpack plus a suitcase, mainly to accommodate winter clothing.¬†

# Part Two: Evolution of Personal Appearance

# 2017: Pre-Minimalism¬†

I spent considerable money on nail art and manicures.

# 2018: The Hair¬†Focus¬†

This was a year of significant spending on hair styling and treatments.¬†

# 2019: Beauty Standards Transition¬†

Although I had begun my journey into material minimalism‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven challenging myself to travel with just a backpack instead of a suitcase‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI was still heavily invested in following girl groups and beauty standards.

# 2020: Breaking Free from Constraints¬†

This year, I began experimenting with freedom from traditional clothing constraints. I started by replacing conventional bras with nipple covers, but found them uncomfortable and sweaty. I then switched to wearing fishing vests. My final solution became simple: in cold weather, just a coat; in warm weather, a lightweight fishing vest. This completely liberated my chest area‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou can see the vest style in the following photos.

Though I had drastically reduced my cosmetics collection, I still maintained the habit of wearing makeup for what I considered important social occasions.

# 2021: Minimalism Plus Gender Expression¬†

This became my foundation year for ‚ÄúMinimalism Plus Gender Narrative.‚Äù Starting January, I successfully eliminated all cosmetics and dresses from my life. Subsequently, concepts like ‚ÄúSix No‚Äôs and Four Liberations‚Äù and ‚ÄúThree Struggles and Three Oppositions‚Äù helped me shed even more intangible constraints.

# 2022: The Year of Self-Liberation¬†

This was truly a year of personal freedom. I seized every opportunity to explore the city, often walking for hours in comfortable sandals without carrying a bag, treating the entire city as my living room.

# 2023: The Bold¬†Change¬†

Before starting language school abroad, I shaved my head completely‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääan incredibly liberating experience.

**2024‚Äì2025: The Current¬†State**

I repeated the head-shaving experience before changing countries for further study. The photo shows the growth after several months. My current hair solution follows a six-month cycle based on my natural hair growth rate: shaved head ‚Üí buzz cut ‚Üí short hair ‚Üí shaved head, repeating the cycle.

This cyclical approach to hair maintenance exemplifies how minimalism can simplify even the most personal aspects of our lives while providing both practical benefits and personal satisfaction.

**Conclusion**

Through my journey to extreme minimalism, I‚Äôve discovered that true freedom often starts with letting go. As women, we‚Äôre constantly told we need countless products to be beautiful, numerous possessions to be successful, and specific behaviors to be acceptable. But I‚Äôve found the opposite to be true‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe less I carried, the lighter I felt; the fewer beauty standards I followed, the more authentic I became; the more social expectations I released, the more freely I could express myself. I encourage you to start your own journey of liberation‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit doesn‚Äôt have to look like mine, but I hope my story shows that it‚Äôs possible to break free from both material desires and social constraints to find your own path to freedom.

The biggest struggle is getting rid of the clothes shoes that are valuable and it feels to wasteful to donate them if they can be consigned.

Lots of toys and books which can be donated, although there are some that are totally new once again with tags on them and thinking about using Facebook to sell those items.

Anyone considered minimalism in the form of decluttering the mind too? Cutting out people etc?,"I've been thinking about minimalism. I started to think about how before I reached the point of wanting to clear my environment, I started with my mind. I did a lot of deep work. As I changed, so did my relationships with others. I started to set boundaries to keep my peace, to stop people draining me. These people kept pushing against my boundaries. My reasserting them repeatedly became exhausting in the end. I had no choice but to clear a lot of people from my life after that. Just to give my mind some space. I'm now at the point where I don't even turn my phone on and have deleted all the messaging apps. I also deactivated all social media and took my business website offline and decided to close my business. I'm totally done with everything. 

Anyone else done this with people? Did it help you long term? I just want some peace. Minimalism feels like so much more than just clearing the physical space. It's all that mental clutter too that takes up a lot of room.

How to stop buying impulsively?,"Hello everybody! Since I've been in the world of minimalism for almost a year now, I've been trying to have as few things as possible. Could this be minimalism?

Anyway, that's not the point of the post. I'm a girl who really likes fashion and clothes. I'm in a cycle of taking clothes that I don't wear/that don't suit my style anymore to a thrift store, and I make money doing it. When I go out to a shopping mall, I see an outfit and the first few times, I bought it impulsively when I imagined where I would wear that piece. After a few days, the feeling of having too many things came to me and I went through my wardrobe again, and I didn't like that piece anymore, taking it to the thrift store again and selling it for a lower price than I paid. It's been this cycle ever since. üîÅ 

After I realized this, I've been thinking better about what I want to buy when I go out. I have a wish list that are a higher value, then I lose interest in buying at that moment, but I would still like to have one one day. It's not something urgent, you know?

I recently returned from a trip and I have this strong thought that I want to save money and not spend it on frivolous things. I want to make this happen, but it's difficult. I don't want to stay in this cycle again, as I end up at a loss.

I know this is anxiety, and it is already in the plans for future treatment. I would like tips on how not to spend and not have that feeling of wanting that thing at that moment.

I‚Äôm new to minimalism. Seeking to hear your wisdom and experience.,"
I have so much stuff! So many toiletries! So many things that are expiring for not being used. I‚Äôve become a massive hoarder and I‚Äôm drowning in things. 

I‚Äôve been thinking of a few ways to move into a minimalistic lifestyle that I can work on such as: 

1. Use up all the toiletries I have before I ever consider buying any more.
2. Use up all food stores in my garage. 
3. Sell off my things that I no longer need. 
4. Start wearing my excess footwear or sell it. 

Other things I‚Äôm already doing:

1. Deleted all my social media
2. Turning off my phone during the day and at night. Leaving only a small window for distractions. 
3. Avoiding all news, politics and opinions. 

I genuinely enjoy the act of frugality as I grew up in poverty. It‚Äôs exciting to make something from nothing and to repair what i have. It gives me a great sense of achievement. I‚Äôm also stuck in this cycle of novelty seeking. Hence all the toiletries, foods and books. I crave peace and simplicity.

"Floor Mattresses, please help.","Hello everyone

I‚Äôm starting to seriously consider transitioning to a Japanese futon/floor mattress, as I had an ex who slept on one and I actually found it quite beneficial for my mental health.

In researching different options I‚Äôve discovered that the bulk of reviews related to floor mattresses are written by people who have no intention of sleeping on them regularly, making the task of finding relevant information/product recommendations quite difficult. 

Consequently, I have a few questions that I‚Äôm hoping can be answered by some of you lovely folk:

1. How much should I be looking to spend for a high quality firm mattress? 
No frills, no fancy covers or fabrics, just a simple and durable option for someone who wants to experience the benefits of floor sleeping.

2. What materials typically denote a quality/authentic product? 
I‚Äôve seen wool, memory foam, nylon, cotton, etc. And without fail every one of these options are described as being ‚Äúbest in class‚Äù or ‚Äútraditional‚Äù. Please help.

3. Could I please have some good brand recommendations?

Consumerism is exploitive and the amount of ads is insane.,"I was talking to an acquaintance about Disney World because he had taken his kids and was talking about how expensive it was and how it reminded him of Egypt, with everyone trying to sell you something and constantly being in your face.

He described the trip as exhausting because there were all these little surprise expenses,and he just felt manipulated and maneuvered the whole trip.

I had gone as an adult because of childhood nostalgia and had the same experience.

His comment about Egypt though made me think about how I already feel that way in normal everyday life.

I remember talking to a friend as a young adult about how I secretly thought that credit card companies were to blame for toxic work environments, because people in debt cannot easily quit jobs.

Regular Mattress vs Thick Cotton Futon (Shikibuton)?,"Has anyone here slept on both mattress types for an extended period (at least months, ideally years)? How was your sleep quality and efficiency? Additional points if you measured your sleep scores before and after with Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, or another sleep tracker.

I'm considering upgrading from a cheap memory foam mattress (Zinus) to a latex mattress (Nolah Natural and Eco Organic Mattress are the main contenders at the moment).

But an intriguing alternative seems to be a 100% cotton futon. Why this seems appealing: no chemicals/off-gassing, and cotton is also good for people who sleep hot. They are also cheaper.

I'm not sure if I'll be able to handle the firmer surface though, so I'm curious about everyone's experience. And I'm sure I'm missing some other important context/drawbacks.

My Stuff is Distracting Me - How to Become More Minimal?,"Hi,

I been lurking in this sub for quite a while. I did my first konmari several years ago when I was in highschool- there was a couch sized mountain of clothes. Over the years I've been continuing to declutter especially since I moved into a 400 sqft + shed place a couple of years ago. My house is very livable and organized (sometimes I do put off the dishes but keeping all the guest dishes in a separate place has helped them piling up). I still have a lot of stuff, though, and it weighs on me especially when I'm stressed. 

I have adhd and bipolar and am in my last semester of college. I really think it could help with my stress and distraction. I'm always thinking about my stuff throughout the day (it feels like I haven't ever really finished decluttering or really ""committed"") and I wish I could get to the point where I just know why I have something and that it's there intentionally. I have a lot of guilt and anxiety since I have decluttered stuff I regret before, even though I don't regret decluttering overall. I think I'm going to try a purgatory bin in the shed again. My shed is full of furniture (ugh one of the things I'm a sucker for and some of it is sentimental) and it's supposed to be for my bike, garden stuff, outdoor gear. I want to feel prepared for life and like I can focus and do the things I really want to be doing. 

I'm really just wondering if y'all have any advice for someone who has a lot of anxiety about making these decisions and how to move forward. I'm not at a place where getting rid of all my crap is super urgent but it does bother me on a daily basis. (Which kind of does feel urgent but I don't want to create a new problem) I'm not worried about being the Best Minimalist Ever but I just feel like it's not quite clicking yet and there are a lot of ""maybe"" items floating around.

I'm also very anxious to have too much stuff or just keep it all because I can tell it's affecting me negatively. One of my grandmas was also a hoarder and we had to clean out her trailer. It was pretty \*enlightening\*

I would really appreciate any advise y'all have especially if you have a lot of hobbies or experience with how it interacts with mental health. Thanks

Office Supplies,"Hey guys, so recently over the last few months I have been trying to edit and declutter our home.

With that being said, getting to the office and art supplies have been a little difficult to me. I know we have double of everything and sometimes triple because we both got the same art kits while being in college.

But I'm stumped on a few things. How much is too much art supplies or whats a good amount to keep? I would love our future kids to be able to use our art supplies too for those expensive colored pencils, pastels, and markers we have but basically office supplies I'm trying to figure out what a base number would be.

How many highlighters should we keep?
Paper clips?
Binder clips?
Rubberbainds?
Binder supplies?
Water colors?
Paint brushes?
Notebooks?
Sketch pads?

I have an interest in Bullet Journaling too so I know I have quite a few things for that, but I know we have over flow we can donate or get rid of. I'm just not sure what a good amount to keep as a base to shoot for is.

Minimalism and my fixation on upgrades/efficiency,"I‚Äôve got one for you all ‚Äî how many of you consider yourselves a minimalist, but wrap that inside a cocoon of efficiency, system, and therefore‚Ä¶ an inevitable upgrade/swapping lifestyle?

I‚Äôve always been a fairy streamlined person. When I was younger and broke, I was extremely frugal. As my career took off, I‚Äôve always been mindful of my spend/accumulation and want to live well below my means. I try to keep my ‚Äústuff‚Äù to a minimum ‚Äî essentials and hobbies. I‚Äôm really good about selling old things I no longer use, avoiding clutter, etc. However, I‚Äôve noticed that my minimalistic lifestyle lends itself to create a bit of an upgrade culture. I will discover something that is an improvement on my current setup, and I make the upgrade and sell/downsize whatever it replaced. On paper, it‚Äôs a good system. But I find that I struggle more and more to appreciate what I have, the systems I‚Äôve created (which work just fine), and ignore my urges to ‚Äúoptimize everything.‚Äù 

Examples from 2024:
1. Had a small sling (3l) ‚Äî worked perfectly for my daily needs, but really didn‚Äôt love how it carried when I rode my bike (often). I upgraded to a 6l sling from Chrome that carries much better on the bike. My old sling worked for 90% of my life, but I felt that I needed that extra 10%. 3l sling was sold.

2. Replaced most of the stock parts on my hardtail mountain bike. Were those stock parts perfectly fine and capable? Yes, but I felt like I wanted to curate my bike for specific trips/styles of riding, and the upgrades would get me there. Sold old parts to a local bike shop.

3. Had a leatherman skeletool ‚Äî worked well, no complaints on function. But then found a model that had a better set of pliers that were much more usable for bike repairs, so they could double as a multitool in both my backpacking/hiking packs and my bike kit. Upgraded to that model and sold the Skeletool.

I guess my point is this ‚Äî am I alone in feeling that maybe I‚Äôm fixating too much on maximum efficiency/upgrading to exactly what I need for every situation? I wish I was better at buying the best thing first try, but I feel like I‚Äôm in the ‚Äúbuy, use for awhile, see what works/doesn‚Äôt, seek more optimized version‚Äù phase.",minimalism,1738907407.0
The Minimalist Paradox: Marketing Minimalism,"The Minimalist Paradox: Marketing Minimalism

**The Minimalist: Less is Now** Documentary on Netflix sure was an interesting case study on how to sell simplicity as a product. I wasn‚Äôt a fan‚Äîit was supposed to be relaxing background noise while I worked, but instead, it pulled me in for all the wrong reasons... and let me tell you why.

Federal Reserve data indicates that the top 10% of wealth holders control 70.4% of total wealth (assets, equities, private business). Meanwhile the bottom 50% are more likely to own low investment assets like cars, or a rental house full of treasures, which snowballs inequity over time. The bottom 50% owns \~3.7% of wealth, so what exactly is the incentive for individual entrepreneurism, saving, or not treating yourself? It makes sense we are all self-soothing- the planet is dying, the cost of living rigged against us, and public spaces are consistently reducing their amenity, so content and consuming really is our only community. ¬†

I felt uncomfortable watching this, and angry at times that a lot of minimalism content feels like a trendy aesthetic rather than a response to limited resources. The ‚Äòguru‚Äôs' are these corporate guys, who have money, and are pivoting to selling an idea and their story rather than a product as this profound life hack.

It's frustrating, because there is value in reducing our consumption through intentional living, but the documentary doesn‚Äôt really touch on how to do that, it's more of a gateway to them as a product- which is why it feels inauthentic, like‚Ä¶ *who is this really for?*

The content was incredibly performative, he narrates this re-enactment of himself, unboxing his childhood- but only physically- not really ever making the connection that unpacking physical clutter is not a replacement for unpacking the emotional clutter of grief. Ironically, it feels like the whole topic is talked about in a way that is adjacent to his pain, where we the audience are criticised for consuming for the same reasons- because we are trying to buy the person we want to be or to fill an emotional void. I‚Äôve lost both my parents ‚Äì one of whom was a hoarder- so don't come for me, it's probably the reason why I felt so physically uncomfortable watching it. It's not a vulnerable way to contemplate mortality, or trying to help anyone, or latent with any salient strategies. It is a product too. 

Minimalism is a valuable conversation about conscious consumption. The more stuff you own, the more your stuff owns you. Stuff can creep up around you over time, and those objects become attachments with their own stories and memories. My top tips for minimalism so you don‚Äôt have to subscribe are ...

Top Tips

1. **SYSTEMS ARE EVERYTHING!** ‚Äì Clear storage solutions with labels (e.g., ""Christmas decorations""). Keep like items together‚Äîpencils stay with their pencil friends. If you have to move three things to get to one, your system isn‚Äôt working. My personal favs are Bunnings modular storage, the Flexi Mesh baskets (towels/linin), Montgomery stackable draws are so good for stationary or teachers - cheap and sturdy.
2. **Start with non-sentimental things** ‚Äì Kitchens/Linin cupboards are a great place to begin. Take everything out, clean, and set a goal like getting rid of at least one bag of unnecessary items or only have one set. Take it all out into a pile Kondo Style.
3. **Get the hoarder out of the house** ‚Äì If someone is resistant, give them their own space to control and create momentum elsewhere. Grouping items for them in advance can help, but personally, I don‚Äôt engage after that‚Äîit‚Äôs exhausting hearing every story about why something *must* be kept. Set clear limits, e.g., You have three full boxes, but only one empty box for keeping items. ¬†Done. Get out of there immediately. 
4. **Regular declutter challenges** ‚Äì Make it a habit instead of a one-time thing. I had a little bench top where I could go through everything while watching TV.
5. **Big goes First, and Small goes last** ‚Äì Once everything has a designated place, deal with the tiny bits. I used my garage to pile up the large junk and hired a van to do tip runs which freed up a lot of space and is the cheapest option. 
6. **One thing in, two things out rule**
7. **Prioritise experiences over stuff** ‚Äì Set ""no-buy"" challenges and reward yourself with experiences instead. Train your brain to get the dopamine hit elsewhere.
8. **If you don‚Äôt clear it out, you‚Äôll just keep cleaning it up** ‚Äì Reducing clutter reduces mental clutter‚Äîso no more rage-quitting over a stuck potato masher in the cutlery draw. 
9. **Cool-down periods on purchases** ‚Äì Shop sustainably and set limits, like I get to pick Maximum one item at a local market. Only keep things you truly treasure‚Äîdon‚Äôt hoard out of gift guilt. 
10.  **Sister Swap Boutique**\- me and my sisters regularly do a big clothes swap. Its actually so fun and I love it. We all get our clothes together in a massive pile and do fashion show then take the rest to Vinney‚Äôs that isn‚Äôt wanted.

Minimizing my whole house (again),"I go over my house about every six months, and always find areas to improve.

Any other tips?

How to Clean Out an Area:

1) Pick your area, as big or small as you like. 

2) Remove absolutely everything.

3) Clean area.

4) Pick out the things you love or need, and neatly put them away. 

5) Separate the left overs into trash bags. Use black bags for trash & white bags for donations. Use boxes for heavier things.

6) Get the bags & boxes out of your house as soon as possible. 

7) Enjoy your new neat, clean, simplified space!

Japanese Floor Mattress: Recommendations needed,"Hi everyone! My husband and I want to get rid of our double bed and get Japanese floor mattresses.

Balancing maximalism with minimalism,"I‚Äôve always considered myself to be a maximalist. I enjoy my little trinkets, and I feel comfortable when there is a lot going on. 

The issue is that I want to change my relationship with consumerism. I‚Äôve always been incredibly fascinated with minimalism. When I was young, I watched some documentary that mentioned 90/90 rule. Have I used it in the last 90 days / will I use it in the next 90 days? I think that‚Äôs a bit extreme for me, considering there are other things I enjoy keeping that just make me smile.

But I‚Äôm tired of just having‚Ä¶so much stuff. I want to live a life where I can still enjoy what makes me smile, but in a minimalist way, if that makes sense.

For example: I enjoy getting blind box figures. They make me happy. But I want to learn to get a single set and enjoy exactly each one and appreciate what I have. I am an artist so I am loaded with art supplies, but I know some things will never be used. But I‚Äôve always had issues getting rid of them because I know I ‚Äúmight‚Äù use them. Same with clothes.

I want to appreciate everything I have and feel like it isn‚Äôt me slowly just collecting and putting things everywhere. 

Is there a balance between? Maybe this is a dumb question, but I just want to start somewhere.",minimalism,1738872829.0

fears,"i think i'm afraid of doing minimalism wrong. others on social media seems to do minimalism ""right"". but before you start attacking me with the ""oh come on, there's no right way"" let me stop you--yes there is.   
otherwise why would you clean before you set up your cameras? why aren't we ALL sharing our glamorous living rooms? why are the influencers still the minority?   
  
because some of us all have this real fear. frugality.  
  
the influencers all get one set of interior that ""fits"" AND ""trending"" for every room that they show. some of us only have one room, period.   
they have different pairs of glasses that match their different sets of nails for every video and won't show us where they're stored. some of us only wear one pair of glasses. and gasp, no nails.   
they have clean everything but won't show us their cleaning products.   
when their channel soars after years, you're shocked to find that they have moved into a ""bigger"" house. (yes, really.)

Regain Yourself,"I think that we are metaphorically being attacked. It is our attention and wallets that are being attacked. When you listen to a podcast for hours what does YOUR mind think.

It seems these things are all distractions and the harsh reality is that life is difficult but will be more difficult the longer we go without paying attention to ourselves and continually drift away from knowing ourselves closely.

Aesthetic glass containers in the kitchen,"So, I have a dozen large, vintage / antique glass containers in my kitchen. I used to have more space (I lived in a small house, now an apartment) and I got creeped out about a possible pest infestation and bought all these awesome glass jars :D Because I also care about things looking nice :P   
I never had mice inside the house, but a friend had a mouse problem at her house, and they came in the kitchen too.  
Now I'm about to move again, and those containers are bulky and heavy. I can use up my pantry items but still have the containers to move. And this likely won't be my last move either. It just feels too cumbersome. 

Do you store your dry pantry items in the original packaging? Have you ever had insects? 

I'm kind of thinking that as long as I actually use up the stuff I have, insects shouldn't be a problem? And as I see my pantry items behind doors, why do they need to be in aesthetically pleasing containers?

Minimalist beginner,"Starting my minimalist journey, although I joke that it was always a part of me. 

I've been slowly decluttering clothes that I don't wear anymore. I joined a group online where you can basically put your stuff up and someone could pick it up for you. 

Everybody I have an attic full of stuff, And although it's not at a hoarder level, I looked recently and thought I could easily make this attic into a second bedroom if I got rid of some of these things in storage. There was even some clothes that I wore back in my twenties, and I'm halfway through my thirties now. 
Don't get me wrong. It's a flex to know that I could still fit in those clothes, but there's memories attached to them that I don't think are very happy. Ironically some of those clothes I thrifted so maybe I could give it a third life with someone else. 

I want to get to a point where I have a capsule wardrobe and look ageless, I want to make sure that most of my lounge clothes could also double as going out clothes if I so wanted to. 

In the meantime I'm saving every penny that I can, only time I spend is when I want to go out somewhere or to pay off some debt.

Women‚Äôs clothes,"Hi everyone,

After 2 kids my body shape, size and weight has changed so much that before firstborn, in between the 2, after 2nd and couple of years after 2nd feels like a whole new person.

Until last year I donated a lot of clothes, really good clothes. Primary reason being , I had no time communicating on fb marketplace. Some of the decisions were not so right. I had some really good office clothes (Oxford and different brands) which might have been useful.

Even after reducing , I still have a big collection in my opinion. I can fit all the clothes (irrespective of the reason) in the wardrobe which is currently being shared. But I still feel there is a possibility to reduce. Which can create space (right now it‚Äôs fully packed) and also easier to find options when getting ready.

What do you think is the ideal way on reducing without feeling guilty about what-ifs they become useful in the future, depending on different seasons and laundry and everything what should be min no of clothes (I go to office once a week)

Allergic reaction = forced declutter,"I had an allergic reaction to something and I have no idea what it could have been from. I had hives all over my face and hands so I assume it was something in my skincare routine. (I‚Äôve been tested for food allergies and nothing came back). Only issue, nothing I use has been changed in months. I‚Äôm a creature of habit and if I like something i continue to use it and then rebuy it when it‚Äôs out.

My dermatologist confirmed it was an allergic reaction and I have a prescribed routine to help the rash and block all the histamines. Luckily that is working wonderfully because I was about to scratch my face off.

She suggested, though she is not an allergist, that I stop using anything that touches my skin and slowly reintroduce things one by one. 

So I started with body wash and deodorant. Those are hygiene my non-negotiables. Luckily those didn‚Äôt irritate my skin. But as soon as I was ready to get to my skincare (moisturizers, serums, etc), I freaked out. I don‚Äôt trust any of it anymore.

Decluttering Storage Unit,"Hey there,

Brief history: Lived in a house for 10 years, father passed away unexpectedly, mother moved in with my sibling in another state and I decided to live abroad with my husband and our animals for 2 years. In the span of 6 months I both removed all the unnecessary items unrelated to our new life from my own home and took in family heirlooms and memorabilia from my deceased parent and the other who was downsizing.

We packed ourselves into 4 checked luggage, 2 carryons and 2 personal items (read: our dog and cat), everything else was placed into a 10'x10' storage unit near the in-laws.

It's been 2 years and we've moved back to a different state and have collected all of the storage unit items and everything we own into our new rental. I'm severely overwhelmed with boxes upon boxes of memorabilia from my childhood, my deceased family members (my dad had a lot of his parents things), and more.

Can someone please explain or provide guidance as to how one's supposed to move through these items and get control back of their things? We have shoved most of the memorabilia and heirlooms into a room dubbed ""the room of requirement"" and I'm not sure where to start. Without divulging too much, we have quite a lot of family history we need to preserve for legal reasons, so I'm just not sure how to proceed.

What would you do with old diaries?,"My husband and I are moving places in some weeks, so I started a big declutterring session that took some months.

At some point I found that I have some ""decluttering fatigue"" and feel like my decisions aren't that clear and concise anymore. 

In this state, I stumbled over my teenage and young-adult diaries. I kept them because I felt I had to keep them and I always think of my mother who said ""Don't get rid if your diaries, they will be important to you some day!"" - But will they?

I started to read in these diaries and found myself reminded of all the bad times (I mean, probably pretty average teenage stuff, heartaches etc.) and felt the long way I was coming from. But reading this stuff and seeing what I was and what I am now also flipped my entire day feelings upside down, and I did not feel too good and overwhelmed by all this ""time travelling"" and some ""what if's"" etc. I also saw how much I already had forgotten and I felt a sense of finding my old identity or identities, which, on the other hand was also interesting and helpful. As if it could help to stay young to remember the younger me... I don't know, it's hard to explain.

So, long story short: what would you do or what did you do with your diaries? Is it useful to hold on to old identities? Or is it just emotional clutter? Is it important to not forget? Or is the only thing that counts today and tomorrow? What would you do in my situation? Thank you for your time üòä",minimalism,1738271493.0
Almost losing everything made me realize how I should keep letting go.,"This is more of a vent. A few days ago we had an unexpected leak in my apartment, in a matter of hours all of the wooden floors, walls and baseboards were full of water. We have to evacuate so they can dry and then renovation will start, they are planning to take around 1-3 months, and we'll have to stay somewhere else. I had to pack my essentials and leave, I'm gladly staying at my boyfriend's which is saving my life and making it so much easier.

I saw everything I own laying around, things that I haven't thought about for many years, clothes that don't fit, old bedding, all sorts of stuff that was just a burden, things that I had to think ""what should I do with this? where should I store this?"", and then I realized I don't need them, I need my essentials. I'm currently living out of a backpack and a tote bag while waiting to get more of my stuff. I put up a lot of stuff for sale online, trying to get rid of these problems. 

In the same week, I, who have been living in my country for seven full years, almost risked going back to my home country because of immigration issues (thankfully not in the US, but still affected). I almost lost my job, my country, my relationships in this place, my education, I lost my house for at least the next month or how long it actually takes. I have never been in this amount of stress in my life. And now I realized, holding on to things, material or not, will just make me suffer. I suffered for the loss of the routine I had at my place, the loss of being in my apartment, the pre-anticipated loss of everything else that I haven't lost. Now, I am letting go and I will continue to detach, detaching myself from things I was holding on to so tightly that the mere thought of losing them (material things, objects, routines, lifestyles) was causing me severe anxiety.

I now have much less stuff than I used to, I realized what is truly important for me, and what minimalism truly is; letting go of what holds you back, physically and mentally. 

EDIT: Thank you so much for the nice words and kindness. Our landlord has asked us to leave as the renovation will take at least 4 months, we are looking for smaller places. I‚Äôve put up lots of stuff for sale online and made some donations as well. 
Due to immigration issues, I‚Äôll stay 5 weeks to 3 months without work, this has made me put my whole life into perspective. I‚Äôll have a period of rest to take care of myself better and focus on new things such as my hobbies, learning, exercising.

Minimalism in Pregnancy/Postpartum Wardrobe,"Anyone else have this problem? My husband and I are such minimalists. Even with having toddlers we have managed to to keep a minimal household. My wardrobe was exactly how I liked it...until I got pregnant. Obviously my body changed and I couldn't keep up! Now I'm postpartum for the third time and all my clothes fit differently. My whole wardrobe is overfilled with stuff that may(?) fit me one day. Some is too big some too small. Just all the wrong sizes. And, like, I don't want to buy a pair of pants that will (hopefully lol) be too big in a few months as I start losing a bit of weight! 

Also, side note, on top of this my family has been unhelpful. My mother is very critical of the fact I have been dressing for comfort over fashion in my pregnancy and postpartum (I do tend to look like Adam Sandler these days). She and my other family members keep giving me ""gifts"" of clothes that are (1) not my style and (2) are wayyyy too small for ""when I lose all that baby weight."" 

Now my closet is overstuffed with random stuff and none of it really fits right now or is even my style.

Anyone ever been through this and can give advice?",minimalism,1738270748.0
Opposite of the usual problem,"My husband and I are a little unusual in the minimalist category. 

We downsized enormously over the last decade or so, moving from a stuffed 3 bedroom house to eventually a 600 sq ft apartment, moving 1400 miles in the process so we could live in the Sunbelt. 

But we always wanted to travel long term and decided to go for it last year. So we sold or donated nearly everything we owned and took off last spring to travel around Europe. 

We enjoyed ourselves immensely, but we ran into some roadblocks to doing that long-term. Mostly, the roadblocks were about our preferences, not our needs, but they led to us deciding that traveling was still important to us, but we'd prefer to do it for shorter periods of time and from a fixed home base. 

So after 8 months on the road, we decided to move back to our original city in the north. We arrived on January 1 with one suitcase and one backpack each, containing everything we owned in this world. 

We had to find an apartment, get a car, furnish the apartment with literally everything we would need, set up new insurance, driver's license, voter registration, library cards, everything you need to live in a place. In the middle of winter up north. While we both managed to catch a couple of the viruses going around.

It's been interesting, leading to good discussions on what we actually need vs want, what we can afford all at once, what's better to buy new vs. thrifted. 

Our apartment currently has much, much less in it than any apartment we've ever lived in before. We own far fewer clothes than we've ever owned except while long-term traveling. And yet, mostly this is enough. It's been a real revelation. 

So now, instead of the extreme minimalists that we were while traveling, we are now... essentialists, maybe? And we live in an apartment that is mostly bare, with closets and cupboards that are mostly empty. I think most people we know would feel sorry for us having so little, and yet we look around and see so much more than we owned just a month ago. It's disconcerting. And yet we still feel more free than we felt before our travels. 

I'm not looking for accolades. More interested in knowing if anyone else has been in a similar situation and might have observations about the future and how things might go from here. 

For the record, we're both over 65 and retired. ",minimalism,1738257625.0
Hoarders in this community,"I have had several negative and rash experiences with sensitive, stubborn hoarders who refuse to accept it and start emotionally decluttering and throwing things out.  I understand it is a difficult process, but please remain civil and remember you are talking to human beings.  I know to get yelled is a common thing because you are  are still obsessed with your 600 dvd collection because its in 4k quality is but then complaining you have no space because you are surrounded by useless things while yelling at us is not fair.  In some cases they have basic items sitting in your house for decade or more and you still don't want to let it go, then it's okay just accept you are a hoarder and move on from there, please be cognizant of why you have chosen to post to r/minimalism.

If you don't want the members help, you can read or listen to works like Marie Kondo or other basic ideas as throwing things out if you haven't used.  A lot of people in this community are just trying to help and we receive a lot of ridicule and unproductive hateful comments because some people cannot address their problems without a flood of defensive emotions.

But, we have no skin in this game other than to promote a healthy living lifestyle mentally, physically, and spiritually, based on reducing to just the things we need and maximizing light, cleaningliness, and space.

Therefore, if you post here that you have an epiphany several times and want us to help you solve hoarding behaviors but can only respond by lashing out in continous condescending manners or berating minimalistic ideas, please understand that we are human beings and we can only have so much patience.  Understand we are just trying to help, and not everything is a personal attack.  (i.e. if I say it's collecting dust, it is not a personal but literal fact)

Again, there is nothing in this for us who are trying to help you.  If you cannot accept this, than please come back later when you have a better epiphany or post in a different r/ because this is not a platform to dump hatred to others.  Thank you.

In an odd situation and need a bit of guidance,"So my situation/life isn't typical. I haven't bought a ton of unnecessary stuff, instead I've inherited a lot. Historical items, antiques, pieces of family history, a silk scarf from 1790 (I'm thinking of having this one framed), handmade birchroot baskets from the indigenous line of my family, medieval chests, a freaking pearl crown, a sofa that was a gift from a long-dead monarch, corsets and tiny little adult suits for tiny boys (hand stitched!), actual snakeskin heels (I'm going to wear these bcs they're in my size), a wolf fur coat, a freaking mangle made of solid iron and marble, books from the 1690's-early1900ds, reindeer-bone knives, a carriage and two sleds, two heavy iron sewing machines, a SWORD, bottles of ""inkblack""(???), a freaking bull horn set in some kind of silver thing to make it stand upright (I think it's for drinking), beds that have doors on them like cabinets, wooden skis, an ENDLESS supply of copper cookware with little iron feet (they're in bad shape but could maybe be cleaned up), oh yeah a freaking HUGE loom, reams and reams of maps of the area from the late 1800ds through ww2, loose wood-framed windows full of bubbles (likely handmade), endless hand-embroidered sheets, ornate iron lamps, 2 HUGE tupperwares full of handwritten documents some of which have wax seals...

...what the fuck do I do? This isn't the sort of stuff you give to a Goodwill-like charity and I don't have the knowhow to care of things that belong in a museum. And is there any museum that would even want them? Most of them are at my family's old place and I just feel overwhelmed. I don't think I can take care of all this by myself, but I also feel bad getting rid of a lot of it. It seems wrong to drive it to the dump. It seems wrong to sell it. It's not stuff people who want donations would take. Getting rid of a lot of it would make me feel guilty too, like I'm betraying the family history somehow? Please give me some advice, I'm not a minimalist as such but I'm not sure where else I should ask for advice on this kind of thing.

Minimalist parents: weigh in on Yoto Player please,"We try to focus on open-ended, quality toys (and repurposing household items). Daughter is turning 3 soon and I'm considering a Yoto player. If any parents with a more minimalist perspective have one, I'd love to get your thoughts.

I try to be very intentional about the things we bring into our home. I hesitate to get into a system where we have to keep buying expensive cards to get value out of it. I guess you can make your own cards but it kind of seems complicated.I keep hearing people rave about these to the point where I feel like maybe everyone's just falling for marketing hype? Is this solving a problem I don't actually have? Is this the Instapot for toddlers? (Instapot lovers, don't come for me lol)

Pros are that Daughter loves music. We steer clear of most electronics but she does have a toy ""radio"" with 50 pre-loaded songs (Leapfrog Let's Record Radio) that has consistently been a favorite toy for well over a year. Yoto would give her independent access to way more songs and also stories without giving her something with a screen. I also like that the cards would be something grandparents could get her for Christmas/birthday gifts, possibly for years, instead of stuff she doesn't want/need.

I often find myself with an itch to get a new shiny thing, and it doesn‚Äôt help that a lot of my hobbies are ‚Äúthing‚Äù based like Magic the Gathering, games, etc. I feel like I‚Äôve trained myself to get those dopamine hits when I hear the delivery truck stop by and even though I do my best to stop buying, I still get that itch every now and then and doesn‚Äôt feel like it goes until a new shiny arrives. The feeling resets until it‚Äôs back a month later. 
I have tried some methods such as keeping a want/need list, adding the item to cart and thinking of pros and cons of it, etc, but they don‚Äôt seem to work as I still find myself with the feeling.
So, to conclude: any suggestions deeper than ‚Äújust don‚Äôt buy‚Äù, targeting the feeling rather than the action?

Update: Thanks to everyone for the replies! It was a lot of feedback and I want to take it small steps at a time and picked the ones that I think will work for me.

A small note: although a lot of the replies are great ways to NOT buy, I don‚Äôt often. My main issue I wanted to tackle was the feeling that I need more stuff.

MINIMALISM JOURNEY,"WARNING: DO NOT THROW EVERYTHING AWAY BECAUSE IT CAN BE A SIGN OF DEPRESSION & VALUING WHAT YOU HAVE IS IMPORTANT...

Step 1: I got KICKED OUT of my parents house during the pandemic (negative view point). Another POV is they got me my own living space and room and board in a shared house. :D Where I matured and ""let go of the umbilical chord"". I was 15 minutes away and my friends were negative (made me feel kicked out) OR they wanted to crash and take advantage. SOME FRIENDS. I was 15 minutes away by car and anything I really needed they could drop off (outside of a blizzard or medical emergency or vacation). And amazon could deliver (outside of a blizzard). I had funds, etc. And I had only a few bags and boxes and hadn't fully moved out.

Step 2: Left the country. I left every one behind with just two suitcases. No friends. No family. No dog. No stuff. For 2 years. To help me re-evaluate my life choices, my friends, my family ( I went to their country). And to get perspective about USA politics (I'm American).

Step 3: Came back but to a different state. Went from NYC to Virginia. So, so nice to me. America really is huge. And while there's no place like NYC - that means the rest of the US is different too... I'm still in Step 3. But so far- the dynamic changed a bit. My friends still made space for me, but I'm ready to let go and grow up. My parents made space for me, but I am balancing being their kid and being independent. It's tough. But now I have a backbone, I guess!

And the toxic friends are gone.

Edit:  
Physical Stuff: My parents are finally renovating the basement as an apartment for me to have the best of both worlds and save some money.  
Mental Stuff: I have a laptop I enjoy to do online classes for a year (bootcamp)  
Emotional Stuff: I have a diary that I like  
Social Stuff: I have a new best friend who is of my background and \*gets it\*.

What are some versatile items?,"Been into minimalism for 7 years. This is my first time engaging with the community. I was wondering how I can further cut down on what I own while still being able to have multiple hobbies. I thought of this because I recently got back into calisthenics and got a french press and realized how versatile rings are for calisthenic workouts and that a french press can do cold brew, coffee and Tea. I was also wondering for what solution I can do for my Pc in the future. I enjoy gaming and being able to customize it but if I were to get a laptop I wouldn't be able to customize it and it would cost more to reach the performance I have on my current Pc.

Enjoying my minimalist wardrobe,"I‚Äôve been enjoying the freeing feeling of my minimalist wardrobe. 43M. Decided back in the beginning of September to do an experiment around my house to only wear the same 5 T-shirts for the next 90 days. My wife is very observant and thought she would eventually notice. Finished the 90 days and more into December until it got too cold and then let my family in on my experiment. They never noticed, never cared lol and I am assuming no one else outside of my family did (or cared). 

All this to say that it has been freeing to only have 5 T-shirts to choose from and then in the winter I have a few Henleys and a few hoodies. I have saved a bunch of money and time choosing each day what to wear. Highly recommend the 90 day experiment if you have ever thought about doing something similar. ",minimalism,1738014333.0

[LF Advice] Redundant Tech,"I wrote a wall of text and deleted it, in favor of this summary. I have 3 devices: a gaming laptop, steam deck, and a gaming desktop. I love my laptop (Framework 16) and Steam Deck. I like all my tech to have a specific role in my tech-family, but there is now duplication of roles across these devices which has lead to me experiencing some choice paralysis, and thus stress, over feeling like some of these devices own me more than I own them in that they should be used/needed more often than they are.

Roles:  
Desktop: Gaming.

Laptop: Gaming, travel, work.

Steam Deck: Gaming, ultra-travel.

By this logic I could get rid of my desktop (which isn't worth nearly what I paid anymore) and my Steam Deck (which I adore) and still have every role fulfilled. Technically the Steam Deck is a more comfortable travel companion than the laptop for gaming, but I don't actually travel that often. This has lead to an inner conflict between my desire to cut out the things I don't need/weigh me down, and my passion as a tech enthusiast that got me here before I started the minimalism journey.

Does anyone here understand my experience? If so, what are your thoughts on resolving this inner conflict?",minimalism,1737992387.0

"An emotional attachment to a certain item can be natural in certain situations, as a minimalist person","At the airport today, I chose to forfeit to TSA a reusable water bottle that I have used for nearly ~4-5years now.

I didn't buy it for much but I was sad for a bit because I was proud about how long I have been using it for (it also matched my lunch box lol).

Why does everything need to be commodified?,"(Correction to title: [ending] to be of value?)

I just started working on assembling a recipe book of all my favorite ones into a journal, which I can then access whenever I feel like making something for myself and any loved ones or special occasions. I brought this up to someone, and instead of wishing me luck or feeling happy for my new endeavor, they made a comment about how after I worked on it, I could then create a digital/print book to sell it.

What‚Äôs wrong with just keeping something for myself and those that I would want to pass it down to? Why does everything have to be a product? I feel like it loses its unique and special nature, when something is overly shared or made for the purpose of profit as the end goal. This is an idea that has plagued a lot of my own past hobbies and sucked the joy out of them, so much so that I was unable to return to some past interests without feeling like I was wasting time, effort, or materials. Anybody else relate to this?

Maybe this doesn‚Äôt belong on this subreddit, but it definitely made me think of it because of the way an end product has to be multiplied and of value to someone else to be worthwhile. Sometimes things can just exist on their own, be one of its kind and a representation of some aspect of one‚Äôs life, as something intangible that can stand the test of a time‚Äîfor the joy of its singularity.",minimalism,1737939247.0

Relationship minimalism,"I haven't heard much about relationship and friendship minimalism and I'm curious if anyone else extends their minimalist values to include how they conduct themselves socially...

I have found that having less friends deliberately and being extremely selective socially has helped me filter out people who wanted to use me for money, favours, or to turn me into their 24/7 on-call therapist.

I have 3 friends right now and one of them lives far away, and this feels right to me, because I have more time for myself.

I also only really talk to family members with whom I want a genuine and deep connection, except for when it's a holiday or something and then I just send a ""happy holidays"" and good wishes message.

Not comparing my social life to others' social lives and not being on social media except for Reddit and YouTube has helped a lot with maintaining and enjoying this lifestyle.

I am wondering if anyone else has extended the concept of minimalism to encompass personal relationships and how its affected the quality of your relationships...

Mental Health and DIY projects,"I'm having some issues in my life that I believe are attributed to owning things.

Things that require time and energy. Maintaining vehicles is probably the worst offender. I am mechanically inclined enough to do all my own work on vehicles. I save so much money doing work myself, but the amount of time, energy, and tools it requires is getting to my mental health.

What I struggle with is the value of service. For example, I priced out a differential fluid change on my vehicle. The dealer wanted $1699 to do the work, which includes a bunch of other jazz. So that was obviously way too much, so I reached out to an independent mechanic. They wanted $500 with labour to do a boiled down amount of work on the car.

I went to the store and priced out everything I need to do the work. $160. Literally 1/10th the cost of the dealership.

Does anyone feel like their penchant for minimalism is a trauma thing?,"I've always felt drawn to minimalism as long as I can remember (which is from around 14 on), and I suspect that part of it stems from the fact that as a kid I moved around a lot because my parents couldn't afford our homes, and was frequently homeless (whether in a shelter or crashing with extended family.

"The reasons for clutter, examples. What do you think?","One is of course the hoarding compulsion, that can be present in varying degree.

In my extended family I've also noticed other reasons for overwhelming clutter in the house, that is not necessarily due to a high degree of hoarding (although it may contribute a little): 

- lack of organisation 
- low purpose for the various spaces

These two are interrelated. Basically, most of the items happen to inhabit a space with a very vague organisation, while many happen to sit somewhere without a practical reason.
E.g. part of a countertop in the kitchen has a blob of medicines, seamlessly transitioning to tea bags and teapots and coffee beans and related stuff. On the kitchen floor boxes with vegetable, pans, trash, all in one square mound.
Beds are regularly used for storing washed clothes and spare blankets. People sleep using half of the bed.

Also, old photographs that were taken out to show me 1 year ago are still spread on a desk catching dust, indicating a general lack of interest for the spaces, or the items themselves. Or it's selective blindness?

This didn't happen in one day, but was the result of ~10 years of habitation. My feeling is that hoarding is not the culprit, but mostly lack of planning for processes (i.e. trash management, kitchen procedures that dictate the sorting of the utensils, etc.) and clearly defined homes for each item category.

Do you agree with my interpretation of such a situation?

Would encouraging organisation help with the problem?

Need help deciding what to do with my CD collection,"**TL;DR: never thought of parting with my CD collection; idea of doing so was triggered when I realized I dislike the look of my CD rack in my new home. Unsure if I should get rid of the whole collection, part of it, just the rack, or none of the above.** 

I have a pretty large CD collection. I'm a bit nostalgic about the medium itself tbh. I know it's much easier to listen to digital music nowadays, but I still have my old stereo with CD player, which I do use occasionally (not as often as I used to back in the day, obviously). 
Most of them, I admit, are from an era in my life I've moved on from - obscure subgenres, rare finds I was proud of 20 years ago, ""genre classics"" I just *need* to have in my collection - and I've been keeping them because they're part of my collection, not because I really listen to them now. (I was a total music nerd back then.) There are some treasured favourites, but most aren't. 

I recently moved and still have all the CDs in boxes. In my old apartment I had them in a large wall mounted CD rack which held almost all of them, and a few extras were on a small floating shelf (mostly because they have special packaging too thick for the rack).
Today when an acquaintance was over to help mount some shelves, I expressed that I'm not sure where to mount my CD rack as I can't figure out a space on my wall that would look good. Said acquaintance then confirmed that the rack isn't very stylish, that it would make the wall look cluttered, and proceeded to suggest I keep them in a drawer (and get rid of the rack.) When I told them there were too many CDs to fit in a drawer, they were baffled about how many I have, and proceeded to give some friendly suggestions which I feel won't really work for me either. 

I didn't come to a conclusion so they're still in boxes for now. And now I'm starting to doubt if I should even keep my collection at all. 

Here's my dilemma: 

- I do want to achieve an uncluttered look and lifestyle. I don't have any collections or sentimental items on display, the CD collection was my only exception. 

- I used to like that they were displayed on a wall instead of occupying space elsewhere (though I admit I hated the dust on them, but at least they're easy to wipe). 

- I'm not sure why I no longer like the look of that particular CD rack; it's in perfect condition and holds a large collection so wouldn't it be stupid to get rid of it? Why create a new task for myself, buying another storage for my CDs? 

- Should I get rid of some? If so, which ones? ""I hardly listen to it"" won't work as a criterion since I hardly listen to *any* of them. Might as well get rid of all and just digitalise. 

- Or maybe keep only a few favourites and, actually, put them in a drawer. But where would I draw the line? 

- And will I miss some of them for their decorative aspect (cool cover)? Will I miss the music itself? Will I miss owning ""rarities""? 

I have no idea how to tackle this and am so confused about what I want. I'm really bad at decision making in general (I have ADHD), and at decluttering specifically. Any thoughts about this will be appreciated!!

recommendation for minimizing light with Venetian Blinds,"
My room is equipped with standard Venetian blinds, but the issue is the bright roll lights from the road outside at night. The light seeps through the blinds and makes my room uncomfortably bright. I have dry eyes and am very sensitive to light, so this has been a real problem for me.

I‚Äôve tried wearing an eye mask at night, but it‚Äôs uncomfortable, so now I‚Äôm exploring other solutions. Ideally, I‚Äôd like to keep things minimalist and not make drastic changes.

Cleansing social media fire,"I‚Äôm just now winding down a three year decluttering journey. I still have a way to go, but the bulk of my hoard has been sold/give as gifts. I noticed though‚Ä¶ the drain on my time was still high, and my stress level had not gone down. The culprit? My tech. 

I deleted all streaming services, and now use my old iPod classic. (No more ads draining my emotional state). 

I got rid of Hulu, and cable. I intentionally order and watch what I want from the library. Again‚Ä¶ no ads or money drain. 

I deleted all social media, and this has been the greatest happiness boost. (I keep Reddit, but it‚Äôs honestly draining sometimes too)

I deleted Amazon Prime too‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt buy the thing, and if I really need it I get it from the store. 

My only recurring tech payment is my phone with included hotspot. It was weird for a day, but now I really don‚Äôt miss any of it. I‚Äôm shocked by how much time I wasted, and how much control this technology has over me.

The elusive capsule wardrobe (what am I doing wrong??),"In the past four years I've had two kids (my youngest is 5 months) and tried to get down to a true capsule wardrobe many, many times. There were times where I felt really good about it! But multiple pregnancies, weight gain/loss, identity changes, etc. keep putting me back to what feels like Square One all over again. 

My goal is to feel really good about the pieces that I have. I mainly wear black, white, some blues and blush pink, so theoretically it should be easy to match pieces. I also work from home and don't do a lot of ""fancy"" stuff so I mainly need casual outfits for when I leave the house and/or have work Zoom calls and want to feel put together for the day. 

Below are some of the challenges I am experiencing, perhaps it'll help someone else see where I'm failing:

1. I don't love my denim. Each time I'm like ""ugg which of these two pairs of jeans should I wear today?"" but then don't love them. 

2. I have some good ""basic"" tops but I feel bored by them. White and black tees, for example. Sweaters that seems too casual or boring. What I'm missing are pieces that still feel elevated and fun, my unique style, that feel good to wear out to dinners, parties, etc. For some reason though, I don't seem to buy them every time I end up trying to fill the wardrobe gaps. 

3. Related to above...a lot of my clothes feel ""boring"" to me. My husband is tired of hearing this lol. But how do I find something that has character and still will stand the test of time? I obviously don't want to go too trendy either. Often I end up shopping at places that are serving the lowest common denominator if you know what I mean. 

4. Since I'm not happy with a lot of the pieces, I end up feeling like I always need to ""fix"" this capsule wardrobe thing, but I then I get all in my head about the consumerism and frantic feeling that I need to shop to solve a problem. It's so frustrating! 

A big part of this is likely my desire to express myself through my appearance...perhaps now that I'm a mom of two kids there's a part of me who is unclear about my new identity. No more crop tops and skimpy dresses hahaha. 

Anyways, if you're still reading, thanks for sticking with me! 

I'd love to hear from others who feel they have successfully created their capsule wardrobe and they actually love all their pieces. Did you do it gradually over time? How did you do so without feeling like you always needed to be shopping? Obviously I'd like to avoid that feeling :)",minimalism,1737412819.0
Struggling to find myself & need some advice‚Ä¶ ,"hi all! Thank you so much for taking your time to read this and respond. For context I am a 29-year-old female and a first-time mom to a sweet little boy. 

over my life, I have been raised country. I live on a farm with my family and had horses, cattle, goats, ducks, everything. Once I hit high school, I developed a girly girl stage. I loved makeup, skin care, dressing up all of those things. And truly, those characteristics have stuck with me since. I have been obsessed with buying new make up and skin care items as well as new outfits consistently. I loved it so much. I even decided to start up my own women‚Äôs online shop. However, over the last year, I have really been craving a simple, minimalist lifestyle. I want to thrift more and instead of buying everything brand new and causing more waste get everything secondhand. Well, this really clashes with my lifestyle as a business owner. In my business, I carry contemporary western wear/BoHo outfits. I also have some beauty and skin care options as well. I do plan on revamping and providing only products that are ethically made, but I still have a hard time promoting my own business because I hate pushing the agenda that people need more more more. 

secondly, I have always wanted to be a content creator. When I was nine years old, I started my own YouTube channel and tried to create videos! I genuinely have so much love for a simple life, but also need/want to post about my boutique to make money. I also love things like Disney, Star Wars, reading fantasy books, etc. I want to post about those things as well, but they don‚Äôt necessarily align with a simple/minimalist lifestyle.

so, I have two questions. The first one being how would you go about the business? Do I still continue done this journey or do I completely revamp? Secondly, do you feel that creating content about all of these ideas would be successful, even though they kind of clash together? 

I am just really having a hard time having a lifestyle of all the things that I want. Thank you so much, I really hope I‚Äôm not the only person that struggles with something like this! ",minimalism,1737404495.0

Does anyone else struggle to fill the void that consumerism held?,"I feel like I've been largely successful after a few years of rounds of decluttering, evaluation of the self, etc. I'm at a mental hurdle where I just do not find any enjoyment anymore in the accumulation, in the hunt, in the maintenance of items. Some might say that's a success story and I would be prone to agree. I do still indulge in luxuries but it's very sparse as I am not in the city as any of my friends so traveling is my only real indulgence. This is not a mental ever-presence that plagues me, but it does leave a hole of physical and mental occupancy I've not been able to fill yet. 

For a while I was making an active effort to stay off of socials. IG has been an easy one. I got rid of snapchat years ago. Twitter was come and go but with twitter and reddit, I find myself simply uninterested. I'm realizing the lack of value that most online presences have added to my life. In the last few weeks I've found myself prodding the dead horse of this subreddit less and less. Dead as in, it just doesn't offer me anything anymore (not a shade, just an observation).

I'm very much feeling ""lost"" in a sense of speaking. I do have hobbies and with all this extra time I'm hoping to get back into them. I'm fixing my sleep schedule. I just have so much time for introspection that is nice but sometimes the silence is deafening. I am really not sure if this is a flavor of depression unique to falling out of interest to all the quick-dopamine stimulus? I don't find myself missing my weekly thrifting trips or traditional social media anymore. People have my discord and my number and I like having only two closed communication bubbles. I'm just staggered and feel adrift with so much time.

How wardrobe minimalism actually affects daily decision-making - Data Analysis,"I've been studying the relationship between wardrobe size and decision-making efficiency. The results challenge some common assumptions.   
  
Findings:   
  
1. Sweet Spot   
People with 40-50 versatile pieces report highest satisfaction with their wardrobes, regardless of lifestyle.   
  
2. Quality Over Quantity   
Users with fewer, higher-quality pieces report 60% less decision fatigue than those with larger, mixed-quality wardrobes.   
  
3. The Integration Factor   
Successfully minimalist wardrobes aren't just small - they're highly integrated, with each piece matching at least 70% of other items.",minimalism,1737283338.0
Change my views on exercise and its cognitive benefits ,"This ain‚Äôt a well thought out post and I need your input lmao.
  
After listening to Andrew Huberman and Peter Attia, here‚Äôs the general guideline they suggest:
Cardio: A couple of hours a week.
Resistance training: 2-3x a week.
HIIT: ~30 minutes a week.

My View:
Cardio: Based on the CDC, 75-150 minutes of cardio is more than enough to get most of the cognitive benefits from exercise. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily involve jogging or running, Type 2 cardio, like fast walking, is sufficient for optimal results.

Resistance Training: The benefits of resistance training are mostly related to boosting testosterone, IGF-1, and increasing BDNF. For testosterone, low and high levels seem to be the most problematic. A study shows that having moderate testosterone levels is the most beneficial for fluid intelligence, while high testosterone is known to reduce spatial and non-verbal intelligence. Increasing IGF-1 is beneficial for kids below the age of 10 but isn‚Äôt particularly helpful for adults. As for BDNF, most of it is produced during cardio. Meditation and even drinking coffee can also increase BDNF.

HIIT: There‚Äôs no unique benefit HIIT provides that cardio doesn‚Äôt, except when it comes to improving VO2 max. However, VO2 max is already highly correlated with resting heart rate, and training specifically for it won‚Äôt make you any better at cognitive tests.

Exercise offers several benefits, such as hippocampal neurogenesis, BDNF boost, and increased neuroplasticity, which are mostly achieved through 75-150 minutes of Type 2 cardio (fast walking) which most of us get indirectly through daily activities.

Resistance training can be useful later in life (near retirement) to prevent sarcopenia or osteoporosis, but beyond that, it‚Äôs not very beneficial, especially not HIIT.",minimalism,1737278134.0

Thrift shopping out of boredom / latent hoarder tendencies. preventative minimalism help!,"I think I'm a low-key maximalist with harder tendencies and I'm constantly fighitng against it. I Kando'd my stuff twice in 3 years due to relocations and it honetly felt wonderful, but I invariably re-fill my closets and drawers with stuff. 

I grew up in hurricane alley in a big house, my dad is a professional DIY type and artist, so there have been piles of home/engine/boat repair shit plus emergency supplies everywhere in the house my whole childhood. I was pretty broke from highschool until about 35 years old. I've bought 90% of my clothes at thrift stores.

Honestly going thrift shopping is one of my favorite things to do. It was alwasy a cost effetive pass-time, much cheaper than going drinking or killing time at the mall etc.

the problem is, of course, that I end up buying stuff. ""great deals"" they may be, but often times I never get the stuff tailored and I just take them to a different thrift store 2 years later. Or the fun / kitchy / weird things I discover take up space on a shelf and eventually multply and become clutter.

so there's the problem, You can purge all day but if the in-puts don't stop your still in a cluttered dump.

how do I break myself of this habit/hobby/legit source of fun? Everything else is boring. I live in the burbs outside of DC, there's fuck-all to do. Going into the city is an order and there's nothing to do that isn't exorbitantly expensive (yes there are free museums, once you've been to them all you can't really do them over and over for fun).

Maybe that's the real source of the problem, i'm bored as hell. Most days off I'd rather be at work becuase I'm just standing around...bored.

I'd love to hear what people do to stay busy/distracted.

"Update: not really trying a no buy, just trying to buy with common sense - smartphone/tech addicted","Hello everyone.
I wrote about my struggle some time ago but never been explaining 

Wall of text incoming, sorry

Here it is:
I consider myself a smartphone/tech addicted, working with a mobile company only did me worst. In 2020 I had (seriously) 80 smartphones and tech stuff from all the eras around my house‚Ä¶I kept switching smartphone every day just to feel what was better. My house was a dumpster.
it was unsustainable.
Lucky for me I found an amazing (and pain in the ass sometimes) girl who was my opposite in this thing. I spent days -years to be honest- wondering ‚Äúif that iPhone was better than that Samsung or OnePlus, but maybe lg is an underdog‚Äù and she lived quietly and happily with her 16gb 4year old Wiko‚Ä¶
For a while I tried to convince her to switch and do like me‚Ä¶and I did it.
She switched for a Sony Xperia.
She loved it a lot and I was happy for her. Unfortunately she has been robbed at the beginning of the 2021 so she needed a replacement.
Lucky enough I was in the apple master program with my work, so every year I had the base iPhone for free. Useful to say that this did not stop me and I bought a 12 mini when it came out for myself just to sell it some months later because it was too small.
This to say I had an experience and my apple supervisor, hearing my complaints about it, just gave me another one for free, saying ‚Äúgive it another shot ‚Äú. This one I decided to give it to my girl‚Ä¶as usual, she loved it (hating apple closed ecosystem) and she is still rocking it today.

In the years I sold almost everything I had in my house, in late 2022 I quit my job and started to invest on my instruction to change my lifestyle and job possibilities. And it worked!! Now I have a corporate job and my addiction is waaaay better.

But‚Ä¶

At the beginning of the year I found myself googling about a new phone coming up and already paid the deposit for it, Then I cancelled it as it was really costly here in Europe.
A week later I found myself buying and receiving 2 smartphones.
This week I decided the best thing for me was to sell everything stupid I bought and send to repair my old but perfect (cracked screen) oneplus 6.
It can run a custom rom and be updated and used as a daily driver for my crazy switching moments, so I would not be in search of another one and not buying anymore.

Now waiting for it to come back.

Actions to apply minimalism with books and reading,"This year I have decided to focus more on reading than on buying books. I have been reading for pleasure for several years and have set an annual reading goal, which I have met well. However, I always get the urge or impulse to buy books (mainly digital) that pile up and I don't read. I now have a library of more than 150 titles, so this year I have set myself a challenge: not to buy books for a whole year. These are the rules of the challenge:

  


1. Do not buy any books until January 2026 (neither digital nor physical).

  


2. The challenge ends in January 2026, but can be extended until I finish all the books I have.

  


3. Adapt my reading to each situation I face during the year (my library contains books that reflect my personal interests: minimalism, lifestyle, philosophy, novels, literary classics, etc.).

  


\*Books that I must read for work or academic subjects could be an exception.

  


At the end of the first year of the challenge, I will review how it went and decide whether to continue it. The idea is to create a balance so that I can take advantage of and enjoy the books I already have, without being distracted by thinking about acquiring new ones.",minimalism,1737130400.0

Downsizing when you invested in items,"I'm wondering how people cope with downsizing when there's monetary value and potential functions for things you own.


For example, I don't make much money. I'm pretty into fashion. I'd love to downsize my closet. But, some of my clothing isn't cheap and could still serve me for years and years. Shoes, for example, have a lifespan. So if I already have a few extra pair of shoes, it'll stretch the lifespan of the ones I wear, because I won't wear the same pair every day. It can feel difficult to get rid of stuff when it feels like I'm taking a monetary loss. 

I could sell stuff second-hand, but rarely do you get a good deal. Better than nothing, I suppose

The perfect amount of shoes,"I feel like I found the perfect amount of shoes for my lifestyle so I wanted to share with you guys.   
  
My everyday shoes:  
1. ~~Sandals (summer)~~
2. Loafers (summer + autumn)
3. Waterproof sneakers (fall + autumn)
4. Ankle booties (fall + winter)  
5. Knee-high boots (winter)  

My everyday shoes are all barefoot shoes. I‚Äôm currently too self-conscious about them looking like clown shoes, which is why I have two non-barefoot pairs for fancy/professional events:

1. Shiny black Mary-Janes (feminine vibe)
2. Dress shoes (masculine vibe)


The shoes I need for my hobbies:  
1. Motorcycle boots in case I ever crash on my bike   
2. Trail runners, which function as both my hiking shoes and running shoes  
3. Indoor gym shoes for weight lifting 
  
Then what is left:  
1. ~~Indoor slippers~~ Rubber slides (used outdoor in summer and indoor in winter)
2. ~~Flip-flops are mandatory for swimming pools and public saunas.~~
3. Rubber rain booties as garden slippers. Sometimes I also take them camping and to muddy festivals.
  
That's ~~13~~ 11 in total. I guess I could reduce that number, but not without sacrificing hobbies, hygiene or comfort.

Functioning w/o social media,"Genuine question for those who own businesses, are active in the community, or are a part of non-profit group. Can you function without social media and still fulfill your obligations/stay connected to your community?

Context: I own a local business and am part of non-profit leadership in a rural, small town (County pop. 13k, city pop. 6k). We have no central source of information distribution aside from FB and Insta. We have a tiny, weekly paper that only old people read and all of our radio stations come from bigger cities nearby. Because of this, all advertising or notice of events and news takes place through word of mouth or local FB groups and posts. I would love to disconnect and not deal with social media on a personal level but I feel that it is very much a requirement for functioning in my area on a community level. Without it, I have no way of learning about what's happening locally or of spreading the word about my own events and efforts.

Maintenance of minimalist lifestyle,"Hi All! 
I've been a minimalist for good few years now. Went through the ruthless decluttering stage, the counting stage, tiny living situation stage, clean black and white home decor stage, capsule wardrobe, digital minimalism, lifestyle essentialist etc., you know how it goes I bet. 

At the moment I've found myself to be much less occupied with all that, although the skills and mindset I've learned do help me day to day. I do declutter periodically, usually room by room, whenever I feel like the situation calls for it or if I have to reorganize something. 

Question to all of the seasoned minimalists: have you also found yourselves to be a bit less radical in time? Or the other way around: you're still counting stuff years into it with rigid rules? Or maybe you're lurking here still, but went fully in the other direction?

Are there any rules that you still follow 100%, or do you now rely on your intuition more? Anything you do or keep in mind to maintain the lifestyle? ",minimalism,1736789091.0

Third world relatives and guilt,"Can anyone relate to this: having extended family in poor parts of the world makes it super hard for me to get rid of things.

E.g. Right now I'm looking at a pair of shoes. I can't even remember if they were a gift or what, because they're not my style. 

Another example, a science kit that kids have outgrown.

Ok, so take them to the charity shop.

But

With the science kit I know that the charity shop will probably throw it out, as it is too battered. So I put it in the attic thinking, I'll do a yard sale/car boot sale, and at least someone will want it for free. 

Or when someone is flying out to the old country they could take this. Of course they can't. Their one bag allowance is for clothes and actual nice new gifts.

The shoes, I think: I could get ¬£5 for them, send a ¬£5 when someone is going to the old country. I never do.

Or a mug with a chip on the outside and which was a shitty souvenir type of thing to start with. No one is going to want that.

My house is overflowing with such things. 

I think, ok, do Freecycle or something. But it just feels stressful to coordinate pick up with a stranger. I don't want them coming to my house.

So three categories of things 
(1) Things which retain utility but are too battered looking to sell.
(2) Things I feel I should sell to pass on the money, but which I never do because it feels like too much hassle. 
(3) Things no one would pay for and probably wouldn't even want for free, but where it feels monstrous to put them in the bin/garbage.

Minimalism and ADHD,"A few months ago, I got completely hyper-focused on minimalism and started throwing away or giving away everything. I gave away all these art supplies that I wasn't using at the time, a lot of my spiritual stuff, decor stuff, clothes, books, etc...

I genuinely felt like the items didn't bring me joy at the time, but it's because I have ADHD and I change my mind about things a lot, and so after a few months, I regretted giving away so many things and had to spend some money replacing some stuff that was actually useful and made me happy!

That's why I think that extreme minimalism is not for everyone and not the answer to all of life's problems and definitely not the answer to mental health issues.

However, I created my own way of being minimalist that works for my ADHD:

1. Minimalism in the kitchen - minimal amount of pots, pans, and other supplies, minimal use of a few herbs and spices that work well for me in recipes, sticking to simple one-pot recipes

2. Minimalist skin care - I often feel exhausted and mentally paralyzed, so I stick to using a gentle soap and moisturizer for skin care and don't do anything fancy (especially because I am broke and have sensitive skin)

3. Digital minimalism - deleted most of my social media except what I need to find information and ideas, or stuff I need for my career (YouTube, Reddit, and LinkedIn), also set up time restrictions on my phone and the chrome browser I use

4. Relationship minimalism - only choosing friendships and relationships that actually bring me joy and bring out the best in me, and then I'm a bit less distracted and pick up my phone a lot less since I have less people to message now and the quality of my interactions has improved drastically since

5. Career minimalism - I am choosing a job that pays less but allows me the freedom, time, and energy to focus on what brings me joy..,it's a low prestige job too! It's great though because I worry a lot less now and have job stability. It helps me with my ADHD a lot because I can hyper-focus on what interests me and also have the flexibility to take breaks and move around throughout my shifts

Minimalism and skin/haircare products,"Forewarning, if you aren't into skincare or makeup this post may make you roll your eyes and you can just keep scrolling :D - This is something that I have gone back to many times. I will see a skin or hair care product or be dissatisfied with one that I've bought, want to try another, or think I need some sort of new type of facial makeup. I end up with a bunch of things that I never end up using because I don't have the time or motivation to use them. I work in a fast paced healthcare setting where, in my opinion, doing full makeup is not only not necessary but will probably just smudge or get all over when you're trying to do your job. I've considered just throwing away almost all of my products, including the clay masks, most of my serums, because I've ended up with several that do the same thing after buying trial kits of some brand. Like, I just bought a murad dark-spot correcting serum because I saw it had great reviews and I've developed more little freckles and what I think is discoloration in a few areas on my face. I've used the serum for couple of months now and notice no change. It was $20 for probably .5-1oz of the serum. Not as expensive as some, but it just doesn't work. I think that masks make your skin feel better right after using them, but other than that I've noticed no real benefit to my skin. I have three different detangling sprays, which i do need and use every day. The other stuff I just get sick of sitting on my dresser, accumulating in other areas, and never really caring to go through the whole skincare regimen that using all of them would require.

I would be happier with less and I want to try being a humble traveling artist. I don‚Äôt make much income during this transition, so I do feel like owning less will give me more control and stability by providing freedom to move my work (art supplies) smoothly.

A financial minimalism question,"I would like to start by stating how grateful I am for my situation, as I know many are not so fortunate. I'm 27 years old, and my lovely fianc√© and I are about 6 months from having the rest of our student loans paid off. We have an incredible income (I'm an ICU PA-C, and she's a social worker) and we gross about 185,000 annually before taxes. 

We've been on a debt pay off and financial journey for about 2 years. We have been living substantially below our means in that time. I save about 20% of my gross income towards retirement, which is arguably way too much, and I plan to drop this to 15% when I turn 30. About 25% goes away to taxes (oh well), and another 25% has been going towards loans. So all in all, we've been living on 55K annually (with 2 cats and a dog, 2300/month mortgage, groceries, gas, utilities, and a small fun money margin) by not eating out, not traveling, and fighting temptation to consume. 

  
My actual minimalist question is; soon once our debt is gone and we have a 4 month emergency fund, our income will rise substantially by the 30% or so we've been saving so aggressively. Being intentional with purchases, not over consuming, and being generous are important to us. **I want advice on how I can help curb lifestyle creep and overconsumption when we'll have an extra $35,000 annually to spend!** We are huge on travel, nothing lavish, but want to take backpacking trips and fly places. Some of our baseline expenses will increase, ei grocery budget as we want to shift from shopping aldi, to local small grocers and a local CSA for our meat and produce. But all in all, I'm nervous that we may get carried away with having the means to kind of buy whatever the hell we want.

Cut to the past few years and I keep wondering why I feel so crappy and sad. I came to realize that minimalism is not for me. At least the way that I have been trying to implement it.

My own home where I live with my 2 kids is very small. We‚Äôre talking 900 sq. Ft small. I also have ADHD and the clutter created by all of our ‚Äúthings‚Äù in this tiny home was driving me bonkers, so steadily I‚Äôve purged and purged. 

I just spent the last 3 snow days decluttering my entire first floor (3 rooms) and from just those 3 spaces I managed to fill 8 boxes and bins with items to donate, recycled 3 bags worth of glass bottles and other recyclables, and had 4 giant garbage bags to take out, AND LET ME TELL YOU I FEEL SO GREAT ü•∞ü•≥ 

My tiny home feels so much nicer and spacious! And it‚Äôs helped me really evaluate my past purchases as well as examine my own psychological attachment/habits. I feel a lot more in control of my well-being and my head is clearer. There are so many perks to a minimalist lifestyle I‚Äôm just sorry I didn‚Äôt embark on this path much earlier in life. Would‚Äôve saved me so much heartache and unnecessary stress. 

I really want to get my mom (and my brother & SIL) on board as they‚Äôre all hoarders - ones organized the other is disorganized. Has anyone had any success talking to a parent about going to therapy for a hoarding complex‚Ä¶? I‚Äôd love any input if you‚Äôve got it. I just want my family to realize how much freer life is when you don‚Äôt have STUFF shoved everywhere and into everything. I also get anxiety just thinking about having to clean my parents house out down the line. It‚Äôs overwhelming. 

Anyway, minimalism is great. ",minimalism,1736389596.0
Lipstick dilemma - please help,"TL;DR in the last paragraph. 

Hello everybody,
I'm new to the sub, but definitely not new to minimalism. Looking for advice. This post will probably be way too long for the dilemma I'm facing, I'm sorry.

My flavour of minimalism is a bit different, as I do stock up on consumable items, especially since I have my favourites and they are often not widely sold. Some stuff is easy to decide: toothpaste, shampoo, deodorant, the daily basics. Some stuff though, like make-up, I use regularly, but not daily. I have just one small drawer of make- up and skincare, which I revisit twice a year to see if anything is nearing its end to possibly rebuy. And here we come to my dilemma: 

After years of trial and mostly error I found a lipstick I love to wear. For a long time it was my only lipstick in only one shade that I just bought over and over again, it suited me, I had no desire to experiment, you could even say it was my signature colour. I wanted to get another one for New year... It's discontinued. The only shop (online) that still sells this lipstick in my country ran out of my 'signature' colour. I got a bit crazy and ordered 4 different colours of the same lipstick just for the formula, hoping that one of them would also suit me. 2 out of the 4 are absolute hits. Love them, even more than the previous one, it's  even better, as they are just two different shades of one colour (one deep and edgy and the other lighter and more neutral: office vibes). The formula is the same of course, so no issue here. Now here's the problem: said shop only has 16 pieces of one and 9 of the other. There will not be anymore, as the whole line is discontinued. 

Another 'problem' (or solution)is: this is not an expensive lipstick. I could, theoretically, go completely bananas, get all of them and keep them safe in my pantry which holds a steady slightly below room temperature in hopes of not having to return to lipstick seeking in the foreseeable future. Make-up doesn't spoil that easily, especially if it's unopened. 

Now on one hand it's healthy to just let it go, enjoy the two new shades I have for as long as they last and call it a day. 

On the other hand I feel like companies do this on purpose, so you are kept clueless and looking for another thing that would work the way the original did, spending more money in the process on lipsticks (or whatever else) that you'll end up throwing away unused. It annoys me and I kind of feel like getting a prepper- level amount of favourite lipstick is a tiny act of rebellion against this stupid industry. 

Thoughts?

TL;DR: my (one and only favourite) lipstick has been discontinued. Do I stock up from the only shop in my country that still holds a few, or am I insane to even consider getting years worth of it? It's not expensive. 

UPDATE: thank you everyone for your insights! I got 10 of them in the end, which is both more than necessary and at the same time less than I was tempted to get.  üíã For Y'all!",minimalism,1736374921.0

"Personal style/expression, particularly thoughts from other women please!","Long time reader, first time poster in here. 

I‚Äôve experienced having a big closet, a tiny closet, a lot of clothes, very few clothes, the whole gamut really.

Thoughts on minimalism while still keeping the big house?,"We moved into the ‚Äúdream house‚Äù last year. Two little kids, dog, and both me and husband work from home offices.

My husband is not as committed to minimalism as me. I‚Äôm the one who cleans and manages the house, so of course I want to downsize. This isn‚Äôt happening in the near future though, so here‚Äôs my question:

Who here ended up keeping the big house? Did embracing minimalism cut down on the regular cleaning and house mgmt that is required? I want to believe the answer can be yes, but perhaps I‚Äôm kidding myself.

minimalism and pregnancy,"after being quite minimalist for most of my 20s, my early 30s allowed me more space and resources to expand. probably too much. 

pregnancy has been a wake up call. First, I stopped fitting into 90% of my clothes. Now, they're all packed up to go through after the baby comes. But I feel like I'll want to get rid of most of them.

Now, I have very few outfits that I can functionally wear because of not wanting to over do it on maternity wear. It's kind of amazing to have no choices. 

I also need to go through all my personal things, books, digital clutter, etc. before the baby comes as my space for these will be the nursery. It's scary but I feel like I'll just... let so much go.

Iphone (12 mini) case + wallet recs? No foldover,"I've had a phone wallet case for a while and I've come to prefer it over a wallet; I only ever need to carry 3-4 cards anyways, rarely ever hold cash, and I've never lost my phone, but I have lost my wallet/had it slip out of my pocket multiple times. I used a [Smartish case](https://smartish.com/products/wallet-slayer-vol-1-card-case-for-iphone-13-mini-5-4) on my old phone and wanted to maybe get something similar.

I'm not using any wallet case that opens/flips over my screen, and I'd like to avoid any wallet cases that have weak, thin hinges, I had one of those a while ago and they tend to snap off and not be very durable. I'd also like to avoid any cases that show half of the card itself, though like the Smartish case its ok if a tiny bit does show itself. I was looking at the [Schooch](https://scooch.com/products/wingmate-for-iphone-12-mini?variant=43460542234779) case but I'm not a fan of how it looks, but if anyone has used it let me know how it is!

I snapped,"One Reddit Account and too many months ago I posted in this subreddit about how I have locked up quite a big part of my belongings I no longer want nor need in my daily life in order to ‚Äûtame the beast‚Äú.  My goal was to declutter it all by Christmas, well, that mission has failed.  
Today I was watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKxl-oukXmU) video and had a physical feeling of big the discrepancy of how I live versus how I want to live has gotten. This sudden burst of energy resulted in me snapping. I brought a few of my containers filled with stuff into the living room and sorted the insides into 4 categories:  
\- keep  
\- sell/donate  
\- not my stuff  
\- sentimental

I ended up keeping roughly a quarter of the things I went through today. Mostly I kept things I feel obliged to keep such as the T-Shirts I was gifted but never wear and don‚Äòt ever will wear. But this is appears to be a battle for another day.  
So I snapped and worked a little bit towards how I want to be and live - this might just be enough for today.

Mental Health Discoveries (Good&Bad),"I'm curious about others. For myself, I've been doing it for a few years. I'm overall happier. However, I've discovered I have an addiction to streamlining facets of my life and get a large dopamine rush from them. After a few years of this and having less than I've ever had in my life, I'm more calm and at peace and less stressed. But I don't have anything new to really replace the dopamine rush spare playing instruments and video games with friends and my partner. Overall, I feel like there is still a huge void left in the wake of removing the consumer part of who I was. Buying things for the most part, is not an interest to me which is great. My wallet is thankful.  
  
I'm finding more and more yearning for a community that I do not have, which is unfortunately why I hang around online spaces so much. I don't use twitter or instagram and haven't for quite a while now. I'm hoping to develop a less attached relationship to reddit soon (I feel the frustrations outweighing the benefits, so I feel like I'm already on the right path) People can only access me by text and discord and I do really enjoy the quiet that a tech-lite (relative to most of the world) has offered me. It's given me time to face uncomfortable feelings (like now) with myself and try to work forward towards something better. This experience has facilitated more for myself than therapy ever has (not shafting therapy, just an observation).

But idk. I'm missing community but it feels like I'm lacking something even deeper than that. I didn't have any aim for minimalism to fix that. It has actually done what I wanted, which was to give myself space to breathe and be with my thoughts and not to be occupied with static and noise.

Fantasy Self or an Actual Desire?,"With minimalism, there's sometimes talk about the fantasy self. You keep or/and buy things for a fantasy self, someone you want to be but someone you'll never be. E.g., buying a lot of books because you want to be an avid reader and have a nice collection, but in the end you barely read anything because you'd rather do something else. Maybe you wanted to come across as well-read or you liked what people who read a lot represents to you. But being a bookworm isn't who you really are. 

Well, Marie Kondo talks about ''Think about your ideal future, who do you want to be, what kind of life you want'' when decluttering. I think it's helpful, but this also makes me wonder. What's the difference between an actual desired future self VS fantasy self? How do you make the distinction?

Reducing hobbies advice please,"I‚Äôm at a point in my minimalism journey where I have reduced clothes, toiletries, kitchen items etc down to somewhere I‚Äôm happy with. However my greatest amount of items I now own are hobby related. 

I seem to find this the hardest area to reduce as I dip in and out of hobbies over the course of a year, however they take up a vast amount of space. For example I love to upcycle clothes, however, all the machinery, fabrics and equipment for sewing take up a lot of space. Similarly with crochet, I have accumulated so much yarn for projects, however, I have just reached a point of overwhelm where I don‚Äôt know where to start. Other stuff related hobbies I do include jewellery making, lino cutting, playing instruments (I am down to one acoustic guitar , one electric and one bass), then there‚Äôs the active hobbies like yoga, I have a pole for pole dancing, a hula hoop.

It just feels like downsizing in any one of these areas feels like giving up on a dream. It‚Äôs just difficult as I am not even sure myself which passion I want to continue enjoying or to dedicate my time to 100%. I love creative hobbies but they just bring so much clutter along with them. And fully decluttering any one of them feels like giving up a part of myself. I do realise as I‚Äôm typing that this i have a heavy attachment to these hobby items. 

I guess what I‚Äôm asking, is that I would love to focus on a few select hobbies but with more dedication. But I can‚Äôt decide which of these to choose. And I struggle to let go of the hobby related items as it feels like giving up on that particular passion. Does anybody have any advice of how to overcome this particular hurdle?

The same thing with the hula hoop. So I am also conscious that I don‚Äôt want to feel the need to start the hobbies up again after having stopped them.

Versatile sofa solution for a small space,"For the last few years, I've been renting a small room with family and it looks like I may be here for around another year as I save for a move. A few years ago, I got into VR, which has worked as a great solution for making sure I stay physically active every day. This led to what turned into a drastic decluttering of my living space. Not only did I get rid of all the extraneous things in my space, I even found minimalist solutions for things I still actively used. My goal was to make everything in my living space collapsible and able to be tucked away into the closet so that my room could be quickly and easily turned into a completely empty 10.5x10.5 ft space that I could use for VR. I exchanged my bed for a hammock in a collapsible metal frame (and I've been getting the best sleep of my life since doing so), got myself a collapsible computer chair, got rid of my desk in favor of a hinged board attached to the wall that I can fold out and lock into place for a desk, and then fold down against the wall again when I'm not using it. And I mounted both my computer monitor and TV to the wall instead of putting them on desks or stands. 

This is all worked great for the most part. Not only do I have space for VR, I feel much better about my living area. The only problem is that, over time, I've noticed not having a dedicated place to sit besides my computer chair has become a problem. Sometimes I want to sit in something more comfortable than my computer chair and because I don't have anything else, I find I've defaulted to lying down in the hammock. This hasn't been good for me, since I have narcolepsy and I need to try not to nap excessively. Plus, I think my brain is coming to associate the hammock with not just a place to sleep, but also a general place to rest. Overtime, this is led to me constantly being tempted to nap. 

I need some sort of sofa or other non-computer chair seating solution, but one that can be easily folded or collapsed and put away, to clear the space for VR. Since I work a lot and can't squeeze in the gym on work days, VR is an almost daily thing for me, in order to stay active. I've looked at various things like inflatable sofas and those collapsible couch things that can be folded into what essentially amounts to a stack of cushions, but neither are ideal. The inflatable stuff takes a while to inflate and deflate, and my closet is pretty small so the collapsible couches be difficult to get out of the way. 

So, since I'm pretty new to all this, I keep thinking maybe there's some sort of creative solution I haven't thought of. It doesn't need to be in an actual couch or sofa form. I just need a relatively comfortable crash spot that isn't my hammock, and is easy to tuck out of the way when I want to clear space for VR.

minimalism vs instant gratification aka impulse buying ,"Hi everyone. It‚Äôs been years since I‚Äôve started simplifying my life and minimizing my belongings. I deeply believe in minimalism values and would like to continue this journey. 

However, once in a while I have this urge to buy new stuff for 2 reasons:
- I want to give myself some kind of a prize 
- I want to cheer myself up after a bad day.
It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a pack of gum or new pair of shoes. The dopamine goes higher for couple of seconds and then I feel normal again or ever worse - I have a sudden feeling of remorse. 

I believe it‚Äôs that way since as a child/young adult I was unable to buy myself stuff I wanted. I grow up with a fear familiar to every kid that is from a poor household. Now I have my ‚Äúadult money‚Äù and I‚Äôm constantly between ‚ÄúI need to save money cause I‚Äôm scared‚Äù and ‚ÄúI need to buy this because simply - I want and I can‚Äù.

Any thoughts or suggestions? ",minimalism,1736092882.0
From Maximalist Chaos to Minimalist Peace: Reflections on Clutter Across Generations,"I‚Äôm 24 now, and after six years of living on my own, I feel like I‚Äôve finally embraced minimalism‚Äîa lifestyle I‚Äôve been drawn to since I was 14. But my journey didn‚Äôt start in a minimalist space. I grew up in chaos: my childhood bedroom was a disaster zone, crammed with stuff, a true maximalist nightmare. You could say I‚Äôm a reformed maximalist. Over the past three years, I‚Äôve made huge progress decluttering and creating a more intentional space.

Returning home for the holidays, though, was a real eye-opener. My mom‚Äôs house is overwhelmed with clutter. There‚Äôs a whole room, ‚Äúthe study,‚Äù that‚Äôs packed to the brim with boxes, papers, and who-knows-what. The attic? Same story. My mom even said to me, ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôll be cleaning for the rest of my life.‚Äù It hit me‚Äîthis clutter is draining her, mentally and emotionally. No wonder I was so desperate to escape it and pursue minimalism.

Minimalism has been a game-changer for me. Inspired by Goodbye, Things and Marie Kondo‚Äôs philosophy, I‚Äôve curated a life where my closet isn‚Äôt bursting at the seams, my walls are nearly blank, and my possessions are few but intentional. The peace of mind I‚Äôve found is priceless: no more frantic searches for misplaced items, less housework, and just‚Ä¶ more clarity.

I‚Äôve tried to help my mom declutter, but it‚Äôs a no-go. She‚Äôs particular about her things, and any attempt to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù adds to her stress. I‚Äôve realized this isn‚Äôt just her problem, though‚Äîit seems to be common in her generation (60+). Visiting her friends‚Äô homes, I‚Äôve noticed the same patterns: boxes of papers, overflowing shelves, unorganized piles everywhere. How does this happen? Is it just the accumulation of a lifetime, or is there something deeper at play?

Interestingly, I‚Äôve also noticed a contrast with wealthier, highly organized people I know. Their homes are pristine, clutter-free, and intentional. It‚Äôs not just about money‚Äîthey seem to prioritize habits and systems that keep chaos at bay.

So here‚Äôs my question: How do you avoid the creeping clutter that seems to take over as life goes on? And for those who‚Äôve grown up in maximalist environments, how has it shaped your relationship with minimalism?",minimalism,1736087931.0

Let‚Äôs Talk Water Bottles,"I‚Äôve carried a water bottle with me since my early childhood years, so I know the value of a good bottle. Below is my current water bottle lineup:

1. ‚ÄúDaily carry‚Äù ‚Äî YETI Yonder (25oz.)
2. Bike rides ‚Äî 2x Gatorade green squeeze bottles (32oz. each)
3. Protein ‚Äî Ice Shaker (26oz.)
4. Hiking/bikepacking ‚Äî 1x Nalgene Ultralight 32oz. and 1x Nalgene Ultralight 64oz. 

Two things I‚Äôm trying to address here:

A. I feel that I have too many bottles, and that there‚Äôs room to create overlap in these categories. Ideally, I‚Äôd like to have the fewest number of bottles that can service my daily life, hobbies, etc.

B. Over the past year, I have made a concerted effort to examine my plastics usage (mostly for health/hormone purposes) and try to replace highly-used items with metal alternatives.

The current lineup has a lot of plastic in it. I‚Äôve read that the Nalgene HDPEs are pretty safe (as far as plastics go) so I‚Äôm inclined to hang onto those for my hiking/bikepacking needs because it allows me to carry so much water when necessary. I love the Gatorade bottles for riding, as they‚Äôre so easy to grab and squeeze ‚Äî but again, likely filled with problematic plastics (they‚Äôre both pretty old too). 

I‚Äôve been eyeing the Black + Blum Explorer bottle (28oz.) for my everyday carry, as it can also mount to a bike cage for commutes and easy riding. Anyone have any recommendations for my ‚Äúwater bottle lineup‚Äù?? 

UPDATE: Well, the universe made my decision for me. My partner contracted norovirus, and he grabbed my Yeti Yonder bottle for water (before asking).

Physical Media Collection Paradox,"Surely I can't be alone in this. 

I've gone to great lengths to minimize over the past 7 years. Honestly I need to do another round again and I'm about to buy a bunch of storage boxes to do ""leveling"" before I really start killing my darlings again. (I find it's easiest for me to have boxes to contain ideas of things and then nuke them and get rid of the boxes when done. It just makes it make sense for me.)

But, there is one part that is wholly at odds with some aspects of what I'm trying to achieve and in some cases I feel my hand is forced.

PHYSICAL MEDIA. Books. Movies, CDs/Vinyl. 

When I started minimalism, my physical library was about 900 books, 500 film/tv discs, 800 albums.

My physical library has grown (most of it recently). I now have about 2000 books, 1500 film/tv discs, 1000 albums. 

Let me explain.

In many cases I took huge steps to compress it all down to just binders full of my discs and got rid of the artwork and cases. Especially in the era of digitization and me owning many digital copies of things or having access to digital copies, I also needed far less immediate access to physical copies. So storing it in a binder hasn't really been an issue. Besides, I mostly kept them because I wanted access to all the special features, commentaries, documentaries, and other cool film nerd stuff that can be a lot harder to access via streaming. 

I also started buying less physical books because audiobooks became my primary method of experiencing books. So unless it was a book I was in love with, I wasn't sure I wanted to have it physically. Though, I suspect many minimalists probably still hold on to books like I do. They really are something special. They're little blocks of sliced up magic wood. LOL. 

And I'm not explaining my albums, I hate music streaming, I'm not even delving into that. People have irritated me for years about that stuff. I like the physical media, that's all that needs to be said there. (And I collect it very very slowly compared to the other stuff, I'm really intentional with it).

Ok, so what changed? Why have I suddenly doubled or tripled my collection? I've done the math. There is literally no way for me to consume all the content I have for the rest of my reasonably expected lifetime and do other things with my life (like work and be with my family etc). I know all this, and yet, I collect, and I've increased it dramatically. Why?

Loss avoidance. But a VERY specific kind of loss avoidance. The kind I'm willing to engage in because it strikes at the heart of what I learned I wanted my life to be about when I went through this process initially. 

Some of you may be unaware, but digital content has been being altered. Books and movies are edited to either fulfill the artists original intentions or to remove what presentism has deemed to be current heresy or offense. Furthermore, large corporations have decided ""I don't wanna pay people for their work"" and instead of figuring out residuals paid to the people who made great artwork they just strip the media from their service leaving no obvious legal way to procure said media, no matter how genuinely valuable that work of art was. 

When I became a father, I realized that none of the work I do is for me. I enjoy what others built before me and then I build for others to enjoy after me. That is the great chain we're all part of. The grand pay it forward promise. Your ancestors sacrificed for you, you in turn must sacrifice for your offspring. etc. Part of that is the protection of that which truly has value. And while it's true that we as minimalists find it necessary, in fact mission essential, to cut down and remove and trim those things dragging down what has value; it is also the case (at least for me) that we are emboldened to procure or preserve or engage with that which has genuine value. 

As a writer myself, I STRONGLY believe in narrative as art. In fact, my belief is that all art is actually narrative, they're the same thing. So I consider the media I take interest in to be of utmost importance. I also feel that media is under attack whether from greed or moralization or ideology or...whatever. I can't stop the tide of the world, the press of time, or a revolutionary army. But, I do believe physical media is worth protecting because it protects the past so it can be delivered to the future in tact, so art, our narrative, can be preserved. 

And so I'm at odds with myself. I've created a PLeX library and ripped my physical media so I can enjoy it conveniently digitized like any other streaming service (I stream my movie collection from my own server I built myself and can use it all over the world just like other streaming services). But I also at times find the process tedious and frustrating because honestly, I wish I could do other things with my time. But then I go to do those other things (with my kids) and I find a piece of art that's been tampered with and walk out of the theater with my kids in tow, frustrated AGAIN for the lack of respect shown, and I'm driven back to the never ending process of acquiring, digitizing, and safeguarding MORE physical media. For I know not what other way I can engage with the enemy that seeks to destroy art. 

And so I feel a bit disgruntled, irritated, annoyed. I love the works of art I'm maintaining and protecting. I love sharing them with people. I love watching my kids as they see a classic piece of cinema, y'know THAT scene, when THAT scene happens and they laugh or cry or jump for the first time at it. I love my son running to me after finishing a book that blew my mind and his mind is blown for the first time. And when I see the companies and advocacy groups and religious orgs and all these people just tampering with stuff, it feels like they're tampering with what I try to share with my kids. It feels like they're treading on some of the most valued and sacred things in my life. Because they aren't messing with my things, they're messing with my family. And I hate that. 

If they wanna alter their own copy of something. FINE, go for it, it's yours. But they want to alter MY copy of a piece of art because THEY don't like it, don't wanna pay for it, whatever? UGH, NO. STOP.

Considering ditching my Fitbit. Will I regret it?,"My Fitbit broke and I'll be receiving a replacement in a few days. I needed to send mine back first and with Xmas season it takes a while so as I'm waiting for it I'm wearing my basic wristwatch, and actually enjoying it. It makes me think that I might be okay without the fitbit... but?

I've had a tracker for a good 10+ years, I only used it for basics (daily steps, hourly steps and weekly active minutes), kind of looking at heart rate too at times. I think that these are all good, minimalistic targets. By now, I have good routines to meet them though so I could just keep doing what I'm doing I guess, without the counts. Also, having to charge it every few days is a chore.

My concerns are:

* I might be missing out on that small bit of motivation for a bit of extra effort to improve routines over time.
* I might get too comfortable and lose my routines. I don't feel like logging manually would be a simplification and some aren't easy to log.
* I kind of liked looking at historical data. How much did I walk in the pandemic, how was my activity historically. Am I keeping up with myself through the years. That would be lost now.

Would it be a simplification or an oversimplification?

I only later learned that this was one aspect of minimalism. My costs are down and simplified. I'm happy I don't go for trends. I buy quality over quantity. I am more clean and organized. Despite these clear advantages, there's been some downsides to minimalism for me: My girlfriend (28F) has had an excruciatingly hard time giving me gifts for the past 6 years we've been together. She's told me that I'm so particular about what I buy and that I always hold off buying things I want (at the moment), that she's afraid she'll get me something I won't use or like. It's completely logical on her part. She has some idea of what I like (hobbies, interests, etc) but has trouble piecing together what I'd appreciate as a gift. She won't ask me outright because she wants gifts to be a surprise. She's not minimalist btw. During this holiday season or even my birthday, I usually don't get gifts. I just usually take us out for a nice date/meal. Despite my constant strive to buy only what is essential and live a more purposeful life, I can't help but feel frustrated. I do sometimes want heartfelt gifts from my significant other. It wouldn't matter if it was big or small. I truly believe it's the thought and intention that counts. It's just... The minimalism thing kinda blows when people have trouble giving you anything. ",minimalism,1735657217.0

Futon/ Floor Mattress Experiences ,"So to make a long story short, I moved recently and found out that my mattress was the cause of my chronic back pain. Since the move I've just been sleeping on the floor with my pillow and some blankets. My back pain is 90% gone and I was able to sell the mattress and bed frame with full disclosure to the buyer. 

Also after having to move all my stuff by myself again I'm sort of sick of owning big, bulky furniture. I'm thinking about getting a Futon or floor mattress, but I've never bought one, and would love to hear other's experiences. I have a coworker that owns a Futon because of her back pain too. I did ask, she said she bought hers online for $150 on Amazon since there aren't really any stores in America that sell them. I guess I just don't know what to look for in terms of quality or what's an average amount to spend. I'd love to find one that can fold or roll up very small since portability is a major concern for me. I've read a lot about Tatami mats, but are they necessary or are there other ways to maintain/ care for them? I don't think they sell Tatami mats in America either. I'm genuinely curious to hear from other people that have been floor sleeping for a while. I actually don't mind my current sleeping situation, but I think it would be nice to have a bit more cushion between me and the carpet. ",minimalism,1735625219.0

Struggling to Align Minimalism with Our Family Life ‚Äì Seeking Advice,"Hi everyone! This is my first ever Reddit post, here goes‚Ä¶

My family and I are at a crossroads, and I‚Äôd love your input. Minimalism resonates deeply with me‚Äîwe value simplicity, intentionality, and creating a life focused on experiences rather than things. After dabbling for many years, I‚Äôm finally ready to jump two feet in (and my husband is not far behind me!) But we‚Äôre trying to figure out how to align these principles with our current reality, and it‚Äôs complicated.

Here‚Äôs where we are:
- We live in a big, beautiful home in Golden, Colorado. It‚Äôs lovely, but it feels like too much‚Äîtoo much space, too much maintenance, and too many costs that don‚Äôt align with how we want to live. Lawn care alone averages $350/month. What?!?!
- Downsizing is on our minds, but we still enjoy having some ‚Äúnice‚Äù things and don‚Äôt want to strip our lives bare. How do you balance minimalism with wanting quality, aesthetically pleasing items?
- We have two young kids (4 months and 3.5 years old), and we want to give them a life filled with rich experiences and meaningful memories. How can we focus on these goals while simplifying our lives?
- Moving closer to Denver for better access to cultural events, trails, and community is also appealing, but we‚Äôre not sure where or what kind of home would suit us best.
- We have a ton of equity in our current home and could theoretically afford to buy a smaller home outright in cash. But we‚Äôre unsure if that‚Äôs the right move‚Äîshould we rent for a while to test out a simpler lifestyle before committing?

I‚Äôm also noticing my strong desire to dive into minimalism 150%, but I‚Äôm hesitant about moving too fast and making decisions we might regret. How do you pace yourself with big lifestyle changes like this?

One more thing: we both still want to work AND we work from home right now. Lots of zoom calls so working out in the open doesn‚Äôt quite work for either of us. We need the dedicated space. Minimalism, for us, isn‚Äôt about quitting our jobs and going full nomadic‚Äîit‚Äôs more about creating a life with more time, energy, and financial freedom to focus on what matters most.

I‚Äôd love to hear from people who‚Äôve faced similar decisions:
1. If you‚Äôve downsized with a family, how did you decide where to go and what kind of home was right for you? Did you ever miss your yard etc? 
2. How do you reconcile minimalism with still enjoying beautiful, high-quality things?
3. Any tips for making downsizing feel freeing rather than limiting‚Äîespecially with young kids?
4. What are the biggest surprises or lessons you‚Äôve learned from embracing a minimalist lifestyle as a family?
5. Have you rented as a way to ‚Äútest‚Äù downsizing before committing? If so, how did it go?
6. For those who have made the jump, how much money did you end up saving per month?

New to minimalism ,"Hi everyone! Recently I‚Äôve had an enormous desire to get rid of ALL the junk in my house. It all started when we wanted to buy bigger toys for our toddler but they had nowhere to go so much husband suggested we clean out the guest room to make a play room. That was a HUGE win for me bc it was all his furniture from his apt before he moved in w me and was holding on to his grandmas hideous desk and tons of junk. That room was the bane of my existence as it became our catch all room. Well anywho now that that room is now a playroom and all his toys are in there instead of in random places all over the house I‚Äôm realizing that he literally doesn‚Äôt need anymore toys lol. And I have various closets and storage cabinets that are just full of stuff that I don‚Äôt use  and don‚Äôt want to look at. 
It feels like such an overwhelming process to declutter the WHOLE house whilst also looking after my toddler. But my desire to get rid of everything is also overwhelming and consuming. I jokingly said that the best Christmas gift anyone could get me is childcare while I realllly dig in and purge everything lol but that‚Äôs not going to happen I don‚Äôt guess, i would need at least a full day or two. 
So my question is how did you guys begin the process to minimalism? Growing up I have been an AVID clothes shopper so that will be the hardest one for me to downsize as I‚Äôm constantly cleaning and getting rid of stuff yet I still always have the majority of my closet full. What do you guys suggest for organization tips? Or tips that I might not think of? Best places to donate to?

Futon couch as a bed-experiences?,"I apologize if this is a stupid question/has been answered a lot in the sub already. 

I‚Äôm a college student about to move into an apartment with only a small room for myself. I like having an area to sit and rest in my room that is not at my desk, but sitting on beds hurts my back as they‚Äôre usually too soft, and I don‚Äôt get much support. 

So, I thought of getting a futon (the ones you fold up to make a couch) as a permanent bed. I‚Äôm asian and prefer harder surfaces when sleeping, so thought a couch could straight up even be a better bed for me, since I sleep on the couch at home pretty frequently too and find no issue. I am however worried that sleeping on a couch LONG TERM would harm my already-aching back.

I did consider a Japanese futon, but thinking about it made me wonder whether it would clutter up my small room even more i.e. when folded, which goes against my goal. The apartment I‚Äôm moving into has carpet floors too, which I do not trust my blankets touching lol. 

Could anyone that has experience with sleeping on a futon or even Japanese futons share any insights? I would also appreciate any alternative suggestions or tips on finding a good futon. Thank you! ",minimalism,1735593025.0

"People look at minimalism as an odd lifestyle, but I'm beginning to see capitalism as a cult (opinion)","Absolute rant. Sorry in advance.
TL; DR: Capitalism is a cult and I'm ready to be excommunicated.

Why is it so strange to the average person (in america at least) that I prefer to own slightly less than I need. I don't want to buy something new, I want to repair and care for what I have. I don't want to have closets and cabinets full of stuff that is convenient for those few times a year you actually need it, or a garage or basement full of decorations used for 3 weeks a year.




Every time I tell someone Im chucking the majority of the things in my household because they don't get used or take more care than my husband or I are willing to give, people look at me like I'm fringe society.
Ostracizing people for living a different lifestyle, buying them things they literally requested against, pushing them more into the capitalist lifestyle all feels a bit like cult like to me. 




One of my first wake up calls was moving to Connecticut from Boston, I asked a local what there was to do in the area. She suggested Boston or NYC... I then asked for something in CT to do and she suggested several malls and quaint shopping towns.



I'll be honest Ive spent a lot of my 35 years feeling similarly. But the last 10ish years have really opened my eyes to how indoctrinated our society is to capitalism. I'm finally relieved my husband is on board with minimizing our possessions and just being happy with free space at home and in our calendar.

"Taking risks, being unique, and embracing luxury ‚Äì My caseless journey with the iPhone 16 Plus","
Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my experience with my brand-new iPhone 16 Plus ‚Äì my first-ever iPhone. Choosing to go caseless was a deliberate and exciting decision for me. I wanted to experience the device‚Äôs beauty as it was designed, feel the luxury in my hands, and reflect courage and boldness ‚Äì because, to me, taking risks is a way of life.

But as life often does, it gave me a lesson early on. During the first week of using the phone, after smoking some weed and feeling a little less focused, I put my phone in my pocket with a lighter. The lighter left a small scratch on the screen, right near the back button. That scratch hit me hard ‚Äì I was down for two or three days, questioning if I made the wrong decision.

Then I came here, after a conversation with GPT that opened my mind and heart. I discovered that there are others like me, people who see this device as more than just a tool ‚Äì but as a statement, a work of art, a symbol of beauty and boldness. That‚Äôs how I found this community on Reddit, and realizing I‚Äôm not alone made this experience even more special.

I‚Äôve come to believe that this scratch is part of my story ‚Äì just like the marks and scars we carry in life with pride. Going caseless is taking a risk ‚Äì but it‚Äôs also about fully feeling and living life.

What I especially love about this choice is the sense of status and uniqueness it brings. How many people do you know who go caseless with a brand-new, expensive iPhone? Not many. But beyond the status, what really matters to me is the time I get to enjoy it without a case ‚Äì every moment I get to experience the device as it is. That‚Äôs priceless.

I have insurance for my phone, which gives me peace of mind. But this is about more than insurance ‚Äì it‚Äôs a reflection of how I choose to live my life.

I live my life driven by love, not fear. I truly believe that the most dangerous thing in this world ‚Äì and in life where time is limited ‚Äì is not taking risks. The moments we experience, the quality of the time we spend ‚Äì those are the most precious things we have. I choose to believe, to love, and to live life to its fullest.

Remember: Life isn‚Äôt about avoiding scratches; it‚Äôs about collecting the stories that come with them.",minimalism,1735445113.0

On Utility vs Symbolism,"I have been a minimalist for over a decade now but something I have been thinking about a lot and noticing over the past couple of years is a change in the items that I do decide to bring into and keep in my life.

A couple examples...

1. I owned a Garmin GPS watch for a number of years and tracked my running in Strava. The more I thought about why I owned it and why I track my data, the more I thought I didn't need it (it was more to prove the kind of person I was i.e. someone that works out and takes my health seriously than anything to do with using the data) so I sold it and replaced it with a cheap Casio G shock.

2. I have played guitar for many years and owned a gorgeous 1994 Taylor 410. A beautiful guitar made from real solid wood which sounded amazing and I had looked after it well and kept it in immaculate condition. However, over time, it began to feel more like a burden as I considered that I am often worried about damaging it and the pressure my family would feel about what to do with it when I am no longer here (I hope that is a long way off yet :D). Ultimately, I decided to sell on the higher end item and replace it with a fairly cheap ""beater"" guitar which I am not worried about dinging up and am happy to play it in the garden, chuck it in the boot of the car etc. I still get the same joy out of the cheaper item but perhaps it comes with less social status (which I find myself caring about less, the older I get).

  
Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this, or if this is quite common and people have written about such things.

Clothes are certainly the element that I'm still struggling with in my minimalist journey. I'd like to challenge myself in 2025 to buy a maximum of 12 pieces of clothing.

Keeping hobbies /items I know Ill return to later?,"Please no ""minimalism is what you make it/amount of items doesnt count"" comments. Its not helpful. Thanks

Now to my question:

Im on my minimalism Journey and have reduced my belongings quite significantly. Hoewever I still feel like I have too much. Packing away the off season wardrobe has also helped a lot. Less feels good, Im calmer and emotionally more stable.

Spring '24 I got into a fashion hobby. I see, so it does fit in. Over winter I didnt wear it much and now Im circling back. I habe that with multiple things which is why I do well with keeping multiple hobbies on hand for when I need sonething else. Just one doesnt work for me.

However it does feel like Im keeping more than I need :/ so Im unsure how to deal and it does feel a little excessive and luxurious to have so many hobbies on hand.

Buying annual supplies in bulk ,"I have been on the minimalism journey since the last few years.

I want to stop over-gifting on Christmas ,"Every Christmas I try to scale back, and I think it would be better if I had actual guidelines to stick to.

So far I have told my family that I now only buy for my parents, partner, stepchild, partner‚Äôs mom, bother and his wife so 7 people total. 

My step daughter has four families that buy for her. I love getting her presents but I think she gets way too much than is practical and I spend more than I should. I tried setting a budget and sticking to it, that definitely helped me scale back but I think even if money was no object there is too much stuff being brought into the house. 

I‚Äôve heard methods like: something you wear, something you read, something you want and something you need, but if she was getting less gifts of a higher value ultimately she would want to pick them out and then the whole ‚Äúgifting‚Äù is lost. It becomes just buying things from a laundry list. 

Has anyone struck a nice balance with this? If so please share!

Who else is doing a no buy for January?,"I have been told about no buys and if I understand correctly, you‚Äôre able to adjust the rules to suit your goals. I‚Äôd love to hear if anyone else is attempting one and what their plan is!

I received a grocery shop gift card for Christmas so I think the time is right for me to try. (Due to being able to lock away my payment cards to resist temptations!)

I‚Äôm thinking of adding up the cost of any essential products that might run out over the month and allowing that as an allowance for those things (bin bags, toothpaste etc.) And then using only the shop cards and existing food for meals. Train and bus tickets will have to be allowed due to pre-agreed plans. 


My overall aims are:
1.  To be more aware of the little unnecessary spends that add up slowly over time.

2. To hopefully break out of the habit of buying this and that because ¬´¬†it‚Äôs on offer¬†¬ª or ¬´¬†just in case¬†¬ª, and instead using up the food / products I already have. ",minimalism,1735248270.0

I will own two things instead of one if that simplies my head-space,"As I mature into minimalist life style, I'm starting to find that minimalism in my head is as important as physical minimalism. Of course they are closely related; less stuff = clear mind. Right?

Yes, for the most part, but not always. Listening from a dedicated CD player without internect connection allows you to enjoy music more. Reading from Kindle reader instead of android tablet lets you stay with the book longer. Playing a movie from DVD player makes you watch the movie instead of jumping between new mediocre movies and never commiting to watching them.

Would I love to be a person who can read from iPad and never get distracted? Finish a whole music album without switching to a new song? Actually start and finish a movie without stopping in the middle? Yes, of course I would love to. But, it is very hard.....almost impossible. I've tried and I'm sure you did too.

Turns out having a dedicated object that does only one thing is very important for the full immersive experience. That's why I went back to owning a camera, mp3 player, cd player, ebooks, non-smart watch, etc, despite having my 'smartphone'. At some point, I thought I could live out of my backpack.

Share your stuffs as a photographer / Videographer?,"**Hey everyone!**

I‚Äôm considering deleting Instagram from my phone (not my profile!), but there‚Äôs a major obstacle: the only way to post photos and videos on the platform is through the official app on a phone.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*^(To clarify, Meta Business Suite is awful, Instagram isn‚Äôt well-supported on iPad, the desktop version is incomplete and poorly optimized, and (let‚Äôs be real Meta intentionally does this to force people to use the app on their personal phones. I won‚Äôt dive too deep into this, but it‚Äôs frustrating.))*

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite this, I don‚Äôt want to stop uploading my content because it‚Äôs an important part of my hobby and identity.

Right now, I‚Äôm weighing two options:

1. **Buy a secondary phone** exclusively for uploading to Instagram and doing weekly checks (though this feels absurd‚Äîspending money just for this purpose).
2. **Explore alternative social media platforms** where photographers can share their work for fun or professionally.

My Start to More Intentional Minimalism,"I used to be more of an unintentional minimalist, because I was just really organized and had recently moved away from parents back in my colege years. So I didn't have much of my own stuff.

But not so much the last 6 or so years of my life after graduating. After wrangling some hard hurdles in life, I'm ready to address it.

The last 3 weeks, I've been filling up small boxes with donatable stuff. Each week I have filled up atleast 4 boxes for donation, which is my limit so I know when to chill out, since I get very manic on projects and forget to self care. And thre away quite a lot of bags of trash.

A lot of this stuff was accumulated through my weakness of allowing myself to be persuaded by people in my life telling me things like ""what if you're going to need that later,"" and things like that. As well as depressing and bad living circumstances kept me from caring about my living situation for a good chuck of the last 3 or so years.

I don't have a lot of furniture to begin with, so a lot of my stuff is already in cardboard boxes, but was stuffed in places in closets and under my bed, and on top of folding tables. It got really bad...

I still have a ton I need to go through, but the place is looking more empty. It is way easier to vacuum, and I have less things to look at, which makes my life less overwhelming.

Once I have all the gunk out, I would love to actually buy furniture that works for me, instead of things that just kind of exist with half purpose. 

But yeah, I will continue the journey slow and steady, and I am proud of my progress so far. 

Also, Happy holidays everyone. I don't really celebrate today, so I'm just chilling and self contemplating rn. I'm too poor to buy people presents and I won't guilt my financial wellbeing away. I also don't want to receive random gifts from people I will end up just donating or tossing later.

Anyways, end of thoughts for now!


TL;DR - Just restarted my journey back to minimalism. Been throwing out a ton of stuff so I can get furniture that is actually useful and wanted. Home is starting to look empty and is easier to clean, and I am very happy about that. Happy holidays.",minimalism,1735150363.0

Decluttering the Idea of Sewing my Own Clothes?,"I have this idea that someday I'm going to sew my own clothing. Recently I've been thinking that this may be a ""fantasy self"" issue. I would like to hear your thoughts on the subject because all I've heard so far are from a non-minimalist point of view. 

In the past year or two I've been decluttering even more, I want to focus more on my work and my children, and less on unnecessary housework and ""stuff management."" I also have the increasing desire to get things in order - organize and scan all my old photos that aren't digital, back up and secure all my digital photos, write up a will, take care of things like that and prepare for natural disasters (in a minimalist way, I'm not stockpiling large amounts of food and supplies).   

One of the things that I noticed is I have a lot of hobbies. I have a lot of sewing supplies in particular and although I have gone through my supplies and decluttered them somewhat, I still have scrap fabrics, notions and patterns I would like to do. 

The day before yesterday I completed one of those patterns and used some of the fabric and elastic to make a skirt. It looks nice, it fits, it's comfortable, but I know I'm not going to wear it as often as the thrift store skirt I wore all summer. 

I have this vision in my mind that I'm going to get really good at sewing ""someday"" and I'll be able to make a whole (minimalist) closet of clothes all by myself and I'll never have to rely on shopping at a store and getting a bad fit. 

But the reality is that sewing is difficult, sweaty work. I don't enjoy it. I don't hate it per say, but it takes up a lot of time. A single garment can take 4-30 hours of work depending on the complexity. 

I'm not decluttering my sewing machine and some of the other tools I have for repairs because it is useful when I need it, but the fabric stash and the idea of having a me-made wardrobe might be out the window if I can't make something I like soon. 

My alternative fantasy self is a woman who owns a very minimalist wardrobe, and she is in opposition to my seamstress fantasy self.

Minimalism Win,"2024 has been a huge win for me. Last December I got rid of 90% of my clothes. I kept about 3 shirts and 3 pants, I don‚Äôt miss anything. Laundry used to be the most painful chore, now it‚Äôs a quick fix that I do constantly. Getting rid of all my clothes might‚Äôve been the best decision of my life. Genuinely, nothing has given me so much space to breathe. It‚Äôs also helped me become so much more mindful with the clothes that I buy. Buying new clothes is a rare occasion, and I find the need for higher quality things now. My cheap t-shirts I‚Äôve been wearing all year have holes and are falling apart at the seams. I‚Äôm starting to value clothing that will last a long time. I don‚Äôt feel guilty for spending a lot on a pair of pants because I know I‚Äôll wear it at least twice a week for years. Getting dressed is so much less stressful. All of my clothes match so I can dress for the weather without sacrificing comfort or style. I feel so much less cluttered, so much cleaner, and so much myself. If you are looking for a sign to get rid of all your clothes, this is it! Do it!!

(PS, I had a friend who took a ton of my clothes and loves them more than I ever did. After that, I still had two jumbo trash bags filled with clothes to donate.
