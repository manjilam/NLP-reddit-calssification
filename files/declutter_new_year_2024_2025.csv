I wish I never bought it,"I used to LOVE buying seemingly useful things, then all the sudden in my late 20s I had this sudden constant desire to own nothing and become semi minimalist. It‚Äôs been over 2 years and that desire has only gotten stronger by the day.

I have a lot of mental health issues and find any clutter makes it worse. My house looks very clean, clutter free, and ‚Äúminimalist‚Äù to the average visitor but what they don‚Äôt see is my drawers, closets, under bed, and cabinets stuffed to the brim with ‚Äústuff‚Äù. Also my garage that I can barely fit in because it has over 30 boxes that I have still not unpacked from when I moved in 4 years ago. 

I acquired more things than most people have in a life time. Why did I buy every kitchen aid appliance? Every possible cake decoration and type of baking equipment? Etc over 15 bins of Halloween/Christmas decor? WHY?!? Why do I own 2 gorgeous life sized skeletons? I have so many quality items. All this stuff is not junk, it‚Äôs useful‚Ä¶ how am I supposed to get rid of it? I don‚Äôt need it, but I don‚Äôt want to get rid of it either. I just wish I never bought it. 

The only thing I have going for me is that haven‚Äôt bought a single non consumable (aside from clothes, I don‚Äôt have an issue with over buying clothes) in a few years now. NOTHING more comes into my house. It only goes out. Stuff is a burden to me, I despise stuff ",declutter,1743484049.0
Decluttering basement,What to keep and what to throw away? Do people keep their grandma's old clothes as memories? How about mom's? I've had them for about 15 years since both passes away and only keep them because it would be nice to have them to reminisce in the future but I haven't look at them in 15 years already. Maybe it feel like losing another memory or part of them? It feels kind of silly to keep this stuff as it takes space which causes me anxiety. Should I keep only 1 bin of the important items and re evaluate later? What would you do? ,declutter,1743478009.0
Have you ever considered donating stuff that has value because it‚Äôs easier and less overwhelming than selling? (Question for people who are low to medium income),"I have so much stuff I‚Äôm holding onto to ‚Äúsell‚Äù but I haven‚Äôt sold yet.. it‚Äôs been years of me still not selling due to laziness or overwhelm or lack of energy‚Ä¶ not really sure what it is. Lots of times I think I should just donate it, but at the same time I know I can get $20-$100 per item and because I could use the money I hold onto it to sell (but then don‚Äôt).

Usually when I read advice around this people say anything worth over $20 they sell but I just never end up getting around to selling it. If I had lot of money I would just donate it all, however my biggest hang up is around money ‚ÄúI‚Äôm short on money and should probably sell this instead of donating‚Äù but truthfully I just wish it was gone. 

All together I probably have about $1,500 worth of stuff I could sell but like I said I just don‚Äôt (I have chronic mental and physical health issues that make it difficult and also I just find it distressful selling stuff and easier to just put it in a bag and donate).

It‚Äôs just hard for me to justify doing that when I could use that $1,500

It stresses me out so much. I constantly think to myself ‚ÄúI wish I was rich so these items had no monetary value to me so I could just get rid of them with no thought‚Äù and ‚Äúthat way even if I got rid of something I ended up wanting I could just buy it again‚Äù. 

I hate how much stuff I have in my home, I want to get rid of it so bad!!! I just know if I get rid of it I won‚Äôt be able to afford to buy it again. 

I need advice and support

How do you go about finding the right place to give away the non garbage things as you declutter?,"Maybe someone can also relate, but I have a much easier time saying bye to things that don‚Äôt fit in my life anymore if I know it‚Äôs actually going somewhere that it‚Äôs likely to find a new life and not just get thrown out.

What's the balance of keeping stuff you will rarely use?,"Hi everyone, mom of two toddlers and we're planning to move cross country in about 6 months. I want to make our move as easy and possible by getting rid of some stuff, but the balance of what to get rid of is hard to figure out for me. For instance, I have things like platters/charceuterie boards/vases/etc that I don't use often, but I know I'll use for years for holidays and parties. Do I designate one box to these items and whatever doesn't fit goes? Or just keep them all knowing I will use them? Or get rid of most and keep my favorites? Another one is a cake decorating kit. I plan to use it at least for my children's birthdays every year, but I could get rid of it and just improvise (and maybe be less satisfied with the end results).

In the middle of decluttering and reorganizing‚Ä¶ question.,"How do you get rid of items that sit and take up space but are either brand new and spent money on?

Simultaneously big and small win: old school work!,"(TL;DR below)

Hey everyone! I found this subreddit during an ‚Äòoh no please tell me other people struggle with this‚Äô moment and instantly found it a great community! So hey everyone!

Anyway, I had a simultaneously HUGE and small win recently, and wanted to share in case others might find it useful: old school stuff.

Some context: I have basically sought after a certain career path my entire life, which is immensely visible in my school books‚Ä¶ so when I was forced to get rid of a load of them it felt TRICKY. Like‚Ä¶ REALLY hard. My career goals are also heavily academic so I was convinced for years that all my school work would and will be relevant. So I had about 6 large boxes‚Äô worth of virtually EVERYTHING ‚Äì artwork from when I was 3, practice exams, almost every workbook ever, and all sorts of bits and pieces otherwise. Brochures and souvenirs from school trips, and, believe it or not, even some school clothes in a big bag which, of course, do not fit me at all now. There was a LOT. 

So to find a way to declutter massively into just one box, we whittled it down to 2 general things: 
A) School reports, prizes, awards, qualifications (ie anything with a sort of ‚Äòobvious achievement or progress‚Äô)
B) Mementos that are a nice reminder of the school community/experience, such as class photos, programmes or brochures from theatre trips or trips abroad (provided we‚Äôd gone there and done that activity whilst on the trip), and any small keepsakes that people had written in.

‚Ä¶and I was CONVINCED, seeing the stash of textbooks, loose bits of work, past papers, anything and everything that was just ‚Äústuff I had done whilst at school‚Äù just disappear into the ether, that I would REALLY STRUGGLE.

But once it was there and gone‚Ä¶ it really wasn‚Äôt that difficult to get out of sight, out of mind? Sure, it was a bit of a shame but it was also an incredibly comforting way to go ‚ÄúI have things from school which can remind me of the growing up experience, but I don‚Äôt have EVERYTHING to keep reminiscing with and not wanting to grow up any more‚Äù. So that was the small (but personally fairly big win)!!

However the HUGE win is also that discovering how ‚Äònothing-y‚Äô the feeling of getting rid of so much of this was, has been making many other stages of the decluttering WAY easier. There are a plethora of childhood things that I‚Äôve had in case it will come in useful ‚Äî but if it hasn‚Äôt become useful to me from leaving school until now, my mid-20s, then it‚Äôs unlikely that it will be immensely crucial any time hereafter.

So I have no clue if this will help anyone in any way, but hopefully it will! If you‚Äôre holding onto things from childhood that are just ‚Äòthere‚Äô, it genuinely might be easier than you think to whittle it down!!

TL;DR: I had REALLY struggled to get rid of all my school things for years, and after whittling it all down to only the ‚Äòimportant‚Äô souvenirs, the whole feeling and act of moving on became WAY easier than I had anticipated for years. ",declutter,1743278536.0
a HUGE win for me: I started decluttering my stuffed animals!,"sorry this is kind of long, but i feel like i need to tell it all in its entirety. tl;dr at the end!  
I always had a very close attachment to my stuffed animals. they were something my sister and i bonded with and took great care of. i always thought i'd pass them down to my future children (and, when i personally chose not to have kids, my sister's future kids). i considered them a big part of me!  
i've been living with my father for a little, and i'm signing a lease for a place about 100 miles away. now is the perfect time to downsize things i didn't get the chance to before. that also means getting a new job. i'm a substitute teacher working for a very small school for self-contained special education, ages 4-21. we have a couple hundred kids in that entire age range, and i've grown very close to them all over these years (especially after having taught them all at least once in the past!). they truly have made me a better person, and same vice versa, and i love them all with my entire heart. because i'm a sub, i work very closely with pretty much every teacher in the building. so while moving away is a huge, important step for me, i will miss them all dearly.  
then one day it just clicked: i need these kids to have my old stuffed animals! it's perfect! i asked my one coworker (who's become one of my closest friends over the years), and she said it sounds perfect. i take a little box over of ones i'm not so attached to, and the kids LOVED them! one teacher sent me a picture of one sat next to a kid for breakfast. it made my heart melt seeing the kids enjoy what brought me so much joy in the past!  
don't get me wrong, some are still a little too sentimental, and that's okay. i can keep some as a treat. however, now i'm excited to get another little box together and take it to the kids. i look at them like ""omg this kid would love this! this is abc's favorite animal! this is perfect for this room or this kid!"" it's brought me so much joy. box #2 goes out this week and i'll keep going until i'm down to a far smaller collection.  
tl;dr i'm a teacher who's moving and i'm giving away my collection to my students. it's really rewarding.",declutter,1743266007.0

Friday 15: Bottom 10%!,"Choose a subcategory of craft, art, or hobby gear that makes you feel overwhelmed. You're not going to tackle a whole room here! Pick a subset that is about the quantity you can spread out on a table. (So if you have 5000 pieces of scrapbook paper, take only the green ones. Or if they're not sorted by color, just grab a chunk of the pile.)

Trusting your gut, remove the items you like *least.* These are the things where, if you had tons of free time and creative energy, you still wouldn't get around to using them. I refer to this as the ""bottom 10%"" because that's a handy number -- sometimes it's less and sometimes it's a lot more. (If you don't immediately feel ""I like this one so much less than the rest!"", then either your stash is a good size or this is the wrong decluttering technique for you.)

The sub's [Donation Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/wiki/index/donation_guide/) includes places that want art supplies! Don't beat yourself up for having excess stash, but *do* look for patterns in what you buy when maybe you shouldn't.

"""I'll keep it.

This extra room has so many possibilities - an office, kids room, or guest area. Why when we live in a home do we devalue our space by filling closets, drawers & sometimes even whole rooms - with items we do not use? 

Let's imagine a closet filled entirely to the brim making it impossible to find stuff or function in the space. It's almost as if this room has now been downgraded to a room without a closet - I'm sure if you saw a room without a closet when you were first looking at the home you would make a mental note or question if there was enough storage.

Letters from cousin - throw away or post back to her?,"I am doing a further round of decluttering on my boxes of kept birthday cards, letters etc from family and friends.

However, even since then she barely made any effort with me.

50 year old knitted baby blanket,"A few years ago my mom downsized to a senior living apartment and gave me a bunch of stuff she had been saving.

Got rid of old devices today!,"Small victory to share!  
I'm so proud of myself that I finally got rid of bunch of old devices today!!

I dropped off at near by Apple Store:   
2-3 old phones (not even smartphones that I used more than 15 years ago), 1 ancient iPod, 1 Apple Watch series 2, and 1 laptop (kind of broken).   
I was able to factory reset only my laptop and the rest, I lost chargers long time ago and don't know if I wiped it before they died or not. And that made me procrastinate to recycle for soooo long.   
But finally I put everything in a box and showed them to Apple Store staff, and he kindly took everything. Took me less than 3 min. He asked if I need a receipt but I just declined. I don't think it valued anything.  
If there were, you probably gets in-store credit or something. I don't know. Please do your own research if you are interested in.

I was scared of data bleaching but after getting rid of them, I don't care anymore.  
I'm just happy to be able to get this done.

Not sure if I should keep or get rid and get rid of more,"So I've recently been trying to minimalise my home, I've been successful at downsizing most  categories. I'm down to the last few things and I've been going back over rooms to ensure I'm only keeping what we really need, will use, or enjoy.
I've managed to halve the amount of items we have and even have rethought about ""essentials"" such as an ironing board and a toaster that we never use.

I have 2 ornaments that my mum gifted me and my partner when we moved into our home, and we had them on display for 5 years.
They have designs on them that represent our names and they're really ""cool"", also represent the city we live in. It was a great gift at the time.

However, I'm considering getting rid of them because for the last 2 years they've only sat in a drawer and I have no intention of bringing them out again as our taste has changed. Although I'm also of two minds I could bring them out again someday...

But if I get rid of them, I'm now thinking I should get rid of a display vase I've got as it is ""not deserving enough"" to take up space if these gifts couldn't take up space. I find myself thinking IF I get rid of this item, then my threshold changes and more things got to go.

Hope that makes sense?

Taking my time to make sure it's right this time.,"The saga of the wardrobe that fought back continues. Over the weekend we put in new shelves and reinforced rail and I did the worst paint job ever (although no-one will see it and it's much brighter and cleaner than it was!)

I've been gradually clearing up the chaos that was the house because the wardrobe stuff was everywhere. It has been so tempting to get rid of some of the obvious things and then just stick it all back in there, close the door, job done. However, I decided I'd do it properly. Nothing is going back behind those doors without consideration. Nothing is going back behind those doors in a nice, neat storage container of any description that simply masks what's in there. As a result, I'm on day three of Operation 'How did it all fit in there in the first place?' üòÇ

So far, I've put out three bags for the binmen and have five full bags to donate. I'm happy with the stuff that has made it back onto the rails - things that have been bypassed each time I've decluttered that still haven't been worn (indeed still have tags on) are gone and I absolutely know that I won't miss them. 

I've also had what I consider to be a major win with his shirts. The wardrobe didn't only contain my stuff. I know I have too much but so does he! He insisted on hanging every shirt he owns and that only added to the strain on that poor rail. He hasn't sorted any of his stuff for a long time and is more reluctant to do so than I will ever be. When I emptied the wardrobe after it collapsed, I took all of his shirts off the hangers. I've not only persuaded him to go through them at the weekend, but in addition he's agreed that the shirts can be folded rather than hung (I always end up ironing them before he wears them anyway). We've measured up and I've found some drawers that will fit inside perfectly and I'm so excited that the space won't be so stuffed - I've even found room to store the 4 pairs of bridesmaid shoes that I've bought in prep for our wedding later this year! 

All in all, I'm quite glad that the wardrobe made this decision for me and I'm giving it the proper time and attention that it actually deserves. My mind is already feeling so much calmer every time I walk in the room and I'm not quite finished yet.

The art of decluttering,"Hello there,

I am trying to declutter my flat since years but I never really make any progress.  
Maybe a little more background information to me is required.

I grew up in a hoarder like household, the exact circumstances are not important but that was my childhood ever since the death of my mum and me being on my own overnight basically.  
I am not a hoarder, I think, I can throw away stuff and don't hoard stuff but I find it incredibly hard to keep my place tidy and organised. Not just my place, my life too, stuff like paperwork for example.  
I have no concept of tidiness and organisation.   
Funnily enough, I have an easier time at work doing that, maybe because everything has its predetermined place there.

When I start decluttering, I get sidetracked and overwhelmed very easily, in the end I try to do everything at once and that just stresses me out and I give up.

Do you have some tips for me maybe, strategies or approaches?",declutter,1743002536.0
3 days+ and still failing,"Hi.
New to the group and I'm hoping to get inspiration and advice from posts in here.
Over the last couple of weeks on random days of work plus the last three days I have been trying to declutter my spare bedroom but also reduce some of the stuff in the loft which I admit I should have stuck to one room at a time but I was in that zone. I am getting rid of loads and loads of stuff and take into the rubbish tip but I still seem to have loads of stuff. I'm not talking to a hoarders sort of extent I'm just talking lots of little knick knacks and unnecessary things. It can be a bit demotivating when you have worked for hours and produced quite a few bags of junk but they're still stuff left. 
How do you guys steam motivated in doing the decluttering. I know it's best to do one room at a time to avoid being overwhelmed but apart from that. ",declutter,1742998740.0
"Question about ""where would I look for this item""","I'm a fan of Dana K White's decluttering books and methods, and a lot of what she says really clicks for me.

But I really struggle with one part especially: ""Where would I look for this item?"" 

For most of the items in my house that are clutter, the issue is that they don't have an instinctive place where they live. For example, I have a hanging mesh herb drying rack-- I would probably look for this in a pantry (near the herbs and spices), or near gardening supplies (in a garage or shed? idk I don't have either one). My pantry is too small to fit the drying rack. So where I would look for it would be... wherever I decide to put it! But I don't have space! 

Another example is my sewing supplies. They currently sit messily on a few different shelves, not next to each other. I would LOVE to have one shelf dedicated to all of them. But all the shelving in my place is too small to fit my sewing machine, box with thred/scissors/etc, and box of projects. 

How do those of you living in small spaces implement the ""Where would I look for this item?"" step?",declutter,1742994463.0
I want to throw things away but I feel guilty,"So I've been slowly decluttering for the past month. I live in a small 2 bed condo with my partner and our two kids. We're preparing for an eventual move sometime this year which is what kickstarted this round of decluttering. 

I feel like I've been making some good progress but one place that I keep getting stuck is that I feel really guilty about throwing things away. I've donated the majority of what I've decluttered to thrift stores and have made peace with not trying to sell most of the stuff. But I have a bunch of random things that are not thrift store worthy but still have life and use left in them (for example: plastic paper folders/filers in perfectly good condition which were essential to me in grad school - this is a very useful item but I no longer need it). Previously I've given away a lot of random stuff on Buy Nothing groups but recently I've had a string of bad experiences and don't want to do that anymore because it's incredibly time and energy draining (so many flakes and no shows) and makes me feel pessimistic about other people. 

Environmental justice is really important to me and it feels wrong to throw something away just because I don't want it anymore. But I really don't have the time/energy to look for the specific person who wants the thing I'm giving away. 

So I'm looking for advice about how to move through this hurdle. ",declutter,1742968056.0

Struggling to declutter‚Äîtoo sentimental & too much stuff!,"
Hi guys, I‚Äôm 25 and still live with my parents. I love them, but my whole family has a hoarder gene. It took me years just to figure out how to keep my floor clear (which I‚Äôve finally managed), but now my issue isn‚Äôt organization‚Äîit‚Äôs that I simply have way too much stuff and struggle to let things go.

I‚Äôve tried decluttering before, but my mom always says, ‚ÄúLet me go through your bag to make sure you‚Äôre not throwing away anything good!‚Äù‚Äîand then she never does. So now I have bags of clothes just sitting there. I‚Äôve tried giving them to younger cousins, but they don‚Äôt want them anymore. I‚Äôve heard Goodwill and other places are full and not taking donations, so I don‚Äôt even know where to take my stuff.

And it‚Äôs not just clothes‚Äîmy room is filled with so much stuff, and I get too sentimental to part with a lot of it. Does anyone have advice on how to actually make progress when you‚Äôre sentimental, short on space, and can‚Äôt just donate everything?",declutter,1742931029.0
UPDATE: Took 2 weeks off work and spent the first week decluttering,"Previous post here: https://old.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/1jcr57t/took_2_weeks_off_work_and_spent_the_first_week/

The second week of our vacation was mostly spent doing staycation stuff. We visited family and hung around the house watching movies and playing games BUT we also did get some more decluttering done.

We went through the garage and donated the majority of what was in totes out there. I went through Christmas decorations and only kept about half of what I had. I'm donating all the other holiday decorations because we haven't used them since we moved here 5 years ago lol. We also broke down and recycled a bunch of boxes that were out in the garage. We still have a few things we need to decide on but it looks way better out there! 

We also donated our dining table to the ReStore (where we bought it originally) because we rarely used it aside from just piling it full of junk. Our apartment is one that expects that you put the dining table in the living room and I HATED seeing that stupid table sitting there unused all the time. Now it's gone and I feel so much lighter! 

We sold an additional 25 items on eBay plus 7 on Poshmark and Facebook. Total after fees (but excluding packaging costs) for everything sold thus far (both week 1 and week 2) comes to $2,318.69 and we still have about 45 items still listed on eBay and/or Poshmark. I don't expect that we'll sell everything. A lot of it is DVDs and Blu-Rays and I changed those to 1 cent auctions. Any movies left after the auctions expire are going to be donated. 

There is definitely still more work to be done but overall our apartment feels *much* less cluttered. I have partially filled boxes in nearly every room that I plan on dealing with this week which will make things even better. 

I have a few things that I want to declutter but need to buy replacements for first. For example, I have these big Pyrex mixing bowls that I hate. They're good quality but so freaking heavy so I don't like using them. I want to replace with some nice stainless steel mixing bowls. I also have some plastic food storage containers that drive me nuts because they ALWAYS come out of the dishwasher wet and they're hard to stack and whatnot so I want to replace with some glass dishes. But I'm holding onto those items until I get the replacements. Then I will set the ones I hate free. Someone else will love them. 

Also, I think I'm going to put a 1 month limit on selling anything that is left. I will be aggressive with price drops until things sell because a few bucks is better than $0 and I've already done the work of photographing and listing. Plus, I bought shipping supplies so I'd like to use all that up. If I use up all the shipping supplies I might just go ahead and donate everything that's left just so I don't have to go out and buy more stuff. 

Overall I highly recommend the declutter vacation. It was hard work but it was 100% worth it.",declutter,1742921651.0
"Finally using the ""what if i need this?"" Item after years of keeping it : was it worth it ?","You probably already know the answer since we're in a decluttering group, but here‚Äôs my take on it.

Four years ago, I gained a lot of weight. I held onto clothes I loved but couldn‚Äôt wear anymore, thinking, ""What if I need these when I lose the weight?"" So, I kept everything.

Fast forward to now‚ÄîI‚Äôve lost all the weight, even more than I needed to. I could finally wear those clothes again, so one afternoon, I tried them all on. It felt great.

But‚Ä¶ those clothes were over four years old, some even ten. My style had changed, the quality wasn‚Äôt that great, and my life was different‚ÄîI‚Äôd moved to a new region, started a new job, and some of those clothes weren‚Äôt even suitable for work.

So, was it worth keeping them? No. Even though it was fun to try them on for a day, I felt much better getting rid of the ones that were too big and buying new clothes that actually fit‚Äîboth my body and my current style.

And it‚Äôs not just clothes. I also kept an easel and tons of painting supplies because I love art and thought, ""What if I want to paint again someday?"" Turns out, I only enjoy drawing‚ÄîI don‚Äôt actually like painting.

Keeping things just in case rarely pays off. More often, it serves as a reminder of who we used to be or wish we were. For years, seeing those clothes I couldn‚Äôt wear made me feel like a failure. And when I finally could wear them, the joy didn‚Äôt outweigh the frustration they had caused.

People change. Styles change. Interests change. Keep what you actually use, wear, and love now. Letting go of the what ifs makes room for what truly fits your life today.",declutter,1742894757.0

One round done and I‚Äôm sooo happy!,"A huge thanks to this group and its helpful tips and useful information! 

First of all, I still have tons of stuff that need to go after I downsized my home. Mentally, I simply couldn‚Äôt bring myself to thoroughly declutter before the move, so there‚Äôs that, but the new smaller place forced me to get started. I started to apply the container concept and letting go of so so many what-if-and just-in-case items has freed up so much space! My new place looks so much better already, and I can totally see my new place being tidy and organized once I‚Äôm done with another round of decluttering and when all my furniture will be delivered and set up. I‚Äôm super motivated to keep going and will think twice before I bring in another item (and get rid of at least  one, of course!). 

You were right, of course, all that clutter takes up so much mental energy and time. Clutter can‚Äôt be organised, and clutter makes cleaning a nightmare. And it was so helpful to overcome the mental barrier of ‚Äúone day I might want/need it‚Äù. 

I had so many realisations along the way‚Ä¶ it was an interesting journey inwards as well. Sexy dresses that I wore 20 years ago and that fit again? Those might fit my body but they really don‚Äôt fit my age and my lifestyle any more. I need to let go of the past. That sports jacket I was given by a well-meaning friend and I didn‚Äôt really like it but kept as a spare? The ones I have are fine and they are enough. If I really really needed another sports jacket, I can afford to buy one that I will love to wear. That designer bag I kept in my closet for years with one handle slightly falling apart? I‚Äôm mad at the company and the poor quality they sell, and the bag makes me angry but hey, my friend is super-happy with it so I‚Äôm happy (and somehow at peace with the bag, ha ha). 

With your help, I was able to finish some arts/ crafts, and repair projects and get rid of others entirely. Apparently the projects I finished were dear to my heart and that‚Äôs something I‚Äôll keep in mind for the future: If it doesn‚Äôt make me happy, I probably won‚Äôt finish it anyway. I really shouldn‚Äôt let it weigh me down further but let go of it.

But then if it's a good sized cardboard box, I might keep that too.

Today, I moved from a rental to a condo I just bought. The condo is bigger than my rental but as I look around, I definitely have too much crap. I threw some stuff away but I kept so much ""treasures"".

Big closet-decluttering win for me!,"I (31F) have struggling with compulsive hoarding tendencies for truly as long as I can remember having ‚Äústuff‚Äù and have always had to battle a lot of anxiety to give/throw things away.

By doing this, I was able to donate 8(!!!) bags of clothing/ jackets/ accessories/ purses to a local mom whose teen daughter had just had a big growth spurt and needed a variety of items!

Our move is nearly complete,"We were able to move at the first of the month and have almost got everything moved. Like dumpsters, always order the next largest moving van! We are slowly unpacking boxes. Trying to set a goal of 5 a day.  Hubby has a lot of downsizing to do, but that is his problem, not mine. :)

We are working on finishing up some minor repairs on the old house to get in to the market in about two weeks.  The new house is a disaster of boxes and stuff to be put away.  It seems I get one room cleaned only to get more boxes in the next day from the garage.  I have started a small thrift store box.  I gave away an antique sewing machine already because we just didn't have the room for it.  I'd been looking for a 10-12 seat table and the day after we moved, my daughter found the perfect one at the thrift store for under $100!  So I rewarded them with the sewing machine to try and sell. :)

If  you are wondering can you let go, yes you can. Just get a box, put the items in the box and take it to the thrift store!  I am so glad I downsized before we moved. The cabinets here are much smaller than our older house, so we don't have as much room as I thought I would have.

My goal this last week was to get the house clean, and I made some progress, but hey, there's always this week.  Working 45 hours a week, plus working on the old house on the weekends, hasn't left me a lot of free time to get things done, but we are getting there slowly.

"organization techniques, pros/cons, etc.","Hi there- I'm working on new methods of organization at home, specifically in the space I work in the most.  I think my overall goal with decluttering is to have my space look clean, tidy, and minimal (or at least as close to it that I can get this).

I currently have a tall wire shelving rack (just in the room itself) with a bunch of sterilite bins on each shelf that have labels on them.  I have a lot of different types of projects I might get into in this space, so each bin is labeled by category for ease of locating.  There is some overlap of categories, and in general I'd say there is some filtering down to do in nearly every bin so as to get rid of things (which means some categories can be consolidated, making room for new ones etc.).  My father looked at this when visiting recently and said that it reminded him of my grandmother and mother.  At first I thought it was a jab, but then realized that maybe I've taken on some organizational techniques from them that I hadn't recognized prior.

I like that I can always know where things are and I don't have to fish around looking for categories as things are all labeled.  I'm now leaning towards moving all the bins from the rack into an adjacent closet where they'd be out of view, then removing the rack as again:  I'd like the space to be clean and minimal.

Could folks share their views and techniques to get things out of view?  What about organizational bins like this?  Gross and unsightly?  How do you find things if there are no labels on them?  Do you have alternatives you like?  Do you memorize categories by physical location?  How do you handle the challenge of wanting certain items accessible for different configurations and/or uses of a room, but also not disturbing the Feng Shui?  Etc.  I'm now considering investing in some nice cabinetry and/or custom drawer sets, but I'd like to enjoy the decision rather than regret it.",declutter,1742765525.0
Thoughts on books written by a family member you'll never read?,"My husband's grandma was a children's / young adult Christian novelist. She's written dozens of books, and we have a copy of most of them. We are never going to read them (we are not religious), and even when my husband was young and in the right demographic audience for them, he's only read one. Grandma isn't dead yet but has dementia and she lives out of state. We're moving in a few weeks and I'm wondering if it's worth the effort to ask if we can declutter some of these books. What are your thoughts, declutterverse? 

There are personalized inscriptions in most of them. Mostly ""dear [husband's name], love you very much, love Grandma."" 

In the end, packing them up and moving them yet again is not a hill I'm going to die on, but I do think it's stupid to pack up books you're never going to read, store them forever in a box in the attic or wherever, repeat this every time you move, and then leave them for your kids to deal with later or something. 

ETA: Yes, I'm gonna ask my husband - I don't declutter stuff that's not mine without permission.

I had a bit of a decluttering surge today.  :-),"This is a semi-success story, a work in progress, but evidently I can't submit my post unless I select some sort of flair.  May I suggest that mods add an ""in progress"" flair?  Anyway....

I can no longer afford my apartment (rent increase), and initially I was going to have to move out last August, but thankfully my parents were able to help me out a bit and so I will be in my current place at least until the end of my lease *this* August (and I'm working with a local affordable housing authority to hopefully buy a condo).  I mention this in order to say that I've known for about a year now that I will need to be moving within the next year or so, and I've had a couple of bouts of decluttering with that in mind. I actually donated about 800 books before I even knew about the rent increase and moving, simply because my spare room was absolutely *full* of them.

My other big problem area, other than books (which are now well under control, and at a reasonable amount) is clothes and shoes. I don't have the whole ""sunk cost fallacy"" thing going on, because 95% of my wardrobe I purchased at the thrift shop over the course of the past ten years, mostly for less than $5 per piece. It's just that I have *waaaaaaay* too many items of clothing and, to a lesser extent, shoes.  I have decluttered those things in the past year as well, but I still need to get rid of a *lot* more. Partly because I can't fit it all into my dressers (yes, multiple dressers) and closet (which is tiny) when everything is clean, and partly because I don't have a washer/dryer in my current place, so the dirty laundry really piles up (my sister lives about 10 minutes away from me, and thankfully lets me bring my laundry over to do at her house, but I hate having to haul it over and back, so I always put off doing it). Right now I have four large bags of dirty laundry.

SO -- I've just spent the past two hours going through *all* of my clothing and shoes. I have set aside 10 pairs of shoes/boots to donate (and this is after having donated at least 50 pairs over the past 2 years -- I did mention it's a problem area for me, lol!). I've also set aside one winter coat, 4 lighter coats/jackets, and a bunch of sweaters and pants to donate -- enough to fill 3 large garbage bags. I don't donate this stuff to my local thrift shop, because I'm there twice a week (although I've cut *way* down on my purchases), and it would be weird to see my stuff on the racks.  Instead, I bag it up and take it to my sister's house, and she and her husband take it with them to their church, which has a couple of those donation bins in its parking lot, and they put the stuff in there.

I did also go through my dirty laundry to try to cull some of that to launder and donate, but I only pulled a couple of things -- I guess the stuff that's dirty is the stuff I actually *wear*, so it's harder to get rid of, but I am just taking a break now to post this and have some dinner, and then I will go through that stuff again and try to pull more to donate.  

So, it's still a process. Every time I've moved in the past I've gotten rid of so much stuff, and this time is no exception. Moving sucks, but I do find that it *is* the perfect opportunity to declutter. I've decluttered kitchen stuff and knick-knacks over the past year, but I will need to give that stuff a few more passes as well. Wish me luck, lol!",declutter,1742684584.0
Slow Decluttering Method,"I wanted to share how I have been working on what I call my slow decluttering method if it resonates with anyone.

I have been getting rid of things that I don‚Äôt use at all. However, there are many things I use infrequently and I‚Äôve decided that I‚Äôm going to to try to get lots of use out of them or wear them out before I donate or get rid of them. 

For makeup, I‚Äôm using everything up. I only replace if I entirely run out of one category.

 I‚Äôm a huge book lover and buying books instead of reading them became a hobby for a while. I‚Äôm now reading through my very large TBR pile and I give away any book I don‚Äôt love after I‚Äôve read it. It is taking a super long time though. 

For clothes, I put away some clothes for months and then get them out to see if they still resonate. Usually a few pieces go away each time. I‚Äôm on a clothes no buy for this year. I broke it once and have bought one dress in the past 3.5 months.

The biggest factor in being able to declutter is not bringing anything in. I have reduced almost all of my shopping to consumables, mainly groceries and cleaning supplies when needed.

I know that a lot of people want and need to declutter many things very quickly, but I find that the slow decluttering method allows me to get use out of my things, be somewhat sustainable, and has a sort of meditative quality to it. The downside is that it‚Äôs easy to get impatient or give up.

"Parents passing on their clutter, by the car load","I have too much stuff; I admit it, and it's slowly improving, mainly through donating and car boot sales. I find it hard to stick to organisational systems, and if I don't see things they don't exist. A recent diagnosis of ADHD is helping to make sense of this for me. My own house is very much a work in progress, and as I live alone the main inconvenience is to me only.

But... my older parents method of decluttering is to fill vegetable trays (the ones you can get from Sainsburys) three at a time with various stuff, pass it to me at a time that I've got no opportunity to sort them for disposal (donate, sell, rubbish) and then repeat a few days later. These trays contain such random items that they usually take hours. I mostly end up stacking them in my hallway, where I become selectively blind to their existence. 

So, advice please? Aside from massively losing my patience with my parents, how can I get them to declutter in a way that doesn't just pass it all over to me? Thanks.",declutter,1742600187.0
Friday 15: Burden item!,"This week, we're going to choose one Burden Item. What's a Burden Item? It's a thing where thinking about why you *ought* to want to keep it, sell it, etc., consumes way more mental and emotional space than the value you get from the item.

Take your burden item. Thank it for its service (to you if you bought it, to the person who gave it to you if you got it from someone). Get rid of it. If you believe it's super-valuable, take the first steps to sell it *this weekend.* Otherwise, it's the donation bag or the trash. Congratulate yourself on freeing yourself from the bonds of things that have no value to you.

As always, share your favorite stories! (Gentle reminder: we do not declutter people or pets, even as a joke.)",declutter,1742572921.0
Moving in 3 months and feeling overwhelmed.,"I basically have been moving my junk from one place to another for years. I have boxes I packed from the last apartment in this one still. 

We've spent the better part of the last few years cleaning and decluttering the house we'll be moving into while taking care of relatives. It's still very overwhelming. It's a mix of sentimental stuff for my husband, and 50 years of acquired shit they was left for us to deal with. It's his childhood home so dealing with all their junk has been emotional for him and he's resistant to deal with it (but eventually does when he's overwhelmed and sick of looking at it).

We've unfucked the basement for the most part and been storing our less needed stuff there while we clean and renovate the house. Renovations are finally underway and it's dawning on me that I will need to take everything I own in my apartment and find a home for it at the house, or get rid of it. 

We've also acquired quite of a bit in the last few years and we both own too much. We're both the scattered type of ADD/ADHD and live out of doom piles. I always kind of expected I would ended up with someone better/neater than me but as it turns out, we're both like this. Every horizontal surface is cluttered even when I clear them off every few months, it only takes a bit of time until they're covered in something new. 

We both own far too many clothes. We both have a band T-shirt addiction and we go a little nuts buying merch at shows since we can afford it. I have ideas to send off a fair amount to one of those T-shirt quilt places. There's also some weight gain on both of us over the years so we both have stuff we're ""saving"" for when we become ""skinny again"". Lol.

We also have a roommate who's stuff is mostly contained to his room so he's not contributing too much to the mess. 

I know it's likely just that I don't have any routines and I try to just do a bunch when I have energy but that energy doesn't come as often as it used to. 

I guess any advice would be awesome, even though I ""know"" what I need to do, the doing it is a completely different story. ",declutter,1742562242.0
Getting rid of clothes.,"I have a beautiful walk in closet with a makeup station/vanity. I have a place for all my perfumes, shoes and handbags. Every year around spring I will declutter clothing. I started just saying, if I haven‚Äôt worn it this past year, it‚Äôs going to be donated/thrown out/given away to family or friends. The other thing I said to myself is: does it fit me well? Do I feel my best wearing it? Even if I paid a lot of money on it, I just throw it in the pile. I got rid of 3 bags of clothes! Now every piece of clothing is something I love, something I WILL wear. I‚Äôm never going to keep an entire wardrobe of clothes to pass on to my grandkids because who would want to wear my size 14/ xl hand me downs ? lol üòÜ I am also not shopping at top of the line clothing stores. I mostly wear Amazon, H&M, skims, old navy, and Walmart. So yes it‚Äôs easy to just say good bye to the clothes. At the end of the day, they served me well. Even if I didn‚Äôt wear it often, I can say thank you for the little burst of dopamine when I purchased an item online.

Am I crazy for wanting to get rid of my bed?,"I (M25) live with my parents in the smallest bedroom of the house and it's a pretty tiny room.

Piano decluttering (30 yo digital),"I have an electric piano with fully weighted keys which has a number of sounds such as grand piano, etc. it is 30 years old but in excellent condition. I bought it as a reward for finishing a degree with every intention of improving my limited music skills. I spent $4,000 on it, which was a lot back then. (To me it still is.)

The kids took lessons and then stopped. I took a few lessons and stopped. Unfortunately, it has some very difficult memories associated with it and every time I tell myself I am going to start again, all those bad feelings and memories come back up. 

I decided it was time to let it go. I reached out to a company that specializes in buying and consigning pianos.  They won‚Äôt take it. They gave me the name of a removal company instead. 

It‚Äôs hurting my heart to think it‚Äôs going to the dump.

I don‚Äôt think I can sell it given the piano company‚Äôs response and if I put it for free on marketplace I still have to deal with the lookie loos and can‚Äôt face this. I also don‚Äôt want my neighbours being nosey as they don‚Äôt know I am planning on selling my house and this is part of that downsizing. I live alone and often get unsolicited advice about what I ‚Äúshould‚Äù do. 

Any insights on how to get this piano out of my life both physically and emotionally would be appreciated. FWIW it weighs 180 pounds and is small enough to fit into the back of my car. 

Thank you. I have been inspired by so many posts in this subreddit and appreciate your insights.

Edited for update: I tried many places to donate this digital piano and there were no takers. Every call I made or post I listed brought all the awful feelings up for that piano. Last night I had the hard emotional work of getting through a lot of really awful feelings. There were many tears, some scream crying and a bit of hyper ventilation. But I felt the feelings, drank some water and went to bed. Today the sun came up and my heart was not as sore. 

I had junk removers come in to do a small demolition and asked them if they could take a large bookcase. They said yes. And as they removed it I decided to take the courageous step to finally let the piano go. They loaded on the trailer and it‚Äôs gone. 

I did it. I let it go. Unfortunately it has gone to landfill but no one wanted it for free and now it is not in my face every day!! I have turned the page on that part of my life.

Wardrobe help needed!,"I am in the process of moving home and I'm decluttering the house in preparation. I am really struggling with my clothes, I have 3 wardrobes and one of them is just dresses. A lot of them have only been worn once and some still have the tags on. I have taken out about half of them that I no longer like or would never wear again. I'm feeling really guilty about all the money I spent on them, I know I could list them on Vinted but I feel I really don't have the mental capacity for that right now. I have a young family and we are moving in 6 weeks or so there is a lot to do as the house is jam packed. I'm torn between trying to recoup some money by selling what I can in the next few weeks or just cutting my losses and giving it all to charity. I feel guilty about the money spent and part of me is wondering whether to hold on to them and try and sell them once I've moved. What would you do?",declutter,1742498178.0
This was the last straw üôÑ,"The wardrobe collapsed a few weeks ago. Terrible timing as it was two days before we went away on holiday. The house has been in in complete chaos ever since as I had to empty it all out before it did any more damage .  But I couldn't get it sorted before we went away. 

Since our return, I've been laid low with a bug I picked up but I was determined to make sure that when we finally repaired the wardrobe, nothing (and I mean nothing) was going back in without purpose. I found so much stuff that I'd forgotten I had. (A dozen pairs of leggings, more scarves than you could wrap a mummy in, shapewear)  It was all tidy, it all fitted in my lovely organisational boxes, but I'd never missed any of it, let alone used any of it, since it was first 'organised'. So every day, I've done maybe 15 minutes of sorting because I haven't had the energy to do any more. 

I'm already on 4 full bags for donation with more to go. I thought I'd been really good in listing 5 pairs of tagged, unworn leather boots straight on Vinted. I'd intended to give them 2 weeks then they'd be donated - I thought it would make me feel better about the waste of money if I could at least recoup a little bit back. 

That was until this morning when I was getting ready for a last minute doctors appointment. Because everything is everywhere at the moment (he's promised the wardrobe will be fixed this weekend) the boots are lined up next to the bed. In my rush I just tripped over them and fell. I think I was lucky not to break my wrist. Anyway, that's just the push (üòÇ) I needed. I got back from my appointment, delisted everything and put it all in another bag to donate. No more answering questions like 'are the boots comfortable?' I don't know- they've never been on my feet! No more feeling insulted that someone wants them for nothing....nope, it's not worth the stress to try to sell. I've always wavered between sell/ donate. No more! The boots that attempted to kill me this morning made my decision really easy. Be gone, be happy, be out of my space. ",declutter,1742482383.0
Success! Finished sorting deceased MILs home,"For the last 6 months, my husband and I have been sorting my MIL enormous and entirely too packed home. With the help of many friends, and grueling work, we have completed our mission to sort through everything. 

What is left is for the estate sale. We have an angel for an agent who has helped us make some presales, including 4k hardback books, fine silver, and 400 dolls. 

We donated 2k+ garments, 800+ shoes, 4k paperbacks (to the library), enough art/craft supplies to fill a 10x10 room, and so much more. And we filled a 15 yard dumpster and a 20 yard dumpster already. 

Estate sale company has taken over, and will be prepping for 5 weeks to get ready for the sale at the end of April. 

I'm so proud of us, and proud of myself for not completely losing it during this process. It's hard to comprehend that we're done. There was so much to do, and 100s of hours have been spent sorting through everything.  

I'm so grateful for the friends who have come over to help us, including a friend who has been living in the house since MIL passed. That is such a huge weight off our shoulders that we don't have to worry about the property. And I'm so grateful for the estate sale agent who is ready to get it done for us.

System to determine how many clothes you need,"Hi,

This might be a long shot, but I hope someone here knows what I am talking about an can help me. I am kind of frustrated because I know I read this somewhere, and now that I want to work on my wardrobe and declutter my clothes, I can't find it anymore.

Someone somewhere on the internet had a system to determine how many clothes you actually need, based on your real life. I am not sure exactly how it works anymore, but I think it was based on how many times you do laundry and how many times you (for example) exercise between laundry days. There were also some kind of rule about work clothes and casual clothes, pyjamas, shoes, etc. to determine how many you needed. Or maybe it was about how many times you wear work-wear per month or something?

I have searched my laptop files, Google, YouTube and Reddit, but I can't find it and I don't know anymore what it (the system) was called. Does anyone know what I am looking for and can provide me a link or description or something?

Full house declutter update!,"First off I want to thank everyone who gave me tips and words of encouragement on my last post. I thought about you guys through all of my declutterring and cleaning that went on this week and it really helped keep me motivated and held myself accountable for doing at least something everyday.  

So for my victories:

1. I cleared out our front door area. When you come into the house now it‚Äôs CLEAR. There is a small shoe rack and 3 dog leashes for our 3 dogs. This has been great, because I don‚Äôt immediately feel overwhelmed/overstimulated when I come home. 

2. I cleaned the pantry out. Got rid of any expired food or food I knew would never get eaten. I also reorganized so we actually know what we have. 

3. I cleared out two junk drawers. There‚Äôs actually room in both of them now. I, again, couldn‚Äôt believe how much crap we were holding onto!

4. Cleaned out my old shipping/tool cabinet. I used to be an artist that sold a lot of stuff online and I had half a cabinet dedicated to recycled shipping supplies and the other half dedicated to random tools. I don‚Äôt ship stuff anymore so I got rid of ALL OF IT! I didn‚Äôt feel guilting since it was all reused bubble mailers and bubble wrap. I was able to fit all the tools back in and have room for other things that don‚Äôt need to live on the counter. 

5. I got almost all of our Christmas decorations taken down and back in our spare bedroom. The spare bedroom will be a project for another time, but having all our Christmas stuff down feels so good. 

6. I cleaned up our entertainment area. Not much was trash, but since I‚Äôve been able to declutter a decent amount in the house, I was able to find homes for a lot of the things that previously laid on the floor. 

7. Probably my most proud achievement this week. I actually took all the donations to the thrift shop today. I drive a larger suv, so I put the third row down, and FILLED the trunk. I dropped it all off today and now I don‚Äôt have the donation pile to look at.

8. The only thing I purchased this week (other than groceries) was a small dollar store tote to put dog toys in. The past two weeks of working on the house I‚Äôve noticed that I have nowhere to pickup and put dog toys. So a small little tote now holds all of their toys and it‚Äôs accessible for them to grab toys out of.

Scrapbooking declutter,"We're moving next month, so it's time to put our decluttering skills into overdrive!

"Getting rid of old broken things is harder for me than getting rid of new, unused ones...","Hi everyone,

I'm new on this subreddit, but I've started my decluttering journey a couple of years ago. So far so good, the only items I have trouble with are books (I love books and buying books) and skincare (I still haven't found the perfect routine, and I keep trying new products that often ruin my skin, hurray). Other than that, my home is practically clutter-free.

  
I've noticed, however, that it is way easier for me to throw away something if it is new or almost unused (e.g. a skincare product I dislike), rather than an old object that I've used for years but is now destroyed. 

I just bought a new sports bag because the one I've been using for more than ten years is ripped and stained, so it was high time I replaced it. However, now that I have to throw the old one away, I feel horribly bad. It's like throwing away an old friend, and all the memories attached to it. I took it with me to my beach vacations in Spain, I loved the fact that each pocket had its special use, and I feel like by throwing it away, it's a period of my life that I'm throwing away with it, and it won't come back. I know what I'm saying makes no sense, and whether or not I keep this bag I won't use it anymore, so why would I keep it? I still find it very hard to throw it out, though.

Does anybody else sometimes feel this way too?",declutter,1742377243.0

I have sooo many toys but I don't want to let go,"I 18f have so many toys and so much lego from my childhood and I just about have the space for it but honestly I'd probably be better off without it.
But the problem is I kind of view them as collections... 
I have 
1. A doll collection with some valuable dolls
2. A figurene collection
3. Stuffed animals and plushies
4. HEAPS of sylvanian families
5. Lego that I don't really view as a collection but I can see myself using again

I still have a big interest in toys and collecting so occasionally I also bring in new stuff that I prefer to display these days. So the amount gets even bigger... I really am having trouble letting go especially of my lego and dolls... 
It's not at hoarder level because I rarely bring new stuff in and keep it all organised, but my room just looks so damn childish and honestly it's too much stuff. 

My parents won't let me put it in the attic because our attic is bad and I don't want to move it to other parts of the house because then I'm just facilitating the problem, so everything stays in my room and it takes an age every spring to keep it all categorised and organised in case I ever decide to display it and because I'm a bit of a control freak...

But I want a room that looks a bit more adult now where I can still display some of my collection in a more orderly fashion. I want a calm room. 
Rn my room is like a 9 year olds because my parents won't let me paint it either... So all I have is de cluttering! 

Will I regret it if I let go of some of the weaker links in my collection? 
For example the dolls are very special to me but only some of them are actually in good condition for display. The rest are kinda just for customisation/ barbies I played with and they sit in a box...It takes up so much space.

My lego i'm keeping cuz I have loads and whenever I do pull it out I actually still have fun with it but I haven't done that in years... But what if I have a kid and they like lego??? 
I don't wanna let it go...

Maybe I could part with a few dolls but idk man it wouldn't make that much difference. The sylvanians idk I have huge houses and cars and stuff belonging to them... ",declutter,1742206808.0
What to do about ‚Äúalmost‚Äù clothes.,"This isn‚Äôt in terms of sizing due to weight changes (e.g. ‚Äúif I lose 5 pounds this would legit fit perfectly‚Äù). This is in terms of unchangable aspects of clothes.

Some examples:

- A sweatshirt that is a unique color and has fun sleeve details, but is also super long and boxy, and only looks good tucked into one specific pair of jeans. And I‚Äôm not sure if altering it to be shorter will really fix the issue, and I‚Äôm hesitant to throw money into it if not. ($15-20 btw, I did ask two tailors.) It looks pretty cute with that one pair of jeans. It looks awful with just about anything else.

- A dress which if it were just a few inches longer would be perfect for work, and is very cute, but also wouldn‚Äôt look right with something underneath (like a longer skirt, or pants/leggings). But it also doesn‚Äôt work aesthetically for any other occasions in my life. MAYBE a dinner at a friend‚Äôs house or something. But it‚Äôs also short sleeved and doesn‚Äôt look as cute with a jacket or sweater (it works with a work blazer though), and I feel like most of my friends keep their houses cold lol. Anyway it‚Äôs cute but because it is so niche, I‚Äôve only worn it once in the past 5 years. (And yes, it still fits perfectly aside from the length)

- A romper which only works with one specific bralette that I own, and only looks good when I‚Äôm a bit tanned. Otherwise it‚Äôs a cute little brunch romper. Or maybe for a vacation somewhere warm, if I‚Äôm also not walking so much that I can‚Äôt wear sandals or fashion sneakers‚Ä¶ Again with it being so niche I‚Äôve only worn it 1-2 times in the past 3 years.

Anyway I have a good number of clothes that fall into this category. I‚Äôm torn on what to do with them, as in keep vs. get rid of. 

It‚Äôs also already very hard for me to find clothes that fit right to begin with. I‚Äôm short and few brands (except for mostly very expensive ones and only with certain aesthetics) make petites anymore, and it‚Äôs rare for me to find pants or tops I love so much that I‚Äôm willing to shell out the extra money and time for alterations. (I know Nordstrom offers free alterations on a lot of stuff, but their clothes often run expensive unless on sale) so I have a tendency to be like, ok maybe I should hold on to some of these ‚Äúalmost‚Äù clothes and make them work, along with the clothes I own that I actually do love and wear regularly‚Ä¶ I know this is totally illogical lol but my point being, I do have somewhat of a scarcity mindset as it‚Äôs rare for me to find good-quality, not radically expensive, clothes that I love and also fit me well. But I also want more room in my closet for when I do hopefully discover more of those clothes‚Ä¶ basically unicorn clothes lol, it‚Äôs pretty hard to find truly great ones these days!",declutter,1742179977.0
"I read only large text now and I'm thinking of getting rid of my old ""comfort"" paperbacks - thoughts?","I have some vision problems and somehow when the great middle aged change to my eyes came, reading glasses didn't help. They just give me a headache. So at this point I mostly read things on the computer and resize the text, or on Kindle / iPad and resize the text. 

Over the years I've come to accept this and I got rid of a lot of books. I still have books that are reference books, as I can read for 10 minutes or so before it becomes really uncomfortable. And I have kept a lot of graphic novels, because the text is a bit larger and you're also looking at pictures so you can rest your eyes. 

But I struggle with my old books. We get so attached to them and they're a part of us. For example I've had the same paperback of Robin McKinley's *The Blue Sword* for literally decades. I've read it countless times. It's falling apart and well-loved. But the last time I tried to read it, I just gave up and checked out a digital copy from the library. 

I've got my deceased father's copy of The Hobbit, and some other copies of the Lord of the Rings that were a gift.

Movers or junk removal service?,"Hello!

I have a few old items to remove from the household, and I live with an elderly relative who is not fit to help me in the removal. I am thinking about hiring a mover to just move the large items to the curb and have the waste company pick them up, but I am also wondering about junk removal services. The items are as follows:

* A broken 42 inch flat panel TV (first floor)
* Old queen-size mattress (2nd floor)
* An exercise machine (2nd floor)
* Old metal workbench (garage)
* Broken fountain (in several pieces, back yard)

Do movers perform these ""move items from dwelling to the curb"" type ""moves,"" and roughly how much do you think these items would cost to ""move"" or junk?

If they are too expensive, I might just slow-haul (like moving the mattress couple flights of stair at a time, rest, repeat, and skip the workbench / fountain)

I cleaned out my garage,"It‚Äôs been a place I‚Äôve avoided for a long time. The house has been in my family since it was built 75 years ago, and lots of stuff has been left behind by others and I also used it as a place where things I couldn‚Äôt deal with went to die. 

I rented a dumpster this weekend and threw almost everything away. I pretty quickly realized when I started working that mice (god I hope it‚Äôs mice) had gotten in at some point and chewed through *everything*. Bags of soil. An old bag of dog food. Bags and boxes of human food that were left in an old pantry. There was dirt and food everywhere and SO MUCH MOUSE POOP.

Took 2 weeks off work and spent the first week decluttering and got so much done!!!!!,"My husband and I took 2 weeks off work and decided to dedicate the first week to decluttering. We even got a bonus day at the beginning because his boss called as he was heading to work that day and asked if he wanted to take 1 more day of PTO. He took it, came home, and got started immediately. 

In the past week we've done 3 Goodwill runs with the back of the car filled with boxes and bags of items we no longer need, filled our outdoor trash and recycling bins to the brim twice, sold 37 items on eBay ($1452.79 after fees but excluding shipping supplies cost), mailed off a box of old eyeglasses to a charity, and went through 90% of the stuff in our apartment. 

We also got some spring cleaning projects done like cleaning out the dryer vent. We even discovered that there was a hole in one of the connections and now we know why our bathroom (where our washer and dryer are) was always coated in lint. We replaced it and hopefully the lint accumulation will finally slow down. 

We still have some stuff left to declutter like under the bathroom and kitchen sinks and the garage and I have more stuff to list on eBay but we're exhausted so we're going to take it pretty easy for the next week and maybe just get 30-60 minutes of decluttering and spring cleaning projects done per day. 

If you can swing this, I highly recommend doing it. It feels like we just moved to a new place. There are some little messes here and there but it's nothing like it was before. I wish I had taken before pictures.",declutter,1742147259.0
Tricked kids into decluttering with me,"As an adult with some inattention issues, I frequently end up creating ""boxes of doom"" when decluttering. Sometimes I just need a clear surface to think straight and then lose steam before it's all put away. (I have read Dana K White and do try to practice one thing at a time, but it's a process.) 

The parenting trick: I told my girls (7 & 4) we were doing a reverse scavenger hunt! I walked them around their playroom to remind them of certain containers and then gathered all my boxes of doom. I handed each kid an item and told them where it went. They took off running to put it in it's place, then came back and I paid them in monopoly money. We did this for almost an hour, got all the boxes sorted, and the kids had a blast! They made 63 trips in total, all over the house. I also had a trash bag next to me to easily toss things.

It helped me so much to just send off each item as I picked it up instead of pulling out everything, sorting it into various piles, and then making all the trips myself. For instance, there were Legos in three of the four piles. No problem, the kids ran to the Lego table four times. 

Bonus, we worked on counting and making change with the monopoly money (yay educational moment) and they now know where certain things go. Hopefully they'll be able to help keep things tidy in the future. We did this all yesterday and my littlest already asked if we can do it again today.",declutter,1742146019.0

READ ALONG Zasio chapter 2,"This is a big chapter, full of rationales that people put ahead of having a pleasant space. The list of examples is long, but they fall into four broad categories:

1. Storing evidence of the past: gear from long-ago hobbies, clothes from lifestyles you no longer live, trophies and T-shirts from old achievements, college textbooks you haven't opened again.
2. Stockpiling items to serve a hypothetical future: keeping things for grandchildren, buying for a house that's years away, stocking up for hobbies you don't have time to do.
3. Holding onto large amounts of things ""just in case"" or because ""they could be useful"" -- without having a concrete near-term use-case for them.
4. Self-punishment: holding onto items that remind you of bad times, or that tell you you've become a worse person.

Zasio's ""take action"" suggestions all amount to weighing whether not-having the item would really make things better or worse. So let's try that, with one of her quizzes. (As always, open discussion on anything in this chapter is welcome, too!)

**Exercise**. Pick an item in your home (preferably in your problem area from chapter 1) and ask yourself:

1. What do you feel when you see the item?
2. How did you acquire it?
3. Why do you keep it?
4. What do you think it would mean if you got rid of it?
5. What do you fear would happen if you let go of the item?",declutter,1742128051.0

I saw my donated item out in the wild,"Hey everyone! About a year ago I donated a specialty shawl from a country very dear to me. Now this shawl had a very unique combination of pattern and colors as well as tassels - very distinguishable from other shawls (this becomes important later). As an art object, it was beautiful, but it was not my style for wearing at all, so I decided to pass it on.

Flash forward to last weekend. I drove three hours to a small town that was putting on a play by a writer from the aforementioned country. So I‚Äôm watching this play and all of a sudden, BOOM, costume change! And one of the actresses comes out in a dress with her shoulders covered by, you guessed it, my shawl that I had donated a year ago, about a hundred miles away. It was unmistakably the same shawl, as those kinds are just not produced or sold anywhere around here. 

I was super happy to know that my shawl was living a good life and honored that the costume designer managed to get her hands on such an authentic piece for a play so far away from where I originally donated it. It now forms part of an art form enjoyed by hundreds of viewers instead of lying there unworn in my drawer.

READ ALONG: Zasio intro & chapter 1,"Welcome to our read-along of Dr. Robin Zasio's *The Hoarder in You: How to Live a Happier, Healthier, Uncluttered Life.* Get your library copy and join in! Posts will contain some material from the book, but you'll get more out of it if you have the whole book. (This is not sponsored in any way. It just seemed like an idea.) There will be posts 3x a week: Friday, Sunday, and Wednesday (using U.S. Pacific time zones).

There will be quizzes and/or exercises with each post!

**Introduction**

Dr. Zasio admits to the existence of The Make-Up Drawer. 

>There are crumbling eye shadows in colors I haven't worn in years, and dried-up eye liners, pencils, and lipsticks that I loved when I purchased them (though after applying them for the first time, realized they weren't right for me). Rather than throwing away the useless lipsticks, which felt like a waste, I thought ""What if I need them? You never know...""

**Chapter 1** introduces the premise of the book: ""The way hoarders think about their possessions is in many ways not terribly different from the way non-hoarders approach the stuff in their lives."" That reasoning?

* I'm afraid I'll need it later
* It would be wasteful
* It was a good deal
* Someone I love gave it to me

The difference between a non-hoarder and a hoarder is ""a hoarder is unable to take into account important factors like whether keeping an item may cause him more harm than good.""

If you have access to the book, please comment on anything that struck you in the Introduction or Chapter One!

**Exercise:** What's your Make-Up Drawer (the place you can't bring yourself to declutter even though you know you should)? If your first impulse is to say ""my whole house,"" stop and identify a smaller spot to tackle. This is going to be your initial place to declutter as we work through the book, though you can obviously work on other areas of your home.",declutter,1741955493.0

Getting rid of parents books after they died,"I‚Äôve been gradually and painfully trying to sort through everything in the house after my dad passed away 2 years ago and my mum last year. Both my parents had deep interest and expertise in their fields of work, and kept lots of specialist books on the subjects. My dad also was a voracious reader and had plenty of fiction, history, anything he would have an interest in. He was also a hoarder which makes this all a lot harder.

Now that they‚Äôre gone I‚Äôve struggled to part with many of these books, even though my intention isn‚Äôt to keep a hoard of my parent‚Äôs belongings. The big stumbling block I come up against is feeling like there‚Äôs this repository of knowledge they worked to gain over the course of their lives, much of which could be hard to find from other easily available sources. When I was younger I wouldn‚Äôt have had much interest in the topics of some of these, but as I‚Äôve got older and find myself curious about topics that might have seemed dull or old fashioned in earlier life, I find it hard to trust that I won‚Äôt come to regret getting rid of this library. I also no longer have the chance to ask my parents to share their knowledge when I need it and many of these books feel like the last connection to that.

I‚Äôm sure this falls into the behaviour of keeping things ‚Äòjust in case‚Äô, but the leap from having these possessions within touching distance to a future when it‚Äôs all irreversibly gone feels very hard to make.",declutter,1741885156.0
Stuff that 'might come in useful',"Over the last 3 years I've been making progress with getting rid of things in storage which I've realised I will never use, or which I can't afford to take when I move overseas. 

And a flood a few years ago made me realise that the 'sentimental' items I was keeping didn't have the sentimental value I thought they did. I dried out and restored precisely one thing out of the hundreds that were ruined by the flood.

But I'm still keeping a lot of stuff because it's 'perfectly good' or 'might come in useful'. 

The trouble is, when I do need a ratchet screwdriver or a pry bar or an anti-fungal spray or a lighter summer jacket, I need one NOW, not in a storage unit 100 miles away. It costs time and money to go there and fetch the item - more time and money than it does to buy another one locally.

So I'm gradually realising that those kinds of need-it-now item aren't worth keeping if I know that I can source a replacement in any location I'm likely to be in.

I should only be keeping them if they're both hard to source a replacement for, and possible to do without for the time it would take me to fetch the stored one.",declutter,1741880530.0

Doing a full house declutter and feeling lost and overwhelmed,"I seriously started this journey last week. I‚Äôve been wanting to declutter since we moved into this house, but have always been too lazy to actually do it. I‚Äôm now determined to make this happen and finally feel comfortable in my house. 

For context, we moved into a property my parent‚Äôs own 4 years ago and it‚Äôs full of their stuff as well as ours. My parents have always been borderline hoarders and I was never taught proper cleaning skills from them. I‚Äôve only ever been taught ‚Äúif it‚Äôs not trash it‚Äôs worth keeping‚Äù and ‚Äúif you paid money for it, you can‚Äôt throw it out‚Äù. I work 5-6 days a week and my day(s) off I usually spend trying to recover. But I‚Äôm determined now to make my house a home - not a prison in which I feel nothing but chaos. I also want to be able to have friends over/have my sons friends over and not be embarrassed by all the mess and clutter. I want to feel peace when I walk through my doors every night. My boyfriend and parents don‚Äôt care at all about how much shit is in the house and it‚Äôs super discouraging. My boyfriend is also a borderline hoarder, so I feel super alone in this process. I love him and he‚Äôs so far been encouraging of the process, but I know he doesn‚Äôt care enough to spend a day and declutter with me. My son is 11 and doesn‚Äôt know anything other than living in clutter. I want to be an example for him that a clean living space is achievable.

I started in our master bathroom and tossed two trash bags worth of products we will never use/expired products. We all couldn‚Äôt believe how much shit we actually had in there that wasn‚Äôt being used. It felt so good to be able to do a whole room in one day. I now have counter space and everything has its place in the bathroom, so I‚Äôm confident I can keep it clean. 

I moved into working on our living space this week. I‚Äôve already thrown away 4 trash bags worth of stuff and started a decent donations pile. Today I made good headway on our ‚Äújunk corner‚Äù I call it that because that‚Äôs where we put stuff when we clean and NEVER go back to look at it. I wish I had the will power to toss it all, but I started to feel sentimental towards certain things, and some things I don‚Äôt want to toss because they are my boyfriends, not mine. I‚Äôm hoping the tidier our place becomes, the more willing I am to let stupid little things go. I just couldn‚Äôt today. I threw out half of what was in the corner and the other half I kept. I feel so discouraged I couldn‚Äôt just detach from it all and toss everything. I haven‚Äôt looked at most of that crap in almost 4 years. Why couldn‚Äôt I toss it?! 

I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about this. I feel silly being attached to so much stuff that I don‚Äôt ever interact with. Our house is just so big I don‚Äôt see how I will get through the whole thing. Sorting through 5 peoples stuff by myself is tedious. I have piles of stuff to give back to my parents that I know they will want, and I have made the executive decision to get rid of stuff I know for a fact they don‚Äôt even remember is here. They‚Äôre getting older and where they live is already over run with stuff. I feel guilty for piling more on them as well as tossing stuff at my own discretion. 

Sorry for such a long rant that is all over the place. I just needed to vent about something that is weighing so heavily on me. 

Has anyone with a larger home gone through a full house purge? How long did it take? Honestly any words of encouragement or tips to make it more manageable would be much appreciated. I just want a home I feel comfortable in. This house has so much potential to be gorgeous. I want to be proud to have people over for visits and comfortable with my son‚Äôs friends coming over.

Time saved from decluttering,"I've never considered myself to have much of an issue with clutter. However, I have at times balked a bit about getting rid of things. My wife, however, loves getting rid of things--almost to an extreme. Together, we have come to the conclusion that time is our most important commodity, and this helps guide our decluttering decisions. 

Our golden rule: Will keeping this item save us time or cost us time over the next two years? 

Granted, the rule is somewhat subjective. But, it lets us think in terms of something other than money or space.

Example application: I have a box of old cables of various purposes. Video, audio, USB, computer cables, power cords, etc. We recently went through the box and threw a lot of cables away. The thought process was, will this cable save me time in the next two years? If the cable was unique and in good shape, it would get saved (it could save a trip to the store to get one). But if it was a duplicate, it was likely just going to make finding the cable I actually need harder to find, and at that point it had more potential to cost time than to save time. Or if the cable was unlikely to be used in the next two years, it would probably go away. Am I going to use that old S-Video cable I used with my VCR in the next two years? No, so it's not going to save me time. Send it away. 

Example with clothing: I have a drawer full of socks and underwear. We generally do laundry twice a week, and it's uncommon that I would ever need more than about seven pairs of socks. But... a few times each year we miss a laundry day due to other commitments. If I run out of socks, I would either need to do laundry at an inconvenient time, wear dirty socks (ick), or run to the store and buy more. The extra sock supply is quite likely to save me time more than once in the coming year. So the sock drawer stays well-stocked (well-socked?) 

Anyway, the rule has generally been working well. It may not always apply in all circumstances, but it's a nice change from some of the other guidelines or there.

I started by donating the ones I knew I would never play. Then I moved onto the systems themselves. Some of them are really neat and I think are cool reminders of where the technology was at the time they came out.

They all technically sparked joy and brought back fond memories‚Ä¶but I don‚Äôt think I needed to keep them in a closet to remind me of that. 

I‚Äôm happy to say I‚Äôm more than halfway through. I‚Äôve sold and donated about six different video game consoles, and a countless amount of games. It feels really nice to know that someone else is enjoying them. 

I‚Äôm still keeping a few that I know aren‚Äôt available on the internet in case I wanna play it again down the road, but it feels almost transcendental to move on from my attachment to this idea of a collection. The closet space is also quite nice!

How do i downsize 3 shoe boxes worth of junk journaling materials?,"for those that don‚Äôt know junk journaling is a type of journaling where you use scrap material and stuff throughout your day to make your spread. 
I‚Äôve collected material for close to 10 years. Ranging from decorative napkins, to birthday cards, movie tickets, fortune cookies, any small paper i could draw a connection to really that wld fit in a journal. 

I‚Äôve always wanted to junk journal hence why i‚Äôve always collected materials for it but i haven‚Äôt actually started practicing journaling until recently.

And i know typically there‚Äôs a rule not to keep materials for habits of the ideal you rather keep stuff for the current you, but i‚Äôm at a place where its actually realistic for me to stick to this habit of junk journaling since i actually am regularly journaling now.

"Closet of doom, uncluttering my husband's hand me downs","So I have this walk in closet that is full to the brim of stuff my in laws have given us and my husband has collected and insisted on keeping. It's insane. I have so far sorted through tons of stuff. I am now going through and organizing the keeps and it's annoying because the things my husband wants to keep are ridiculous to me but important to him so I'm trying. For instance 10-15 boxes of very old (1930's to 1970's) science fiction books. I am unboxing and removing the books so they are packed properly, labeled and easy to carry when we move. So far I have reduced 8 boxes to 4. I still have at least 8 more boxes to go through but at the end I will have reduced the bulk without actually getting rid of anything. I took 4 totes of photographs and turned that into 2 by taking photos out of old frames and scanning the ones of mine that I felt were important, keeping a few and discarding the rest of mine. He has a giant tote that is all just his family photo books that I refuse to touch. I have found multiple boxes of cds my husband wants to keep. I am thinking of storing these in totes like the dvds. I also have a couple boxes of ""keepsakes"" that are all wrapped up in paper for moving. I am not sure if I should repack those or just leave them be. At this point I anticipate at least being able to walk into the closet and easily identify what and where things are but I would love love love to just donate all the dvds and books and cds. There's just too much!!! I hate to even say it but if I were ever widowed I would just put all that on a truck and say good bye. Am I a jerk for thinking that??

Decluttering deceased spouse's belongings.,"Many years ago, my spouse died rather suddenly and traumatically. I will not provide any additional information on his death as it is not relevant. At the time I was lost in grief and dealing with pregnancy hormones. I had a few days to pack his belongings and I kept everything because it felt wrong to get rid of his stuff. It's been almost 12 years and I need to purge it before our child starts going through it. I thought it had been long enough and I could do this objectively. I was wrong. I went through a single crate and realized I was trying to keep 90% of it. I had memories attached to everything, but unfortunately our kid doesn't, because she never had an opportunity to form a bond with him. 

How do I know what's important? How many band tees are too many to keep? Should I keep every doodle and journal?

I don't have anyone's memories to offer her but my own and great aunts. 

I have gotten rid of the generic shorts and pants. I kept the Tripp pants because those were his favorite. I decided his socks could go üòÖ yeah I really held on to old socks for 12 years. I know how ridiculous it sounds.

Well you can imagine how infrequently that happens.

For this month I am committing to 5 things a day. Minimum. I should have no problem finding at LEAST five things to either get rid of, or put in its proper place.

So context, I have OCD so my ""clutter"" is that and hoarding tendencies I inherited from my hoarder dad. I have been in a functional depression since I got body slammed by both my parents dying within 18 months of each other, being made homeless and jobless and having to move the 3 bed family home with me. 

I got a job I'm still at and I moved but it has been 5 years. We had a whole pandemic. I just never had the energy or desire to fix the clutter. I had a bathroom that was not functional because I was trying to make use of items that there wasn't anything wrong with. I had cupboards filled with clothes I would never wear. I had doom piles. I had an excess of cleaning products I didn't use because they comforted my OCD. On my birthday, (Feb 3rd) my brother who is the opposite of me in this respect said to me, ""you have a lot of stuff"" which sounds fine but I know exactly what he meant. We grew up in the same house. It annoyed me because inside I agreed but I had no energy to tackle the mammoth task.

Now, the success part, I started Zoloft on the highest dose I've ever been on (100mg) in Jan and at week 8, I had a surge of energy and the burning desire to yeet anything that did not serve me.

I have spent the last week destroying my clutter. I have donated via collection 7 clothing bags, 2 book bags, I have a basket of stuff to donate locally, I did 6 recycling break down trips and ripped out 10 bags of trash. No cupboard or wardrobe was untouched. I reorganised my systems. I repurposed items that I hoarded (pillows???). My home is no longer a safety hazard that something might fall out of a cupboard and brain you. Showering doesn't require anything beyond me getting into the dang thing.

Sometimes it feels like you can't get there after so long but you can. I believe in you.

Book jackets- problems,"Hello,

who else grew up poor and feel guilt when decluttering?,"I threw out some old essential oils that were gifted to me and felt guilt because they would have been a luxury item growing up. My old mindset would have been to use it to the very last drop by adding it into a cleaning routine and then clean out the bottle and keep it for something.

I'm halfway there! How do I keep it this way and deal with throwing-away remorse? Finding balance?,"I grew up in a semi-cluttered home, not extreme hoarding, but packed with stuff we refused to throw away. For eight people, most of it was needed, but after some family losses and moving out, I inherited a small 40sqm (430sqft) apartment that had basically been a storage unit. Three couches, a double bed, too many chairs, and endless *‚Äújust in case‚Äù* furniture.

At first, I had to do extreme decluttering just to make the space livable. That turned into extreme minimalism and a fear of owning anything because I *loved* how easy it was to clean when I had nothing. Now I am back to being a normal person and owning things because I have to and because I want to, but I am struggling hard.

The small space makes it difficult to stay organized. I keep falling into the trap of buying storage solutions that never seem to work, and no matter what, there is always some clutter on every surface. The place looks clean for maybe half an hour before daily life takes over.

I also struggle with consumables, mostly cleaning supplies and cosmetics. I *love* cleaning and testing new scents and strengths, so I hoard products under the sink. Same with bathroom products. How do you clean and *not* have a spa day after? On top of that, I *love* thrifting and antiquing. I don't think it's a problem, but it definitely adds to the amount of stuff I own. Maybe slightly dopamine-decorish.

How do you handle the regret of getting rid of things, especially when they are useful but just *too much*? And how do I keep my space livable without constantly feeling like I need to reorganize? :( I feel like I'm cleaning all the time and see no results!

Don't declutter your sentimental items curate them instead,"My mother painted dozens of ceramic houses.

I don't have to keep them all--after all, she doesn't reside in her things, and I don't have to decorate how she did.  I can keep two or three of my favorites.

Likewise, when looking at my travel scrapbooks (I'm old-school here, back before smart phones when we took disposable cameras with us on our trips lol), I don't have to keep every picture of places I visited twenty years ago.  I can curate my photos and by doing so declutter by combining my scrapbooks.

"Goodbye, Things by Fumio Sasaki","Dear Fellow Declutter-er,

I hope that you try to look into reading this book (Goodbye, Things by Fumio Sasaki) to jumpstart your decluttering adventures.  
Obviously, don‚Äôt buy the book but borrow it from the library or use an app you see fit (e.g Hoopla, Libby, etc).  
This book gave me a lot of positive perspective on the impact of not having so much stuff or accumulating things. I have more fire to keep going.  While there may be some extreme examples of minimalism in this book, you must take what you want or pick and choose the best advice.  Some of Fumio‚Äôs advice might not even be attainable (e.g. not making coffee daily but instead going to a cafe).  

Some tidbits:
-Your stuff is like a roommate but you pay for their rent to be there.  
-You don‚Äôt need to stock up on stuff, the stores do that for you. 
-It‚Äôs okay if you spent a lot of money and haven‚Äôt used the item.  You‚Äôre probably not going to use it at all.  
-Your silent to-do list is effecting your mental health.  Things are ‚Äúspeaking‚Äù to you.  For example, those pants you bought that need to be hemmed‚Ä¶ either donate it or hem them! 

You got this!  Slowly but surely!  Week by week!

Digital decluttering tips:,"Here are a bunch of digital decluttering tips that are useful but not worthy of their own post. 

* WizTree can highlight the large files and folders on Windows. Go through and purge the worst offenders.

* In Google Drive, tap the ""Storage (X% full)"" bar then ""clean up space."" Google will recommend large files to delete. Google Takeout can download the entire Drive folder at once if you want to move stuff off the cloud. 

* Deciding that you don't actually plan to do a task is a valid reason to check something off your to-do list.

* Next time you're doomscrolling, scroll through old photos instead. Delete any that you don't want to keep.

* Digital storage is cheap and don't take up any physical space. Offloading files from your main device onto a backup drive is fine.

* Create a folder called ""Junk to delete later."" Whenever you make a file that you only need briefly (like downloading something to print), put it there. Purge the folder every once and a while.

* Purge your downloads folder occasionally.

* If you switch to a new notes app, take a moment to transfer only the notes that you may reference in the future. Delete the others.

* Scroll through your YouTube/social media following list and get rid of creators you are no longer interested in. This will also improve your recommendations a little.

* If you get a lot of emails from one address (marketing emails, USPS informed delivery, social notifications), you can delete/archive them all at once by typing the address into the Gmail search bar.

* Turn off notifications for most of your apps. You can open social media apps in your own time. Notifications that you want to see but aren't time sensitive can be set to silent. 

* Android temporarily disables apps you haven't used in months (Settings > Apps > Unused apps). You can probably delete all of them.

* Create a separate email account for websites that you know will send a lot of spam. Don't bother checking this one regularly.

* Use a password manager like Bitwarden to keep your passwords organized. Paprika can keep recipes organized. There are AI tools to tag and organize photos.

* Here are some places people often forgot to declutter: Desktop, downloads folder, old apps/programs, games (especially from launchers other than Steam), subscriptions, legacy media.",declutter,1740948722.0

Wake up it's the first of the month!! February reflections and March planning,"In February I finished the Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning and got rid of 100 (plus or minus) items! 

I felt pretty indifferent to the book, I know a lot of people like it which I can see why but I don't think I'm necessarily the target audience. I'm still in my early 20s and have yet to face my mortality lol but I think this will be a really good book for my parents.  I felt it was very memoir like with some good tidbits about decluttering. However, I did take away a few things that I will keep in mind/utilize. It felt like she lived quite a rich and storied life with lots of opportunities to obtain trinkets and lots of cool items that are hard to part with. She grew up with a second home in the countryside and sounds like she has a decently large family. But I think she has slowly minimized down to an apartment which I think is quite normal for a lot of seniors that I know around me as well. 

  
I also kept a running tally for the month to kind of motivate me and to keep track of what left my home. It wasn't really comprehensive I'm sure I've missed logging stuff and also a lot of small trinkets that don't take up a lot of space left. But I think they all count. One thing I've realized in February is if I don't touch something I could really consider getting rid of something. It's such a simple concept but it's so hard to implement. I was able to declutter a lot of nail polish this way. Sometimes I get really overwhelmed by options and keeping it simple helps a lot. I also threw away some ephemera of pamphlets and tour info when I went on vacation. I kept 1 thing from that pile- it was from pre COVID and of a simpler time but the information like tours and hours are outdated and I can never return back to that time. So off it went. I grieve that time period but it made so much room in my drawer. 

  
Another update to my no shopping. I know I've purchased a lot of random stuff like crafting things over the years so it's been fun to dig them back up and use them again. Another thing is that I've been cooking more at home and while the urge to buy new kitchenware is strong, I know we have everything I need. Especially cute little containers for my stuff. My parents already have a huge stash. So while everything is not new and aesthetic, we have it at home!! And I'm putting it to use. 

  
In March, I'd like to declutter another 100 items. I have a few random paper folders and drawers that I need to go through as well as the clothes and crafting stuff that I think will make me reach my goal easily. Honestly I'm thinking if these clothes I've listed for resell don't sell by the end of the month I will just donate them. I also haven't been leaving the house. I used to be out and about all the time and it would cause me to spend money. There's always something to buy! It kind of feels a little stifling to not have a place to leave to but I think I will enjoy this time and create something instead. I also plan to make a personal ""box"" like Magnusson has that instructs a family member to just chuck it just in case. I'm using my time to work out to fit into my clothes better again so I also don't have to buy new stuff. 

  
Anyways this is just a kind of brain dump, I'm really proud of myself for getting to this point and mostly emotionally detach myself. Here's to a more decluttered March! And NO SHOPPING FOR ME. ",declutter,1740890115.0

"How much is your time, energy, mental health worth?","TL;DR: When thinking about how much an item is worth - how much you spent for it, how much your could sell it for resale, how much you would be saving just in case you needed it and didn't have to re-buy it - please consider putting a value on how much your time, energy, and mental health are worth.  Because unless something is really expensive, you may be ""spending"" more to sell it (or keep it) than the item cost in the first place.

I had an epiphany the other day when faced with a closet-full of stuff I thought I wanted to sell on eBay.  This represented the last of my vintage sewing collecting phase (insanity), and the remnants of my non-functional sewing room/guest room/Hell Room. It was all packed up in boxes, ready to list but I've been procrastinating doing anything for probably 2-3 years.  Why did I want to sell it when I so obviously did NOT want to sell it?  So here goes:

There's this intrinsic value (money) we put on things - easy, that's usually the price we paid to acquire it or how much something is going for on eBay.  But what happens when we decide we don't want that thing anymore?  It's not serving us anymore, we don't really like it or care about it anymore, buying it was a mistake, etc?  Some of us can just get rid of it and move on.  But money is tight and the future is so uncertain right now!  Maybe we hope to recoup some (or all) of that money through selling.  Maybe we decide to hold onto the item ""just in case.""  Why re-buy something when you need it if you already have it?  You're saving money in the long run by not wasting it now, right?

But when we take into consideration the time that stuff represents - either the selling or the additional storage/maintenance responsibilities, how much is that stuff really worth?   Some of us already have a value we put on our time - how much are we ""worth"" per hour, usually based on our employment compensation expectations.  But women are especially bad at putting a value on their time and young people who haven't really had a decent job - what is your time value worth to you?  

Maybe you like selling, maybe it feels value-added .  If that's the case, great!  People DIY all the time.  And eBay, Poshmark, The Real Real, etc wouldn't be what they are if people weren't willing to engage in resale.

But if you take the what you can reasonably expect to get for an item second-hand (minus any selling fees) minus your time value and compare that figure to the original price you paid for your unwanted item, unless what you're trying to sell is pretty darn expensive, you may actually be ""spending"" more than the item is worth to just donate.

Ditto for keeping stuff ""just in case"" - are you leaking time?  How much shuffling are you doing in your (limited) storage areas to make it all fit?  Make it functional?  Make it manageable?  Make it memorable?  How much extra time does it take to find what you're looking for because of all the extra not-going-to-be-looking-for-it-anytime-soon stuff?  How much does this extra stuff translate into additional housework/household maintenance expectations/responsibilities?  How much aggravation is it contributing to your daily tasks?  Are we ""wasting"" time like a leaky window wastes our heating bill?

To me, you can usually get more money (or at the very least, not spend more money) but you cannot get more time - time gets ""spent"" whether we want to or not.  How we spend it, that's what matters.  Playing with your kid, learning Spanish, going to the gym, reading a book, binge-watching a show, taking a nap.  I think all of those things are a better way to spend our limited (and we don't even know HOW limited) time than trying to figure out why I should keep something, where should I put it, how I can squeeze every nickel out of it, generally fussing around with our stuff.

And how many of us actually put a cash value on our energy or our mental health?  Depending on your situation (kids, school, stressful job, financial worries, extra responsibilities/obligations, etc) your available energy reserves might be pretty limited/easily depleted.   And if you're feeling overwhelmed for any reason, your mental bandwidth might be pretty limited, too.  Like your precious time, how do you want to spend your limited energy?

Pride of ownership is real.  It is very satisfying to be in a space, tastefully decorated, surrounded by all of your favorite things.  And it is very comforting to know that you have the things you need AND the available space to do the things you want to do.  But if you feel like you are literally drowning in stuff - if your stuff is stressing you out, causing you to feel anxious or nervous, maybe even making you feel stupid or wasteful or ungrateful or a failure - how is that stuff serving you?  Is it improving you life or sucking up your vitality like a psychic vacuum?

If having extra stuff ""just in case"" actually makes you feel safer, secure, confident then go ahead and feather your nest.  

But if it's just more stuff cluttering up your mental inventory, more stuff added to your to-do list, more stuff leaching your time, energy, peace of mind - if you literally do not have the bandwidth to deal with unnecessary things (physical, electronic, scheduling, relationships), think about how much that stuff is costing you - not necessarily the cost of the item or what we could possibly recoup from the item, but the limited time, energy, executive function we expend dealing with that item.

March challenge: Paperwork and e-paperwork!,"It's the most dreaded time of the year! Time to sort paperwork, whether physical or online.

Before getting started, do three things:

* Check your country's rules for how long financial documents like tax returns need to be kept.
* Set aside a spot (box, tray, email folder) for documents you need for filing taxes.
* Set aside a spot (box, tray, email folder) for documents you need to deal with ASAP.

Your goal is to keep only:

* Documents you actually need for real financial, legal, and health purposes. 
* Documents that require action soon (payments needed, checks to deposit, receipts for returns. etc.).
* Manuals for things you actually own, if you prefer paper manuals.
* Meaningful sentimental items like letters or cards, which are kept *separately,* in a keepsake box.

How you store useful documents is up to you. Many people like scanning. Many people like to go paperless for bills and set up auto-payments. The important thing is that you can find your long-term needed documents, and you can act on your short-term action items.

Putting photos into digitally made photo book (such as Snapfish)?,"I plan to digitize some photos but want to keep some in the physical world that I can look through. I was thinking it may be more manageable to make 1- 3 snapfish/mixbook/shutterfly photo books than to keep the originals in photo boxes or a photo album, potentially saving space (?) and organizing them so that when I look through old photos it isn‚Äôt overwhelming. If I went with this plan, I would have the digitized copies, a thin 20-page book or two, and keep about 10 in their original form as well. (I would then have 3 copies of whatever I choose as the 10 most valuable and have salient holdable photos when I‚Äôm older).

Success story: junk journalling with papers collected from travel,"I love to travel, and I often bring home brochures, receipts, tickets, etc. as souvenirs. But my collection had been getting out of hand, making it hard to go through when I wanted to reminisce. So when someone I follow on YouTube (Sojournies) posted a video about their travel junk journal, I thought it was such a neat idea. 

One week, one journal, most of a glue stick, and a whole lot of washi tape later, I was successfully able to contain my collection and present it beautifully. I cut out parts of brochures I wanted to display or use as backdrops, recycling what I didn't use, and laying out everything flat on the journal pages made the resulting stack more compact. I store my journal in the same box that I kept the paper collection, and there's much more room in there now.

And it was such a fun, creative project. With the brochures and other handouts beautifully designed by professionals, the pages look really nice without a ton of effort. Really proud of what I made!",declutter,1740805125.0
I need ideas for a 7' by 7' kitchenette.,"I live in a small one bedroom apartment with a tiny 7 foot by 7 foot 'kitchen' that has full sized fridge and stove, a double sink, and small cupboards. I guess I'm lucky that at one end, I have a window.

I also love to cook, and have a variety of pots and pans.  I have pared down to one of each type. I have enough dishes for two. I used ikea rails on three walls to hang pots and pans.  I have two appliances on the counter - airfryer, which I use at least 3x a week, and a cheap espresso machine.  I also have a shelf unit outside the kitchen for other appliances and pantry stapes - flour, rice, salt, pasta.  My microwave is on top of the fridge. I use a Kallax 2X2 in the dining room as a sideboard, and it holds a lot.  I also have a narrow portable dishwasher that acts as my main countertop, as the others flank the stove and sink.

But no matter what I do, it gets cluttered immediately.  It drives me MAD.  I have ADHD and compensate as best I can but it makes me crazy.

"Am I hoarding, or am I being reasonable?","Hello Everyone,

I have a ton of hobbies and two of them are repairing/ modifying electronics, making custom audio, and electronic cables, and sewing.  What's great is I'm able to reuse a lot of things that are broken and I can save money, but on the other hand I accumulate a lot of ""spare parts"" instead of tossing things.

For example, I like making bags and backpacks, so if I have an old bag I deconstruct it to individual parts and save the zippers, pulls, handles, lining and buckles. Same with electronics, if something breaks I usually desolder and save the batteries, wires, cables, etc.. 

Some of the individual parts can be expensive like YKK zipper pulls, cordura fabric, stretch lining. But I'm getting in my head about how I'm just hoarding all these things instead of throwing them away. 

A lot of decluttering has to do with ""closing your eyes"" and throwing things that could be replaceable, but I feel like it's a waste when I can save parts for different uses.

Update: Lots of great advice here and some that I've used in the past for organization like the ""Container Method"" mentioned here. 

I have 1 drawer for soldering tools, ppe, extra components and I've organized them by type in divided bins. Additionally, I have 1 large bin in my garage with extra computer parts. 

For sewing, fabrics,  and all extra parts are stored in a 19L waterproof bin I store underneath my sewing machine with threads + equipment in smaller bins in a cabinet. With 1 extra sewing machine in my garage. 

I'm still going through some introspection of what to toss and what to keep, but I did throw away all my bread boards that I've never used and I'll probably toss colored thread I'll never use either.  It's progress, but I feel like this may be a ""look inside myself"" moment",declutter,1740772929.0

"Friday 15: Handbags, wallets, backpacks, etc.!","It's time to take a look at things you use to carry around money and other helpful items. Start with the item you're actively using, then see if you're up for the rest. 

**In the carrier you're actively using:**

* Remove old receipts (trash or file, depending on your preference), crushed mints or crackers you saved from a restaurant, ticket stubs for events that are now past, used-up mini containers of hand lotion or sanitizer, the lipstick you kind of hate, small stuff you bought and never put away, and the layer of change that sinks to the bottom (don't throw out the change!).
* Clean it out. If it's in poor condition, switch to a back-up and get rid of this bag.
* Put back the things you actively use and need, neatly.

**For bags and packs as a whole, say goodbye to:**

* The bag that always does something incredibly annoying (falls open, falls off your shoulder, straps too short, pockets the wrong size). Quiet meditation on the closet shelf will not heal it.
* The bag in poor condition that you've already bought a back-up for.
* The everyday bag that you haven't used in over a year.
* The bag that's a great color, brand, style, whatever, but you always put it back because it doesn't quite work with your outfit or life.
* The bag that's a ""just in case we ever..."" but the last time we did, you reached for something else and did fine.

Shifting my mindset: our house is enough,"I've been on a massive declutter after basically having a meltdown in January. I was so ashamed of my house and how I could never have anyone over. When I was a kid, I was always so upset that we couldn't have people over because of living in a hoarder house. And then found myself in basically the same situation--my house was too cluttered, which made it really, really hard to actually clean, and then I was too ashamed to have people over. Someone told me in one of my mom groups that my kids deserved better. And that hit hard. They were right!

My husband and I kept saying, ""We need to move! We don't have enough room for all of this stuff!"" One day, though, I said, ""Families make it work in tiny apartments and we have a 3 bedroom house. We should be able to make this work.""

I got rid of serving stuff since we haven't hosted much now that I have 2 toddlers.

I got rid of 12 wine glasses; my husband and I don't drink. I still have 8 that need to go.

I got rid of SEVENTY toys/sets of toys.

I got rid of all the hand-me-downs my siblings forced on me that I would have to store for a decade before it would be useful for my kids.

I got rid of all the cleaning supplies I keep around because I spent money on them and always tell myself I NEED to use them (but I never did).

I got rid of the stupid amount of stained throw pillows in my living room. Toddlers and throw pillows aren't a great mix.

I got rid of the brand new, unopened carpet cleaner we've had sitting in my husband's office for 5 years (we don't have carpet anymore).

Most importantly, I got rid of the idea that I needed more space for my stuff. I needed less stuff for my space. My kids deserve to have space to play. They deserve to not be stressed in their own home. They deserve to be able to have play dates here. They deserve a home that is catered to them and their needs and not the spacial needs of STUFF.",declutter,1740721850.0
My mom won't let me live with her if my room doesn't look minimal (she is afraid of the house looking like a horders place) please help me out reddit,"How does someone turn a maximalist vibe into a minimalistic one? 
I'm getting rid of what I can do without, but that won't help much, I just need a way to hide it, or at least make it seem like I don't have as many things as I do. I only have a bedroom with a small very small closet. 
Do you guy's have any advice on how to utilize my space? What should I buy, or do? 
I'm 19 trying to get my own place, but until I do I need to survive living with my mom.

Okay so for context/rant: My parents moved far from my school, so I had to live with my grandparents for 4 years. When I turned 18 my dad divorced mom and I was still living with my grandparents. All of my things have been scattered across my family, I've been trying to bring all if it back to one place for 2 years. Some of it was in storage, but my dad waited to long to pay the bill. Stuff from storage spread from my grandparents garage to my dad's work warehouse, and all over the place again. For 3 years alot of my ameadit things like clothes and prized possessions where scattered between my mom's place, and my grandparents place. At my grandparents place I've been using the guest room that had been used as a extra storage room,  so most of my stuff has nowhere to go in there. At my mom's place I have my own room that has only my thing's in it, so I've been trying to move everything into there. 
HERE IS WHERE IT GETS COMPLICATED- my mom requires me to have a license, and car to live with her (I've been fixing up my dad's old car that will be mine, and I'll be getting my license soon) ,but she also recently added that it can't look like a horders place. Probably because my grandparents are horders and lots of drama between them, it doesn't help that it's my dad's grandparents so they have issues, aswell as they are horrid people to begin with. I understand not wanting the house to look like a horders place, but it's a downsize to what we had 4 years ago. I'm 19 and getting a job, so I can find my own place (because noone in my family is good to live with) and I can't do that with my grandparents since they are more toxic than my mom. Living with her will help me be closer to jobs and she will actually Want me to get a job and get out. She fears that I will make it a horders situation, even though I told her several times it won't, I'll keep it clean, and that everything that's mine will stay in my room always until I get my own place. She wouldn't care if all my stuff stays in my room though because if it's apart of our small apartment, and if she can see it, she will be upset. Now here is my problem here, I love my stuff, and I like to decorate like a maximalist or like a jungle vibe with my plants and everything witch core, dnd, anime, gaming, books, Manga, stuffed animals, shiny things that I collect! all the awsome hobbies I have! making my room the Escape and safe space I want! That's the issue though, I have to find a way to make everything turn into a minimalist type view at least a way to make it seem like it at least but idk where to look or start reddit please help me, I'm just trying to make with what I got, then move out as soon as I can.

Thoughts on buying a desk for my 1 bedroom apartment for work?,"I have been decluttering for a few months now and it‚Äôs been fantastic. My living space is almost optimized just dealing with clothes now primarily aside from some stragglers to take care of in the next week or so for my annual super deep clean. 

Anyway I got promoted and do some work from home now sometimes.. I was using my dining room table but between work and personal stuff I find the table becoming cluttered constantly with loose papers and my blood pressure monitor etc.. I was thinking about buying a medium sized desk with some drawers. And using the desk and drawers to hold work items and some personal items like blood pressure monitor and documents. Do you think this will hurt my decluttering ambitions? Will this desk be better off in my dining room which doesn‚Äôt have a ton of room to spare or my living room which has some space but I prefer the dining room for natural light and better thinking vibes, plus to separate relaxation and work. Bedroom is 100% out of the question. If I buy the desk and chair, to compensate I would likely declutter an end table or something to help counter the new furniture.

Final Declutter done at this house,"We finally got the green light to move, and today was the final day to get trash into the garbage before we moved, so I decluttered the pantry.

Making progress with my parents' cluttered house,"My parents moved to an apartment near me, so their cluttered and under-maintained house is now empty of people but still full of stuff. I've started the long decluttering process, but it will take ages because I don't live nearby. Yesterday, I hired people from task rabbit remotely to clean out the basement, which is now empty, which is wonderful.

My to-do list with their house that goes like this:

1. Fix anything that comes up, which is so far: gutters, trees, toilet internal parts, pipe under kitchen sink. Pest control came because the neighbors had mice but didn't find anything, thankfully.
2. Check structure is sound and fix any structural issues. Update the lead water service line. (Update: I already have the structural engineer's plans ready to go and the basement is completely empty, so full foundation is visible and repair could start tomorrow in theory.)
3. Declutter house in reverse order of how often the rooms were used: less used rooms means nearly everything can be thrown out without sorting.
4. Update electricity, install air conditioning, update kitchen and bathrooms.

I'm starting to doubt the order of 2 and 3. There is a literal ton or two of extra weight in the house, and it seems like it might make a difference to the structural repairs, although it's pretty clear that the wood supports have had enough. Should I stick with this plan or try to get rid of more dead weight before the contractors do this major construction on the house's foundation?

Update 2: I spoke with the structural engineer and decided not to do the expensive foundation repair at this point. The main repair is replacing 120 year old wooden beams with steel, which is probably more necessary due to the large numbers of books and my father's huge amount of paper files, but probably had to be done anyhow. We'll clean up the brick foundation from inside the basement. The more extensive foundation repair involves digging a trench around the whole house in order to waterproof the outside of the house, something they couldn't do 120 years ago when the foundation was first built, but that is more costly and disruptive than I can manage. He's adjusting the plan to leave open the option of the major repair at a later point. He didn't mention the clutter as an obstacle. At some later point when the upper floors are clear, it's possible there would need to be structural work upstairs if I want to change the layout, but that basement beam is the most important structural feature.",declutter,1740498709.0

I can see my floor!! (10 years in the making),"For the first time in the 10 years I‚Äôve lived in this apartment when my family had to downsize there Is a clear pathway around my room and NO OBSTACLES AND PILES. I started with not being able to see my floor to stuff thrown in boxes and stacked, to smaller piles being formed, and now I see the light at the end of the tunnel. I just have a couple bags of stuff that need to go and then my floor will finally be clear and not used as storage. I used to fight so much as a teen about wanting a bigger space to accommodate all my things but I think about how I want to live a more nomadic lifestyle/move out and having all these things wasn‚Äôt conducive to that goal. I‚Äôve been reading and re reading Marie Kondos book and I finally tapped into the sentimental part of my brain and got over the emotional aspect of decluttering. I also got serious and accepted the fact I really need to downsize for the amount of space I have and went from a queen to a double and now a twin which opened up so much floor space that was being unused and I got rid of furniture that was a bit too bulky and originally for a bigger room. 

of course I‚Äôm not finished yet, I still have to organize my shelves and closet. theres still bags of clothes that need to be sold/donated and I know I can declutter even more stuff in this room but it feels so good to finally be able to enjoy my room. I should have done this even 5 years ago but I wasn‚Äôt ready for it. yes I‚Äôm an adult that lives with their parents. Im trying to change that and I think I just took the first step to make that process easier for me. 

some things I think really helped was first to STOP SHOPPING. I have a stash of many different things that i now have to use up (my environmental science degree is really not helping the guilt) which I feel a sort of obligation to make sure most of it doesn‚Äôt end up in the landfill. I do throw things out but I also do heavily use my local buy nothing page, try to sell things, and make sure my things go somewhere it‚Äôll have a chance at a second life. I did the emotional work and realized I was using shopping as a bandaid for a myriad of issues. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I still love shopping but finding the root cause of impulsive shopping really curbed me bringing a lot of junk and knickknacks back with me. 

I don‚Äôt buy souvenirs unless I know it can serve a dual purpose (aka it‚Äôs something I needed but now it‚Äôs in a cool design) or clothes shopping (unless I really need an item). I recently took a trip with a friend and I took only 1 checked luggage. I did purchase a few things but I brought clothes to wear and took advantage of the laundry room in the hotel. When I came back all the things reintegrated with all my other things smoothly whereas before I had shipped things back which the postage probably cost more than what the actual items I sent back were even worth and things lived in boxes and on the floor before I either decluttered them or I crammed them somewhere. 

The next steps I‚Äôll take is to deal with the insane amount of hobby stuff I have as well as clothes. I love clothes but I would love to have a more capsule like wardrobe.

How to declutter when you know you will some day move in a bigger place ?,"Hello,

I currently live in an apartment (645 sq ft). I will move out once my partner has finished his studies. We want to buy a house one day or at least live in a bigger space. 

I've been decluttering my apartment for a year and a half and have done most of the work. I store things in boxes in my cellar that i haven't used since living in an apartment but i still have that idea it will be useful once we have a bigger living space (notably anything for an outside space, which i used to have before my partner went back to school and we moved closer to his college). But that's only speculation since i have no idea what kind of place we'll live in and if I'll really want to use those things.

My question is for people in my case or who have lived it : how do you differentiate between clutter and ""futur useful objects""? I find it difficult to judge and really look into the future like that.

Thanks !",declutter,1740418871.0

what to do with deceased artist's art,"Edit: Thank you all for your advice. I've read all the comments, I'm sorry I couldn't respond to everyone. 


My MIL passed away and we're clearing out her house. Estate sale is schedule for end of April. She was an artist who focused on quantity and didn't sell much. Over 1K pieces combined of pottery and 2D art. 

What are we going to do with what is left over? We've all taken what we want. There might be a few pieces more, here and there,, but for the most part, we're done picking out what we want (which amounts of about .1% percent of her belongings)

Because I'm a fellow artist, and because I took charge on clearing out her studio (with numerous friends' help), I'm stressed that I'm going to get saddled with doing something with all the art. I want to throw it all in the dumpster, I'm so pissed right now. I don't want to spends 100s more hours photographing her artwork and turning it into a book, as a friend of theirs suggested. I don't want to find places to sell. I want to be 100% done with dealing with her belongings when the house goes on the market. I'm tired of being responsible for anything regarding my MIL. 

How do I politely tell the family ""No"", that I'm not taking this on, and it's time for me to be done. None of them want the art either, and none of them want her stuff in their home (they are insanely picky and extremely minimalist). Maybe I just shouldn't say anything, and if they ask, I politely say no, I'm not the best person for the job? I don't know how to photograph artwork, and I just don't have the cycles for this. I'm burned out.

Edit also to clarify: The reason I say it's ironic in the title is that I'm looking at drinking the tea as a _good_ thing when I'm sick, ie certain types are better for your immune system... or at least relieving symptoms, making it a question of which tea to drink.

"Taking my first leap into proper decluttering, any advice to share?","Well, hello there everyone. I do hope anyone reading this is doing well in their lives and living spaces. Courtesy out of the way, I suppose I'll get to the bulk of it all, forgive me in advance for the written clutter.

I live in a pretty compact 2 bedroom apartment, with anywhere from 3 to 5 bodies sleeping here at a time. In my thirties after a decade of time adopting some family into my care for their sake. (And eventually my own, after I realized the good it did for me.)

I believe I keep myself fairly organized, but I am also damned with my mother's clutter and hoarding bug, as well as have an aversion to simply throwing away what can better serve it's purpose in someone else's hands. I have myself far more coordinated, and even recently picked up a few nice wooden bowls secondhand that I use for dropzones of my daily clutter, except that's doing nothing to help me with the cheap plastic drawers I still have in the house, holding the amalgamations of spare tech, soldering, household, writing... uhh... Crochet needles... bike tubes... lightbulbs...A label printer.  
  
I'm sure anyone reading can tell I was looking through the plastic and eyeballing stuff without a dedicated home. I did have some success using heavy duty ziplocks to sort of bundle things together, like everything to do from glue/tape to command strips and zipties all in one big bag I can get to. I have sorted these bags into large bins each labeled in a generalized sense. ""Tools I use very infrequently goes in the tools box"" kinda deal. But I find myself shuffling them around, pulling the bag out, putting it to use, and then in the assumption that I'll need it or something out of those bags, they find their way into the clutter drawers again. So I am attempting to add some midway storage like open topped cheap plastic basket bin things I can store out of sight, but can still access or shuffle items into and out of.

Then the matter of my small kitchen, my cabinets are tiny, terribly sized for things like lazy susans and stuff like that in terms of my little spice cabinet, and I have 4 drawers all above each other that are only 8"" across. Not a lot of workable space when I'm cooking meals to serve a household, or when I make bulk meals to setup in the freezer for anyone to grab and cook in a hurry. I also have a moderate stockpile of cans setup on a wire rack to keep from making a compact dust and bug space in these worn out cabinets, I'm tempted to find some vertical stacking solutions, but most look like they would just take more space to turn the cans sideways on a fancy rack, while already being on a rack, so I have resorted to stacking them in scary ways and picking them off the floor at least once or twice a month.

Appliances, I've got 2 sizes of snow cooker, one was a gift, a small rice cooker, a quality blender, one of those cheep griddles I can probably do without now that I think about it, a big turkey cooker that I often keep in storage until the holidays or cooking for a family thing that never happens, a combo microwave/convection oven, and a dinky little toaster. the common use cases shelved under my microwave in it's own spot, and the uncommon ones stored away pretty well.

Under my sinks I keep cleaning stuff to a minimum, and keep them in their own bins, one with niche body hygiene and dog grooming needs.

And my tiny linen closets have a reduced amount of blankets, bed sheets and stuff, a bunch of white rags dedicated for cleaning, and colored rags for anything body related. I did have a lot of the extra bedding in vacuum bags, but in the midst of it all, the blankets and bags are still in the closet, just separate, for whatever reason.

I will admit, I've got a lot of stuff, and I draw the line between stuff and needs as plainly as I can. I can't say the same for everyone else here, as we each have our own clutter, and I find myself spending the energy tending to theirs, as the guardian and head of household, can't get teenagers to keep their desks clean no matter how expensive the computer they have sitting on it, and I can't really force them to respect the efforts to keep things tidy when my systems aren't readily accommodating for them to follow with less effort. They need a blanket out of the vacuum seal bag, but don't want to get the vacuum out of the closet 15 feet away to re-seal it, and just end up squirrel packing the lightly squeezed bag into the closet, kinda deal.

So to try and summarize. I'm just one guy here trying to accommodate for the kids I've raised into young adults, while setting an example on how to do it. As well as trying to keep myself orderly. I'm too empathetic and too broke to just be throwing things away, and I do have a habit of buying things I often don't need until I absolutely do. So far I'm trying to get myself into a system of storage that respects the need for something, and how readily I should have it available, while trying to readily store and remove things left unused.

If you got this far and have any advice, I would readily appreciate it.",declutter,1740166549.0

Friday 15: Outerwear!,"Take a look at coats, snow boots, gloves, hats, and similar -- items you only wear for going out of the house. It's time to say goodbye to:

* Boots that are meant to be waterproof but in fact leak.
* Gloves and mittens with holes.
* The coat that you already bought a replacement for, so you always wear the replacement.
* The coat you avoid in favor of wearing layers of sweaters.
* The coat you haven't worn in years and wouldn't bother digging out if the occasion for it happened.
* The winter hat that makes your head itch.
* The summer hat that annoys you past bearing every time you wear it.
* Anything else that doesn't fit (and won't any time soon), is damaged, doesn't do what it's supposed to do, or fills you with loathing.

Things in reasonably good shape can be donated. Non-functional items like leaky boots need to be thrown out. What goes back in your coat closet should be items you will gladly wear when the occasion for them arises -- and the occasion should be fairly likely.

Apartment has been overrun with clutter for years,"Just a warning, this post may get lengthy. I apologize in advance and appreciate anyone who rides it out! I could use words of encouragement and maybe some helpful advice to get through this.

I'll start with a bit of my back story. Growing up my bedroom was usually quite messy. Nothing too outrageous just mostly clothes, knickknacks and maybe a handful of cups on my desk (Hey, they saved the day during the infamous box spring fire incident!).. but there was the pathway through like some sort of labyrinth, you know the drill. Path to the bed, to the desk and maybe the window area. My mom, who was usually fairly neat and tidy, would get and/or help me to do a full clean once in a while, but it would always inevitably deteriorate to the high level clutter.

Fast forward to me being 23 and not really knowing what to do with myself. I eventually opted to attend a job corps program and ended up living on campus for almost a year. Some surreal, crazy experiences during that chapter of my life.. anyway.. During that time, we did a weekly deep clean of our rooms / areas (typically 4 beds/closets per room with a bathroom attached) and were expected to keep our area fairly tidy. I excelled at this for the most part, for whatever reason. There were other students who would have to remove their mattress and dig out 100 food wrappers every week. I guess the trash aspect of clutter was never really my thing and I had less clothes than ever, so it was not all that hard of a transition to keep up with it.

Eventually I graduated after fast tracking the end of my schooling after having met my first wife and we moved in together directly after. My life devolved into chaos for several years. Oh yes there was clutter. There were a lot of things, mostly negative, I don't need to delve into. I'll just say it's easy to have zero clutter when you're homeless. We eventually separated and I made the difficult transition to being on my own in my own place for the first time ever. We had found a landlord willing to work with us, and had gotten our lives somewhat on track. But then she walked out and I was left with all the bills and rent. My car I was using to get to 2 jobs broke down on the highway so I junked it on the spot as the transmission let out and there was no way I could afford to tow it anywhere and fix it. This meant I had to leave one of the jobs that was a much further commute and the single job wasn't cutting it. Lost internet, fell behind on rent. It wasn't pretty. I was quite depressed and in a bad place because of the situation.

Then a friend I had made at job corps offered to be room mates and we found a new place together and I started turning my life back around again. I kept my room similar to how it had been in job corps, with a few slight liberties but no clutter. I used a hamper and mostly everything had its place. I was even getting into the best shape of my life. Then I met my now wife. That was almost 8 years ago. We have our differences but I love her and generally life isn't too bad.

But the clutter.. the clutter is the worst I've dealt with in my life. It's not hoarder stacks or anything, but it's taken over several big areas of our apartment. We have a dining room area attached to the kitchen we have nick named ""the abyss"" because it's where things go that we aren't currently using to be forgotten. Our bedroom is worse. Two corners are (were, we'll get to that) stacked with various random items. Clothes, cards, knickknacks, gadgets, you name it it's probably there in some form of iteration. The wall connecting said corners has our 2 dressers along it that we can't really access.. and more clutter draped over them like some sort of clutter blanket. We just have like 3 totes of all our clothes in front of the dressers that we dig through for clothing when we need. Ashamed to say a good portion of it ends up on the floor around the totes and ends up getting walked on. We have several cats so if I see a lot of hair I know it's likely a floor item due for rewashing.

So in the recent past I have tried picking at the clutter, mainly in the abyss. I have tried hacking at it and wearing it down like some boss fight that you need to pace yourself for. It just always grows back. I'll clear the table and it will be clear for a few days and then suddenly it's just covered again. I feel like I know exactly what needs to be done I just can't find the motivation for it. Until today. I have been wanting a new desk for my computer setup so I can start using a two monitor setup, but currently there wouldn't really be space for a larger desk. My desk is in a corner of the bedroom that hasn't been devoured by clutter, but the free space around it requires a shift in the furniture to accommodate a larger desk or even a new location on another wall. This is impossible with the clutter taking up basically half of the bedroom. So today I tackled a corner. It has a door near that has not been fully swung open since within a year of moving in. The floor hasn't been revealed in years. There were items from 6+ years ago. I got most of the corner cleared. A good little square of clear floor space. Three full trash bags removed and tossed.

I need encouragement because I was quite proud of this progress, but my wife didn't make a very big deal of it. I know she's been dealing with a lot, but I was hoping for a bit more of a reaction. It was a solid 2 hours of grueling decluttering. It may not seem like very much time, but it definitely doesn't help that I have pretty severe dust allergies.. and it's somewhat depressing work even though it's progress. I am going to keep tackling new spots and make sure they don't fall back until the place is under control.

I know most of the tips and ideas. Limit things being brought in unless they have a necessary purpose or use. Let go of things being kept just for the sake of being kept. I mean let's face it, if we haven't seen or thought of these things in years, they're probably not that important in the grand scheme of things. Not that it's always the case. I unearthed some of our wedding memorabilia, which obviously didn't get tossed, but a large % of what I uncovered did. Make and keep routines that involve cleaning / decluttering to make it habitual and keep it from becoming a massive daunting task. Make homes for things and stick to keeping things ""home."" I get at my wife about this. In all our years here I have misplaced my wallet perhaps once, and I don't even recall specifically, because I always keep it in the same spot in our bedroom. Her on the other hand, not to put her down but she has lost hers more than I can remember. It could be in any of a dozen locations, or somewhere else entirely for whatever reason. She just gets upset whenever I bring up that she should have a dedicated spot for it. Any advice on this would be appreciated.

I am focused and motivated to get it under control and I know it will be hours upon hours of work to get there. I plan on doing a few per day here and there until it's done.. at the same time it is hard to keep it from growing back while I am not keeping at it. I guess because my approach has often been to organize and move around the clutter, rather than actually taking care of it. Sweeping it under the rug, so to speak. But I intend to actually get rid of a large portion of it now, and find means of organizing and homing the rest.

I apologize again for the massive wall of text, but I felt the need for some sort of outlet and this community has seemed to be very empathetic and helpful from what I've browsed and seen recently. Hoping to eventually see some light at the end of this tunnel.",declutter,1740113330.0

Digital video/audio project decluttering,"I am very much in over my head with digital clutter and desperately need advice.

A little about me: I am 29 and I've been making random little music and video projects since I was 14. I have AuDHD and over time I have amassed a ridiculous amount of files, some organized and some not, but a large majority of them are important in some way. I have a 2Tb hard drive that has about 1.3Tb full right now - some of these files are photos, but a big chunk of them are video and audio files.

I am an artist and musician, but I also have a day job and making music is something I do as a creative hobby. Regardless, it's my passion and I am extremely attached to the things I make. Unfortunately, because I work and have limited time to do hobbies, I rarely actually finish anything I start. I also have a bad habit of recording large durations of video/audio on my phone without labeling them, leading to hundreds of hours of unlabeled digital content.

My biggest issue regarding my file collection is that I have no way to assess which files are important without sitting down and watching/listening to all of them. I write original songs, but for many of the songs I've written the only known recording I have is lost somewhere within a random unnamed video/audio files on this massive drive. Additionally, I am trans and started medically transitioning on testosterone 3 years ago, so I have recorded a ridiculous amount of videos documenting my progress as a singer. These videos and audios are very sentimental to me, but I know they are mixed in with many files that include bad takes or multiple recordings of the same thing.

This problem is also my motivation to declutter my massive collection, but it just feels impossible to actually accomplish and maintain. I know I need to be better about labeling files when I create them, but I haven't found a system that actually works that I can stick to. I've tried having ""MASTER"" file folders, but then I end up making multiple ""MASTER"" folders in different locations which defeats the purpose.

I've tried automating the process by using the Everything program, using batch file labeling software, etc. This has helped quite a bit with my photos specifically, but the videos are another issue entirely. With photos, I can open one up and instantly identify what it is and whether it's important. But with videos and audio, I feel the need to sit and listen to each one and compare it with every other version to decide which is the best recording I have of any given song.

I'm so sick and tired of not being able to find what I'm looking for when I want it. I've made amazing projects in Audacity or Shortcut that I'm really proud of, only to be unable to locate them later. I've written so many songs that have been lost in the sea of files. I have no way of easily accessing my best work; therefore, it feels like it's lost forever.

I'm going to call this experiment a success.

My biggest goal was to use up ingredients, and that worked great. Off the top of my head I finished several small portions of meat, bread and veggies from my freezer. Most of my half empty bags of rice, beans and pasta are gone. Lots of odds and ends are gone.

I threw some 3-12 month old bags of random veggies in a casserole just to see what would happen. Most of that went in the bin but it was still dinner. This was my first freestyle casserole so I can add that skill to my cooking toolkit now.

**What I bought:**

Week 1: The only pantry goods I bought were corn syrup and cereal to make cereal bars. The rest was meat and veggies.

Week 2: A few ingredients for sauces and a big chub of meat because it was on sale. Oops. This week had about $30 in veggies, none of which got tossed surprisingly.

**Permanent changes:**

This experiment changed how I shop for the better.

First, I started checking the pantry and freezer the day before my shopping run. This gives me plenty of time to plan out meals that use what I have on hand.

Second, I realized just how often I was buying ingredients because they looked good and not because I have plans for them.

Moving Way from game collecting,"I've been a gamer since I was 5 years old, and a collector all my adult life. 

Over the last couple of years, I've felt my priorities begin to change. It started with me knuckling down over 2 years, working extra jobs, cutting out all unnecessary purchases and reducing my outgoings to the bare minimum. This allowed me to clear 18k worth of debt and I'm now completely debt free :) 

For the first couple of months, I treated myself to a couple of games that I've always wanted, but to be honest, they just didn't hit the same. 

During my 2 years of being extra frugal, I took up running and am now working on reaching 100 half marathons (18 in the bag as of today) I'd love to travel more, meet new people (I have a very small social circle) and basically do more with my life than sit around playing video games. 

This is a major adjustment for me, as gaming has been such a big part of my life for so long now (I'm 36 this year!) but I'm now at the stage where I want to start parting with my video game collection. 

To start this off, the first thing I did was go through all my games and identify the games I have no interest in playing (I honestly used to buy games with the idea of getting a ""Full set"" for each console. Thanks YouTube for the monkey see, monkey do game collector videos... üòÖ), or games that I have already finished and I know I won't play again. These can either go on eBay if they are worth anything or go to charity if they are only worth a couple of ¬£'s. 

As I'm currently having a ""Quiet"" year to put some savings behind me, I've turned clearing the rest of the games into a bit of a challenge... I want to practice gratitude so am playing through the games I have, taking the time to appreciate them, and then saying goodbye when I've finished them. This won't be a quick process but the number is slowly reducing every week. Having this focus also stops me from going out and spending money, chasing that dopamine hit.... And in a way, every game I finish, I can then sell... It's a bit like being paid to play video games (at least thats what I'm telling myself!) 

Any other game collectors / ex-game collectors who've been through or are currently going through a similar situation of decluttering their collections? 

This is a really big thing for me, as I have an addictive personality so need to make sure I don't slip back into buying games for that dopamine hit, or end up replacing the addiction with something else! 

Any advice / tips would be much appreciated, thanks! üòÑ",declutter,1739745803.0
"Make a dent in the mess, before the mess makes a dent in you.","Sometimes it feels like the clutter i have in my life is eroding my enjoyment of daily life. 

The more I chip away at the clutter, the more freedom I feel to move unbridled by the responsibility to maintain all these extra things. 

Kind of a simple way to put it, but this thought popped into my head the other day. It made me feel empowered that I can take control over how much I carry along the life that I live.

How to declutter ‚Ä¶. With young kids,"We have four young kiddos including a three month old. Oldest is seven. We don't have a tiny house but it's not big either for the number of us. For a while we were managing the clutter decently, but with the chaos of a new baby it just feels overwhelming. 

I am at the point where I don't even know where to start. It feels like any extra energy or time we have goes to just managing the status quo - laundry, dishes, surface cleaning. I also struggle in particular with decluttering kid stuff as we have such a range of ages. I don't like getting rid of toys that one or more kids liked because I want it to be there for the younger one(s). This leads to a lot of stuff being around. We are pretty scrupulous about toys and we do sell/donate items fairly regularly, but it seems like we can't keep up.

A lot of our clutter is just art supplies, artwork, art and craft and lego and toy projects finished and ongoing, junk toys from school (think tiny erasers, little plastic dinosaurs, etc.). The kids get quite attached to these things and I don't know how to purge them. Often I take things to the basement and if they aren't looked for in a month or two I get rid of them. 

Families with young kids, how do you manage all the clutter? How do you balance having toys and supplies and stuff on hand to play with and be creative with - with keeping your house organized and decluttered? How do you honor nostalgia but not keep everything your kids make or like?",declutter,1739738234.0
Under the bathroom sink,"It‚Äôs been calling to me for a while, it‚Äôs such a mess under there. A bottle of something leaked and there was blue goo everywhere so I finally had no choice.

I pulled everything out first. Found a *lot* of old shampoos and conditioners that I wouldn‚Äôt use again. Gone. 

Moved to cleaning supplies. Couldn‚Äôt find the offending blue goo bottle. Got rid of a bunch of random shit that was hiding in a back corner that I didn‚Äôt even know existed.

"rant, and why I declutter","I've only posed a few times, but almost everytime is about my MILs estate. She had a large house and worked very hard to fill it up. She was trending towards hoarder, and her art studio would officially classify as a hoarder situation. 

So far, it's taken 72 man hours to clean out the studio, to the point where the only stuff left is finished art, books, and trash. 

I'm so grateful for having friends who showed up to help. Many hands makes light work in this case. Repeatedly, they showed up week after week to help me go through everything and salvage what can be saved, make donations, arrange for pickup, everything. 

Tomorrow the dumpster arrives to take care of all the rest of the trash, and then the studio will be empty, save the finished artwork that the family still has to sort through.

This has been a horrendous and harrowing experience. The house itself has cabinets and shelves on almost every wall except the hallway. Every time her house filled up, she'd buy another piece of furniture to store more stuff. She built on 3 new rooms to extend the storage capacity. If she had lived 5 more years, the rest of the house would've become a hoarder issue, like the studio had become. 

She used to say that she's just going to ""leave us a match"" as a way to detach from the mess she left behind. Gawd that's so inconsiderate and selfish. And her friends would laugh right along with her and encourage her. It's so effing awful. She just didn't care what mess she was leaving us. It's so hard to not lose my S$%#. 

It's so awful y'all. I know you understand, which is why I'm posting here. It's the only place I can post without others saying I'm ""calling her out and being disrespectful"". 

When I talk about how I feel, so many people want me to not be angry with her. They try to explain why she was that way, I'm so sick of it. I'm tired of people trying to ""correct"" how I feel. I assume that anyone who jokes, like she did, or tries to correct my feelings has never had to do this before. 

I just don't want to do this to anyone who is left behind after I die. This is so awful. I already had to do this exact same thing with my mother's home (who had the same problem), and now I have to do it again. It's hard to contain my anger.

Learning a lot through this process,"I've always struggled to get rid of things, or to change in general, and this is the first big cleanout I've really done. I've been learning a lot in the process. Some things that I've learned:

* Getting rid of the thing doesn't mean getting rid of the memory. I clung to so many old things because they brought up good memories for me. And it's great to keep things that are themselves the thing I have fond memories of - I'm not going to get rid of my favorite childhood stuffed animal for example. But saying goodbye to an old tattered college shirt I can't fit into any more is not me saying goodbye to the good memories I had at college. I've been photos of things before I donate them to help preserve memories and that makes me feel a lot better.
* Keeping something that I know I won't use isn't doing anyone any favors. If I know I won't ever do this craft project, keeping it in my house just makes me feel bad and guilty. If I know I won't ever read this book, it's just taking up space on my bookshelf.
* It helped me a lot to find places where my stuff is wanted. You can google ""your town"" + recycling to see what's locally available. I found a local charity that uses donated books to help struggling youth, and I was able to bring myself to do a big closet cleanout when I found a donation bin for clothing going to refugees. A big problem for me is craft supplies and finding a local creative reuse center has been a godsend.
* I didn't want to be super wasteful and go through a ton of paper towels so I bought a pack of microfiber towels and they're awesome. They can handle just about any surface and can be thrown in the wash when you're done. I pair them mostly with a general purpose spray cleaner. Knowing that I'm not using disposable wiping tools has made me want to clean more.
* It's motivating to start with stuff that's just stuff or trash without so many emotions, and move on to the more difficult stuff later. I also find it helpful to read forums like this for a bit to motivate myself to declutter harder categories, and only work on those areas for a little while before taking a break.
* Cleaning out the crap ""honors"" your nicer stuff more. I don't literally believe this, but in getting rid of the clutter on my bureau or other flat surfaces allows me to appreciate the nice decor items I have a lot more. When they were buried under papers and medicines and whatever else, I couldn't really appreciate them.
* The people at your local big-box donation center don't really care that much about your stuff. Honestly I was really nervous taking stuff to a drop off center at my local Savers, I guess I thought they would be judging my stuff super harshly or going through things one by one or something? I realize now they're not like an antique store and as long as the stuff is in decent condition and not something they can't sell they'll take just about anything.

Edit: remembered another couple:

* It needs to have a home or it needs to go. I found I had so many things lying around the house and that was because I fundamentally didn't have a ""home"" for them to go back to. Decluttering obvious junk helps with making space, but I also realized if it was just lying around it might be time to consider whether I actually wanted it in the first place. 
* Decluttering is not the time for perfectionist organizing. I took out all my cleaning supplies from my utility cupboard and then I found I left the ones I wanted to keep out on the floor for a few days because I wasn't sure how I wanted to organize it. Of course, this led to more stress because all the stuff was still ""out"" and visible. I forced myself to just put it away in a ""good enough"" place and be done with it. I can always reorganize if I feel like it later.",declutter,1739642666.0

I have a toddler who has lots of toddler things. My husband has a ton of stuff that he wants to get rid of but for some reason won‚Äôt? His solution to paper clutter is to toss everything into a cardboard box and put it in a closet. My MIL is practically a hoarder and seems to want to force us into being hoarders, too. I recently scolded her for giving us more toddler books when I had already told her that we literally do not have the space. She will sneak things into our home. Who the fuck does that?? We have a full garage and a storage unit. And we recently had to clear out another space and bring a bunch of stuff into our over-crowded home. So many of those items my husband would look at it and say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand it but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs important‚Äù and put it in the closet.

Paralyzed while decluttering,"I‚Äôve moved in the past year and noticed that I have too much. Now a single empty nester, I‚Äôve made some good progress.

Started under my sink--yuck but successes. Also expiration dates for items under there.,"I feel like Indiana Jones. Everything is out and sorted.

Friday 15: Jewelry!,"This week, it's time to tackle jewelry! Pull out your jewelry boxes and do a quick sort into:

* Sentimental but you'd never wear it now = goes in a memory box, not your jewelry box.
* Unwearable in a way you can easily fix = set it aside, put a firm deadline in your calendar, and fix it.
* Broken, uncomfortable, triggers allergies, not your style, always skipped because you like a similar piece more = it leaves your jewelry box!
* Works for you and you enjoy wearing it = goes back in the jewelry box, neatly.

If you're tempted to save items for your craft stash, for your kids' dress-up boxes, etc., remember that when those fill up, you'll have to declutter them, too. If the bit of jewelry you're holding is something you already know you like less than what's in the stash or the dress-up box, skip the intermediate step and get rid of it.

Day One of Declutter,"I developed an unfortunate habit out of loneliness and boredom during the pandemic and then my retirement which immediately followed it of visiting thrift stores every single week on 99-cent day.

Literally a mountain of it that didn't fit in my modest closet/drawer space has been sitting in bags on the floor in the spare room for way too long now, while clothes that no longer fit me - such as my former work wardrobe - still occupied that precious space.

Notes from a great first session with a declutter/organization professional today,"This time last night I was so nervous about having a professional come help me with my messy and cluttered house. I was nervous all morning. I completely lost track of time the whole time she was here because I stayed so focused. I stayed nervous/on edge the whole time, though intellectually I could tell we were making progress. It didn't feel good or satisfying until maybe an hour after we had put everything back together and she was gone. I wonder if future visits will feel better ""in the moment.""

She asked where I'd like to start. I don't know what I expected, but I didn't expect her to ask me what we should do first! I said that the three most important rooms to do are the living room, the kitchen, and the dining room, and I thought the kitchen would be too much, and the dining room had been the worst the longest, and the living room was where I spend the most time. So I decided that we would start in my living room. 

After a little over two hours, the living room was done! Really and truly done. I hadn't just shuffled stuff around. Stuff went where it was supposed to go, either in the house or into the garbage or donations. 

For the first time in my life, I took care of everything related to the trip I had just come back from the very next day after getting home. I usually drag my feet and whine about undoing all the luggage, sometimes until I have to start packing for the next trip! I dumped out bags that had been sitting for months. I dealt with mementos, some of which I was OK with throwing away, and others I put in an appropriate box out of  the way. I saw clothes I'd forgotten I had. Before today, I would have sworn that there wasn't any real trash in this room, but I found trash that was hiding underneath other stuff. 

She also helped me figure out what I needed to make the living room work. Once I got all of it out in the open, I realized I needed a book shelf and a container to hold games. So I ordered the container to hold games, bought a book shelf off of Facebook Marketplace, and my kid moved the books into their new home tonight! When the container for games arrives, it'll go where the books had been previously. 

I took out two heavy bags of trash (some of which I didn't realize was trash for the previous...many months, but with her here, I could see that it was trash). I delivered a whole box of stuff that goes to my mom's house. She took a box of donations away to drop off for me. Only a handful of items still remain that I truly don't know where they go, and when she comes back, we might have more insights on those as we address other spaces in the house (I'm thinking dining room). 

I was able to vacuum my living room, wall to wall, for the first time in over a year. It felt so good to hear that dirt getting sucked up. That was the most satisfying feeling in the whole session. 

Again, I still don't feel as happy as I imagined I might, but I feel accomplished and the upset feelings have definitely subsided. I also feel motivated to keep going, because of the success of today's accomplishments. ",declutter,1739252898.0
I have too much stuff and don‚Äôt now where to start with getting rid of things,"So I just have too much stuff!

Feeling Frozen and Overwhelmed,"I took a break from decluttering awhile ago after some intense decluttering last month. I ended up donating LOTS of stuff and  schlepping much stuff into an unused room so I could focus on paring down the other rooms and only bringing back what I need. I'm having trouble with facing this room of stuff now. Every time I go in there I feel paralyzed with indecision and brain fatigue. I usually end up closing the door and pretending it doesn't exist. It feels like a big dead spot of energy within the house.

It's all stuff I kinda want, but not enough to have in my everyday space. A good majority of it will need to go to the thrift store or be discarded. I've been reading a lot about not wanting to inadvertently pass stuff on for other people to declutter. I'm trying to find something concrete enough to mentally hold onto when I go back in next time. I really want to reclaim this space and break the bonds of ""what if I need this?"" How should I tackle this? ",declutter,1739221210.0
Decluttering old childhood games and the single thought that keeps me going,"""Someone else will be happier with this than I am with it right now"".

  
I have a lot of stuff. As a kid I absolutely loved video games and while I still enjoy it in my 30s, I've found that many ""collectibles"" I have are just unused taking up shelf space. So I've started getting rid of it.

As of right now I'm going through old gameboy stuff. Not too long ago I posted on r/Gameboy about what I found in my parents basement, and got a bunch of nice comment about my ""great collection"". Except, I get no joy from it. It's all been in a box for \~15years, and even holding the cherished childhood games in my hand didn't make me in the slightest interested in playing it again. So I've started selling it off.

Now, while selling things off do bring in some extra money, I still sometimes get the feeling that ""should I really get rid of this? After all this time?"". But then, for what? To have it in the same box for another 15 years? No, at that point it came to me.

I'm not having fun with this, but someone else will. Otherwise they wouldn't be paying $70 for a 25 year old gameboy game. And I'm way happier that it's in someone elses hands than mine. Also, given that we put so much emotional value in things, are we ""honoring"" our things by putting them in boxes in attics, basements and wardrobes? Or are we honoring them by going back to the tradition of sharing our toys with others, to whom they are an entirely new, exciting experience?

PTSD from others yelling at me,"This post is probably not what you expect...

I'm working on decluttering. I managed to fill a box of usable quality items to donate. It was extremely difficult because in my head I hear my ex screaming at me for giving anything away (or for doing anything/making any choice/having agency) because I should sell it, or I should want to keep it, or whatever. I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this sort of struggle with decluttering.

I myself am a materially generous person and love to give things away and make others happy. But my last boyfriend was really abusive about it. I'm just wondering if he will stop screaming in my head eventually or what. I kinda hope that once I get rid of literally any item I owned while he was in my life his memory will shut up. Have you ever dealt with this? It has been a couple of years and I am tired of it. I work through it and achieve what I try to do but it is sad and exhausting.

Take your time decluttering,"Decluttering isn‚Äôt just about getting rid of stuff‚Äîit‚Äôs about letting go of attachments, memories, and the energy tied to those things. When we try to rush the process, it can feel overwhelming, and sometimes, we‚Äôre just not emotionally ready to let go.

If you‚Äôre unsure about an item, don‚Äôt force yourself to get rid of it right away. Instead, put it aside for a few months perhaps remove it from your space, put it in a storage unit, and revisit it later. More often than not, you‚Äôll realize you don‚Äôt need it, and you‚Äôll feel lighter without it.

I realized this when I put most of the things cluttering my home in a storage unit in preparation for a move. After 9 months I realized that I held onto a lot of items of obligation or guilt or just emotional ties. The separation helped me significantly, and I was able to clear out a 10x10 storage unit filled with my past. When I I returned the keys and closed the door, I was finally free. Again‚Äîthat took 9 months. 

Decluttering isn‚Äôt just about your physical space‚Äîit‚Äôs about clearing mental and emotional space too. Be kind to yourself and go at your own pace. Let go when you are ready.",declutter,1739165592.0
Do it for the people who will be left to clean up your living space when you‚Äôre gone,"Not to be morbid, but my grandmother recently passed and I now have a whole new fire under my butt to clean out my apartment. Seeing my mom and aunt clean out her apartment and the toll it took on them while they should be grieving was a new motivation for me. 

It placed unnecessary stress on my mom, because her sister and her have different thresholds for ‚Äútrash‚Äù vs ‚Äúsentimental items,‚Äù so my mom wanted to practically do it all herself. Add in the fact that my mom is one of those guilt ridden ‚Äúsomeone could use it!‚Äù types, so she meticulously combed through every belonging to post things on FB marketplace, bring to goodwill, etc. They‚Äôve technically been done with her apartment for weeks now, but my mom‚Äôs garage is now holding multiple things waiting for the right person to take it. That is all a topic for another day.

Anyway, maybe another people pleaser like me needs to hear this. If you have trouble decluttering for yourself, do it for your loved ones who will be left with the mess when you‚Äôre gone.

What I use to do when I lived alone, when I would get myself into a messy home from time to time, I'd gather all the random stuff and put it in a box and go through each item and out them in their place and if it was something I didn't need Ill toss. Now I was thinking of applying this method to my partner. Just collect their stuff and doesn't belong or is cluttering just in general (hats,glasses, towels, clothes, hardware, tools and etc) that do t belong in those spots. Im not throwing away anything but just putting it in a box a few days out the week and letting my partner know that this box is for them and the random clutter. Is that something that could work? I know you all would day to communicate with them, which have and I said I'd take care of the cleaning and they said I was able to help influence them to clean up better once I moved in. Well moving in has finally came. So anyways, would this method work for some of you or are their other ideas? Because how can we have dinner at the table if it's full of stuff? Or are there other methods you guys use?

Just curious how some of you all do it when it comes to one ""pack rat"" and one organized person. My partner isn't a hoarder, just a pack rat.

How to declutter a functional/working space?,"I need help‚Ä¶

Background: I was raised by hoarders, so decluttering is something I wasn‚Äôt taught when I was young. In fact I have guilt association with it. 

I learned the KonMari method about 9 years ago and have most of my life clutter free! 

The only space I have now is my homeschool teacher area. 

Now:

I cannot for the life of me figure out how to make it clutter free! My books are always falling over, things don‚Äôt get put away, papers are always all over the floor! I have baskets and bins and a bookshelf, folders and books and files, and all the art supplies. It seems no matter how I store it, it‚Äôs always exploding out a week later. 

Does anyone have tips for running a work/active space without it getting out of hand? Even describing how you manage your ‚Äòpapers in motion‚Äô  space can help me visualize how to manage. 

Currently I am teaching 5 grades, 2 preschoolers, and an infant. I have teacher material for each student and each subject, papers they turn in for grading, papers and forms to hand out, supplies for experiments and crafts, and bookshelves for school, fun, and research. 

We have a schoolroom off the main house with desks, shelves, etc.

- Teton hiking backpack (used twice)

Help me to get rid of some of my kids stuff - mindset problem,"My head says ""it's not mine, so I have no business in throwing it out"". My child can't tell me if it's ok to get rid of it cause of some minor development issues. However they have two rooms, one bedroom and one playroom and it's a mess. Some stuff needs to leave. 


Let me share an example. The dentist came to their daycare and as a reward for being brave all kids got a toothbrush, toothpaste and a bag. Every kid got the same bag, same design. The bag is this somewhat cheap plastic with strings that cut into your hand or shoulders if it's packet too heavy. Back in my days we used those bags to carry our sports or swim gear, but honestly my kids deserve better than that. Also if we'd use it as a sports bag, I guarantee I have to call other parents every now and then to get the right bag back. It's just not worth the stress. We also don't have use for it at home. It's just laying in a box, collecting dust. 


It's not worth it to keep - but it's not mine. I have this mindset from my mom, but she also has an attic full of kids stuff that she doesn't dare to get rid of cause ""it belongs to my kids"". Us, her kids, don't even remember what belonged to whom. We wouldn't miss any of those toys if she got rid of them. Sure I'd love to have the Legos or some other stuff for my kids, but it's not necessary. 


So please, help me to ease my mind. Tell me that this bag and other stuff can leave my house, even if it belongs to my kids. They wouldn't miss it, they deserve to have better stuff anyways. Please help me to make this voice of ""it's not mine"" to understand that my kids and I still have the right to have a clutter free home. ",declutter,1739084184.0

How to actually declutter my house with kids? When I am too attached,"Hello

Basically I‚Äôm in a worm hole of giving up. My house is chaotic. My garage is full. Every room is full. I spend days sorting things out and I can‚Äôt seem to actually see the stuff it get rid of. My house can be tidy and within a few hours it gets trashed. I have a 4 year old and a 6 month old and stuff is just accumulating. 

I really want to get on top of it, not just for my mental health but also this is not how I want my children to grow up. But I just don‚Äôt know how. 

A few points 
- I am currently undergoing extensive medical testing for chronic nerve pain, muscle fatigue and weak joints, and all over pain resulting from birthing my second. So this is adding to the mess as some days I just don‚Äôt have it in me to actually pick things up I just want to sleep. 

- I grew up in an empty house. It felt unloved. My room was always full of clutter as anything of ‚Äòmine‚Äô had to be in my room or my mum would throw it. We didn‚Äôt grow up with a lot of money so I tended to buy cheaper but more things (if that makes sense). 

- I form attachments to things thinking I might need it as I don‚Äôt want to waste and re buy 

- I would prefer to sell items as financially we aren‚Äôt doing great since my diagnosis but I‚Äôm putting things of organising as I don‚Äôt know where to put them 

So yeah I‚Äôm stuck. My husband works full time and tries to help but his method to tidying is ‚ÄòI need all of my tools. But we don‚Äôt need any of anything else (including toys) let‚Äôs bin everything) 

I‚Äôm just overwhelmed and so sick of it 
I love watching minimalism videos but then when I try to empty surfaces it doesn‚Äôt feel homey. We rent so I can‚Äôt paint, or put up shelves or pictures so it just feels like I‚Äôm filling the gap with stuff.

Some was repacked for donations, which I'm hoping to drop off tomorrow

Some was condensed and repacked to go into MY storage - certain things she wants to keep, and as I have the space, I am ok with that.

Some things were added into MY apartment, things I like, and will use.

And finally, some things were just tossed. My mom, while not a hoarder, or even a packrat, was a saver. She was also very handy; could rewire lamps, she also matted and framed pictures and other things, and made and repaired jewelry. so she had a lot of stuff relating to all that.

Her picture matting and framing stuff I donated last year to the activity department in her retirement community.

some of the other stuff, if new and unopened, is being donated, some I kept, and a lot of it, various nails, screws, fastners, etc., in small ziplocks, just got trashed. there was so much of it, and half of it I had no clue what it was for.

I also went through her sewing stuff. She wants to keep her machine, even though I am pretty sure she will never use it again, but its ok. I went through that, and tossed a LOT of half empty needle packets, am donating 3 of 4 pincushions, etc. 

So slowly, but surely, I am going through and dealing with everything. My goal is to bring a few boxes a week home, deal with them, and then bring more, and repeat.

And in doing all of this, little by little, my apartment doesn't look like an episode of hoarders, and I can actually keep it fairly clean and neat!",declutter,1738937086.0
I got rewarded for donating stuff,"I had a ton of kids clothes that my kids had grown out of. We're always low on money, so I planned to sell the clothes online. But I never got around to doing it. I got sick of those boxes and decided to just give them away for free. That's when I learned that a nice or nephew is in planning. So my sibling came over to look through the clothes and I talked them into taking a lot. They were super grateful and in return they got my daughter some stuff we still needed for her daycare start. 


I still had one box left, so I called my aunt, who usually always knows someone. She told me that sadly all the kids she knows are too big for what I have to offer, but she recommended a charity store. I know the ""charity"" stores around here. They take donations, sell them for ridiculous high prices and pocket the money. So I checked out the stores website and it turns out it's a non-profit and that due to our low income I can apply for a voucher. I went to the main office, provided the paperwork and got my voucher. I can get up to 60 pieces of clothes for free (15 per family member). The voucher is active till June and in July I can apply for my next 60 pieces voucher. 


So I went to the charity store, dropped off my donation and strolled through the aisles. My son needed some shirts in the next size anyways. I found two nice shirts for him and one for my daughter. It felt weird to use my voucher instead of paying, but I told myself ""I donated a big box of clothes, I deserve to take the three pieces of clothes for free in return"". 


If I had tried to sell the kids clothes, I had to put hours of work into it, putting it online and waiting months for someone to ask for it. Next the haggling, shipping and all for a fraction of what's actually worth it. Instead I gave it away for free, saved myself the stress, got my living space back in no time and was rewarded with a voucher that I actually have use for and stuff for my daughter that I wouldn't have been able to afford this month.

Friday 15: Take 5 items from your wardrobe!,"For today's Friday 15, pull out five items that fail one of the first four of the Seven F's of clothing:

* **Fit:** It doesn't fit and won't fit any time soon. 
* **Fixes** needed are more elaborate than you can take on.
* **Feel** is bad (scratchy, itchy, binds, etc.)
* **Flattering** you in color and fit isn't happening.

We're concentrating on only four of the seven F's this time because these are the ones that don't call for thinking about the broader context of your life or how your clothes work together. Take these five garments and put them straight into the donation bag without making excuses for them!

Clothing Declutter: What are the right questions?,"I‚Äôm sorry if this has been discussed before! I‚Äôm curious to hear this community‚Äôs thoughts: What are the absolute BEST questions that I should be asking myself with each item of clothing during a declutter beyond just ‚ÄúDoes this spark joy?‚Äù? I‚Äôm in the process myself and need more motivation from y‚Äôall. I‚Äôm looking for both practical and philosophical questions. I‚Äôve been asking myself the following:
1) Does this spark joy? 
2) Will I wear this again? 
3) Does this fit perfectly? 
4) If I saw this at a store today, would I buy it? 
5) Have I worn this in the last 6 months? 
6) What is it made of and is it good quality? (I‚Äôm on a plastics and synthetic materials purging journey) ",declutter,1738896126.0
"Decluttering clothes: when you finally start seeing the payoff (long personal post, don‚Äôt read if you get bored easily)","Now before I start: I‚Äôm aware that already having less chaos in the wardrobe is a win, not downplaying that, but if the more visible space like floors also needs decluttering it can feel a bit defeating when you realize you have to tackle other monsters, and you might start thinking ‚Äúwell why did I start from there when there‚Äôs worse areas that need more urgent care?‚Äù, I‚Äôll tell you why.


I keep most of my clothes in IKEA skubbs and hemmafixares, it works out for me, I also have a ‚Äújunk‚Äù skubb where I keep things I might need outside like coolbags, my travel pillow, swimming costume etc, said junk skubb for some reason was in my wardrobe when my house clothes skubb was above my bed and was annoying to grab out as it was heavy and the clothes inside were not organized well, this led me to always stick my house clothes anywhere where they fit and where I could grab them to avoid dragging down that behemoth.


After decluttering my clothes I‚Äôve decided to swap out the contents of the junk skubb to a bigger skubb (I‚Äôve bought them all after measuring my space available so it was planned before), at first I was annoyed that would mean less space for my house clothes but I managed to put all my t-shirt in one separate skubb so it makes the house clothes skubb less packed and a bit less daunting, also that meant something great: now all my clothes are in the wardrobe, with only my coats and my pjs in separate areas, and the junk skubb was the one above my bed since I reach for it less, why didn‚Äôt I think of this before?


After this I realized I was done with my clothes decluttering, the only things that need possible sorting are 2 pairs of trousers and 2 jackets but otherwise I was done, I had tackled my shoes and was delighted to see some trainers I really liked still looking good.


So now it all hit, yes I was done with my clothes but the rest of the room looks like a mess, my new Vinted clothes I have to wash are on the floor in bags (I‚Äôm washing them bit by bit), my desk looks like a mountain, and some shelves look like a hazard, and the most annoying thing close to me: my bedside table thing (similar to an IKEA malm but with wheels) has been getting on my nerves for a long time, I had organized it several times but I would never put the stuff back where it belonged, why was that? 


And this is when the payoff started, organizing my wardrobe, including my junk skubb trickled over to the visible mess.


I have 3 drawers on my bedside thing, first 2 had a load of cute pouches, wallets etc and the last one had my technology things like my pc, cables, iPad etc which was bursting, I was ‚Äúinspired‚Äù to put my pouches in there by videos of people having these drawers dedicated to them and I thought ‚Äúoh how cute, that way I will definitely use them often if they‚Äôre in easy reach!‚Äù And I didn‚Äôt.


So here comes the junk skubb with that famous extra space to the rescue: all those pouches and things I barely picked up went in there so I could reach for them only if I really needed them and now I had space again in my bedside drawers! 


I was tempted to just move the stuff from my shelves in there to free up that shelf space and my mind was racing with ideas of what else to dedicate those drawers to when I realized that is my bedside drawer, I need that for things I need near my bed, not other things I‚Äôll barely reach for, why find other ways to clutter it when the answer was there all along?


So I sorted all that mess on top of it, I have a small cloth sorting thing on top where I put all my annoying cables (it‚Äôs closed so they‚Äôre not on show) and moved the original content of it in my drawers, it annoyed me at first because it felt disorganized and like if I was creating new junk drawers but listen, it‚Äôs OK to have junk drawers! 


It‚Äôs normal to have bits and bobs that don‚Äôt need a whole space for them individually.


I managed to move some of the technology drawer stuff to another drawer, now I don‚Äôt have it all piling and barely closing, I can actually use these drawers again instead of them being storage!


So, that‚Äôs that, a small victory but big for me, it pushed me to ignore the mindset of using these spaces for storage rather than functionally to my everyday needs, because as much as I value storage, it gets in the way if I can‚Äôt put other things that belong in that space away. 


I‚Äôm happy I‚Äôve finished for now with my clothes, I‚Äôve donated a lot of bags that I clearly had no patience reselling, it makes me happy to know at least some parts of the room are organized and it motivated me to finally see results.

What do you do with things from childhood?,"I‚Äôm sure this has been asked before- but I have a couple of things that I don‚Äôt know what to do with.

Another worry is that if I get rid of these things, then I‚Äôll have even less memories of my childhood. Yes, I could take a picture of them before donating, but that isn‚Äôt the same as holding/seeing the items.

Which is easier? Having a garage sale or donating?,"My friend sort of talked me into having a garage sale to get rid of the many boxes of items I no longer need.

How To Declutter House (Minimal Furniture),"So, I am helping my mother declutter, but want to do it efficiently and effectively.

We‚Äôve got heaps of papers, probably 130 gallons worth of them, that have just accumulated over the years. They‚Äôre contained in multiple 18 gallon totes and crates but they‚Äôre not organized.

It‚Äôs hard not having somewhere to put things. We do have some empty totes and crates though, so that space is available. There is a lot but we moved from a house with lots of space into a smaller apartment. I hope to create a clearer space and make it easy to find everything.

I‚Äôm drowning in toys‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôm going to start by saying that I grew up in a hoarder house, so I have extreme anxiety surrounding clutter and excess.

I am so incredibly tired of moving sh*t around my house, so just have it dragged out again. I don‚Äôt want to force my kids into minimalism, but this is just insane.

Memories and Meaning,"Hi, my parents both had me in their 40s, and came from polar opposites of the world. My father was Swedish and my mother was Ecuadorian, and they came from well-established families with a lot of history. I inherited mostly pictures, photo albums, porcelain, jewelry etc my question is, am I in denial if I don't want to get rid of it? 

I don't have a museum's worth of clutter, but I am also in a time crunch. I sold my house 2 weeks ago, and have 4 days left to get everything out. I don't know where I'm going to live, I'm actually planning a trip overseas but I don't know if I'm coming back. 
The only storage locker available near my house is a  5x10, I took it. 
I'm overwhelmed with the memories and the emotions attached to the life I had before I moved here 18 years ago, to my parents' lives, and to the families in the countries they're from. 

If I throw it all in boxes and in a storage facility, isn't that just delaying having to inventory it later? Am I being too hard on myself? I can't tell I'm autistic with adhd also, I struggle with emotional regulation, and executive function issues. How do I get organized to get all these things out of my house?

Decluttering because im a packrat?,"so my mom died last year and its almost the anniversary date to her passing.

we cleaned so much of her stuff but then I realized its not just her but also dad and myself that have issues..

My main issue is my bedroom as it always looks like an earthquake happened but then I realize that I have too much stuff and very little space for it.   

My main issue is whenever I buy technology, I keep the box that it came in such as a 2300 dollar camera I bout 3 years ago or the MacBook Pro that I got back in 2020 to the iPad Pro I got last year.  I set the boxes up in my room as a display of sorts to show off... BUT it's also taking up room.  

So would it be safe that I can toss those boxes out as one does not need them?

Finally getting rid of my old uni textbooks.,"Once upon a time, when I was a teenager, I had dreams of becoming a doctor. Long story short, I soon realised that I only liked the *idea* of that dream, and simply couldn't cope with the reality of the study load and part-time work. I wasn't even 2 years into my pre-med degree, and I was burnt out and stressed. I liked the idea of working full-time, with no study - just to be able to lock the door behind me, come home, and rest my brain. So I swallowed my pride and quit.  

Many years and a family later, and I still had all my old textbooks in the cupboard. We had dragged them along with us through 5 house moves and today, when I couldn't find something unrelated that I had put away somewhere, I decided enough was enough.  

Too much crap in this house that I've been clinging onto. Would I ever use these textbooks ever again? Probably only in an apocalypse to add extra bullet-proofing to a wall cavity, maybe. Would my kids be able to use them in the future? Not unless I want to make them struggle through using 20 year old textbooks. Is there a buy-back program? Unlikely for books this old. And even if there was, it would probably cost more to send them off considering how heavy they all are. Why not donate to a library? Again, there are probably tons of books that are much newer and more useful for anyone needing one.  

So I'm taking the chance now, with bin day tomorrow (and the bin isn't full to the top for a change), to finally get rid of them ALL.  

It'll be nice to finally open the cupboard and no longer have to be reminded of my academic failures every single time. And that's worth more to me than any amount of money I'd be able to get back from (somehow miraculously) being able to sell them.

What To Do With Limited Use Items,"I‚Äôm trying hard to declutter my life and clothing is a huge source of clutter for me for a number of reasons.  I‚Äôve downsized a lot over the past few months and my current collection is starting to feel more manageable.

However.

I have a lot of clothes/costumes that I wear once a year at most and have no clue what to do with them.  (For context: I‚Äôm a professional dancer and have lots of themed events throughout the year and the themes often recycle yearly or every few years.)  My problem is if I get rid of them, I‚Äôll have to re-buy the same or similar item/s on a yearly or semi-yearly basis, but if I keep it, it feels like it‚Äôs just taking up space in my (better, but still cramped) closet 99% of the time.

What would you do with things you *actually know* you‚Äôll need but don‚Äôt necessarily have space for?

"Yes, you can get rid of it!","If you want to know ""can I get rid of this specific thing?"", the answer is almost always YES. This is r/declutter. You can get rid of it! The exceptions are legal and financial documents that establish your rights, responsibilities, and resources.

If you're concerned about whether you can *trash* something, the answer is usually YES, but there are exceptions:

* Medicines and sharps should go to drop-off spots designated for them, often at police stations or pharmacies.
* Electronics should go to electronics recycling.
* Paints, cleaners, and other things containing volatile chemicals are often classified as ""household hazardous waste."" Check your local municipality's or region's web site for where HHW goes.
* Big bulky things may require a special pick-up, and some places charge for this. Again, check their site.
* Your locale may have specific rules about what goes in trash, recycling, composting, etc. Follow those rules.

While it's good to limit how much trash you're generating, you could clean out one of the 5-acre hoarder farms we have out here in rural California without having even a tiny fraction of the impact that a big corporation does in a single day. ",declutter,1738592783.0
Question for the sentimental or those dealing with loss,"For those of you who are having trouble decluttering because of emotional attachment to the things because you‚Äôre very sentimental or because they are associated with somebody who has passed, I‚Äôm wondering what you have found that works. 

It‚Äôs a hard process. It‚Äôs not just about getting rid of things (haven‚Äôt worn in a year, don‚Äôt need, etc.). It‚Äôs about them, and not having an object they wore or purchased or gave you or things like that. 

I know it‚Äôs not giving away the person, I know there are memories, I know we can take photos, but I feel like it‚Äôs a double process, partially the practical of not keeping everything and partially the emotional, like one less part of the life you shared.

What has worked for you? One of the few things that‚Äôs worked for me sometimes is, crazy as it sounds, thanking the item for its role in the person‚Äòs life. I know Marie Kondo might say something like that, but to others it sounds bonkers. But it does sometimes help.",declutter,1738564220.0
Made progress this weekend.,"I don‚Äôt know if anyone would remember some of my previous posts, but I‚Äôve been working on cleaning out my bedroom. I had piles of to do stuff all along the walls on the floor, had a pile of 6+ blankets on the floor, and boxes and totes filled of sewing stuff all over.  It‚Äôs a small room, about 10x10, so there was a lot of clutter.

I had been working on my clothes too, one category at a time and have made my way through all my clothes with the exception of work out clothes and pjs.  Working on my pjs now and will finish up with the work out clothes.  

My drawers under the bed are all half empty compared to overstuffed just a few months ago.  My side of the closet looks better and I have more room, not as much as my husband does, but I‚Äôll get there.   My shelves in the closet are much emptier and they have space for the blankets when they are no longer needed on the beds for the colder weather.   I do need to work on the headboard, ours has a couple shelves and my side is overflowing with books that I need to either get rid of or remove others on the bookshelf.  

The piles of crap are all gone!!!  I pulled all my craft stuff out this weekend and sorted, declutter and reorganized.  My bedroom floor is holding nothing except the carpet and the bed and it feels amazing!  

I honestly thought it would take most of the year to get the bedroom cleared, but I guess  I was motivated this weekend. Some of my craft totes are sitting out in another room, but I‚Äôm not allowing any of it back into the bedroom.  Either I will find a proper place for them, or they will get declutterred in the next round or two.

Our bedroom has so much more space and it feels like it‚Äôs twice as large now.

Finally making progress!!,"Without even realizing it, I had spent 5 hours cleaning today!! 

I'm fortunate enough to live in the same house I grew up in, I only left for a few years for college. But more or less, I've lived here my whole life. Needless to say...I've accumulated a few things in nearly 30 years. Add in some depression and executive dysfunction, and one can understand how things *might* become cluttered and disordered. 

In a *very* long process to be able to move across country, I'm working on cleaning and downsizing, we'll, everything. I keep saying ""just do it"" and.. well I can't. I hit a wall, or I find a few things ai can decide to keep or give away, and I get discouraged.

Came Across a Letter from My Late Father That Upset Me,"I've been spending half an hour a day sorting through files, and I'm starting to make some progress. Today, though, I found a letter that my father wrote me 50 years ago that upset me. I was thinking about going to grad school at the time, and needed a form signed by him that he would guarantee the tuition. He had always done this, and had never in my whole life made me feel that he regretted the arrangement, but the tone of this letter was quite different. I didn't remember the letter at all, so it was quite a surprise.

In the end, I didn't apply for grad school. With my BA in English, I found an interesting but low-pay job with a book publisher, and started my career as an editor and publisher. Later I switched to business, and completed an MBA that I paid for myself. Nothing really stalled, and my dad didn't have to finance the second, more expensive degree.

I didn't spend too much time on the letter, and threw it away, so that's a success, but it has left me feeling unsettled and a little sad. ",declutter,1738541903.0

The craft sticker hoard solution,"I managed to downsize a lot of my alleged crafting hoard, much of which has been untouched for years. I got my paper materials down to a single folder, but still struggled to part with some semi-sentimental stickers that were from the 90s when I used to write actual letters to my friends. Hello Kitty etc. Stickers are a hard item to use up, I find. 

I let my toddler have access to the stash whilst I was decluttering other stuff nearby. I put out an A2 piece of paper and a bunch of pencils and just got on with filing.

This kid burned through almost all of my stickers in twenty minutes. Kid was wearing three, I got given about five to wear. Blam. Others turned out to have lost their stick many years ago. A giant collage was created. 

Later my kid said 'I need to go back to the office mummy. I'm very busy and need to do my work'. Normally this child spends any time I try to declutter shouting 'Pick me up Mummy! Stop!'

Tl;Dr - struggling to let go of stickers? Let a 2 year old ruthlessly help. They will enjoy it and you will probably feel relieved.",declutter,1738533543.0
"Books: Donate to local library, or sell to Book Off?","Question above. I have a LOT of books to declutter (especially manga), and I'm debating if I just want to take them all to Book Off or just take them to my local library. The thing is, Book Off is nearly an hour drive and I'd have to make multiple trips, versus a local library right down the street. My main reservation is the loss of money (although I'm aware that once it's bought, the money and value is gone), where even if Book Off doesn't pay much it's still SOMETHING. Taking things to my library would be significantly faster and I can get back on track with my depression room declutter, though I'll admit I'm caught in between..

I've had a successful Sunday,"Decided to have a 'get stuff done' day today because I've concentrated on my recent visitors and not done too much around the house over the last week. I made my To Do List last night. 

First on the list was my very own 'clutter corner'. It's out of sight and it's become the little spot that I can quickly shove stuff out of the way. Except it's now piled up with stuff that should really have been sorted. Sorting complete, random items thrown away, other bits put away and a couple of items listed on Vinted. 

Logging into Vinted led me to review the things I've already got listed (this sub has so many discussions about list vs. donate) and I decided to remove all the old stuff and stick it straight into a donate bag. The new stuff will be given a couple of weeks at most then I'll accept my sunk cost and take them to the charity shop to get them out of the house. I feel better having finally arrived at a balance that I'm comfortable with. Let's see how that goes üòÅ 

Next came clearing the bits that have been abandoned on my cabinets. Pairs of sunglasses that had no home.....because I've got too many crappy random pairs for my cases. Not any more - 5 old pairs in the bag, current glasses sorted and put away. 

I've already made my list for tomorrow which includes a trip to drop off donations, and a little sort through of my scarf rack and handbags. 

My intention is to plan at least one activity each day - whether it's a major one or minor. This has come from time spent with my sister who is finding it really tough to reclaim the space in her house. She still has three boxes of tools in her living room that no-one wants and she's had them since we cleared my dad's home 5 years ago when he passed away. I realised that every suggestion I made to try to help her, equally applied to me even though my space and mental place is nothing like hers. I just don't always feel motivated to do things sometimes (ok, I can't be arsed sometimes...there I said it!), so the one action a day appeals to me as I like to feel I've achieved SOMETHING at the end of the day. 

Anyway, I hope you've all had a good day. I just wanted to share my little lightbulb moment in case it helps anyone who might be feeling that it always has to be a big project to get anywhere. It doesn't - just one little action a day might help you to start. X",declutter,1738523021.0

I did it! Decluttered my entire living room!,"Short backstory:


I have ADHD and have been studying or working from home for five years. 
I also own A LOT of stuff. 

My old trusty IKEA bookshelves finally collapsed and I bought new ones which meant I needed to declutter. 

And I have!

‚Äî-

The shelves arrived this Friday and are now up and filled! 

I unfortunately don‚Äôt have a great before picture (but I‚Äôm sure you can imagine what it looked like.) but I have so partial ones and pictures of the process, here: 

https://imgur.com/gallery/Fxz21hX

‚Äî-

I‚Äôve thrown out three moving boxes of books, donated three big bags of stuff, tried every single pen I own and thrown out the bad ones and so much more. 

I‚Äôve thrown out and consolidated enough things that I can throw out five plastic baskets, two huge plastic tubs, two metal baskets and two carts. 

I also bought some plastic tubs to sort stuff in from a store with a one year return window so I can return them now that I no longer need them. (Yes, yes, I know I probably shouldn‚Äôt have but they have absolutely no signs of wear since they‚Äôve just been temporary storage places.) 

‚Äî

I can now SEE my kitchen table that has served me as a desk for five years. 

I‚Äôve even organized all my instruction manuals in plastic folders in binders instead of in a pile in a kitchen cabinet. 

‚Äî


I‚Äôm not quite done, I still have two empty drawers to fill up and I haven‚Äôt decided what to put in them yet. 

Is my home now perfectly clean and minimalistic? Absolutely not!
I WANT to have my books and quirky decorative items visible. 

A lot of people will probably find my apartment very cluttered and chaotic but it is SO much better than it was! 

I have a small apartment, many hobbies and a lot of things. Minimalism isn‚Äôt really on the table üòÇ

My parents have a massive garage space that I could take everything to and use as the triage area. Its only about 3min drive away so convenient enough. 

By the time I've done all the rooms one by one and thrown away the obvious rubbish as I go, the only stuff left is stuff to throw out or donate.

Recycling books instead of donating,"I am in a bit of a dilemma about how to declutter books. I have already got rid of a lot via charity shop donations.

Most of them with a clean up are in good and definitely readable condition, but I have contamination OCD and am feeling grossed out so can't always face the task or do it for long.

My house is a pit of despair. Overcluttered, untidy, falling apart at the seams. Both a direct reflection of my inner mental state, and also one of the main sources of my overwhelm and dysregulation. 

I want to hire a massive skip and throw everything away but I can't afford one, and even if I could, I'm afraid of getting started - most likely because whenever I've tried to declutter in the past, I have end up getting stuck on the value (monetary/personal/usefulness) of individual items and keeping way more than necessary.

I'm desperate for someone to point me in the right direction. I've paid for outside help before but it has barely made a dent, and I've asked various AI apps for schedules/tips. I struggle with all or nothing thinking and the negative side of perfectionism.

So I've be actively decluttering for a year and a half and have done a lot of progress. I couldn't believe how much i had accumulated. I've decluttered every where i could : basement, kitchen, bedroom and clothes, shoes, books, miscellaneous, etc. I keep telling myself : have I used this / enjoyed this last year ? No ? Out it goes.

But here's my problem. When i was younger and around my teenage years i collected a lot of plushies. I already got rid of at least 50% of them and ended up creating two bags : old ones / sentimental ones and the nice / cute ones. Now i feel completely blocked by those plushies. I'm 26 and it might seem odd to not be able to get rid of childish stuff bur i feel very attached to those plush toys. But i still have too many. I can't store them all and if they are stored i can't really say I'll enjoy them properly.

"Decluttering clothes, nearing the end of the tunnel","I‚Äôve gone through a major clothes declutter this year as I need new clothes that fit me and that I actually like, so far I‚Äôve tackled: jackets/coats, underwear+socks etc, pjs, tops, jumpers, jeans and today was a hard one: skirts and dresses.
It was hard because it was something I‚Äôve been putting off for a while, years ago I loved how skirts looked on me and would fawn over possible outfits I could do, which I had most items for, but did I wear them? Rarely.
I realized this mistake too late and hanged onto these items thinking ‚Äúone day‚Ä¶‚Äù this also went for dresses.
So today I wanted to be sure I wasn‚Äôt cluttering my space with items that didn‚Äôt fit so I tried everything on, I already did a declutter last year(?) so I didn‚Äôt have that much and I did already get rid of some dresses recently that I hated the feel of.
The ones that didn‚Äôt fit immediately had to go, that was easy, but what wasn‚Äôt easy were the skirts that did fit.
For these I had to consider other factors that I‚Äôve been strongly considering while buying clothes recently: does it fit well? Am I truly comfortable wearing this?
And the answer was no, I wasn‚Äôt comfortable at all, the skirts were too short for me to imagine wearing comfortably, and I probably thought the same all these years where I was avoiding wearing them.
Last item, a sentimental dress, it was my first dress (after childhood) and I had a lot of emotions attached to it, I felt so pretty in it, I imagined myself wearing it to some events, I did wear it to a party of a friend who passed away and I remember my dad complimented me in it, I‚Äôm struggling to let go of it but part of me thinks it‚Äôs time since it doesn‚Äôt quite fit well (edit: the top part is too small for me) and it‚Äôs still too short for my comfort, I am considering different options if to keep it (for anyone that can fit in it) or not but as for me I can‚Äôt wear it, it‚Äôs the only item I‚Äôm undecided on as the rest is a sure bye bye.
Next and last items to tackle: shoes and accessories, then I‚Äôm done with my clothes.

"February Challenge: Clothing, Shoes, Accessories!","Our February challenge is clothing, shoes, and accessories! For your normal wardrobe (leaving out specialized gear like snowsuits or bridesmaids dresses for upcoming weddings), every item you keep should fulfill seven F‚Äôs.

**The seven F‚Äôs**

1. Fits now, or will in the near future.
2. Fixes are not needed. (If you intend to make minor repairs, February 28 is your deadline!)
3. Feels good to wear.
4. Flatters in color and cut.
5. Functions for situations that actually happen in your life. 
6. Flexible to combine with other items for multiple outfits.
7. Favorite if you have a large number of similar items. (If you have 17 blue shirts but only wear 3, what are your plans for the other 14?)

If an item fails *any* of the seven F‚Äôs, it is ready to leave your home. This means the top in a gorgeous color that feels scratchy and doesn‚Äôt fit right is *leaving.* The thing you were excited about buying, but in five years, you‚Äôve never found shoes that work with it?

It doesn't take more than 20 minutes to tidy toys in order to get ready for a robot vacuum pass. I feel like despite all of the efforts decluttering and organizing I still can't catch my breath on weekends. I still clean, do laundry, try to catch up on dishes and do very light cooking. I used to cook all meals from scratch (before kids), well, not anymore. I have a feeling that if I had cleaners I would spend more time cooking and connecting with kids but at the same time I don't see a reason why I need to spend $200-350 per clean (US dollars) when it doesn't take much time. I spent $800 on a deep clean as a reward for completing decluttering of all areas but I don't see spending that much money being sustainable. What do you all do to stay on top of a clean house with kids but also don't fall behind on work commitments (my husband and I work full-time corporate jobs) and spending time with family? We don't have parents to watch kids within 4000 miles distance (they live across the ocean) or a babysitter. Kids are almost 6 and almost 2 years old.

TL;DR: Having mom guilt over not spending time with family while I declutter, clean and organize all weekend long and thinking if hiring cleaners is worth it.",declutter,1738365644.0
Leveraging a calendar flip,"A month ago you may have heard lots of folks going on about the New Year and how excited they were for a fresh start. Annnnd most people have abandoned their resolutions already üòÇ

BUT what if we took that concept into each and every new month (or week)?

Tomorrow is February and a fresh start, 4 perfect weeks to try a new habit, work on consistency or restart a goal. Instead of waiting 334 days to start new, do it now!

If it‚Äôs easier, consider each week or day a fresh start, for me monthly works well because I always overestimate what I can do in a day and underestimate what I can accomplish in a month. 

There‚Äôs a quote I really love that goes, ‚ÄúFinish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could. Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day. You shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs from Ralph Waldo Emerson and I found a copy of it in my grandad‚Äôs AA Bible after he died. He was sober 47 years so it helped me reset each and every day and stay sober for over 17,000 of them.

Bulk trash removal tips?,"I've been trying to declutter for a while, but one place I keep running into issues is actually getting stuff out of my house.

I have an extremely steep driveway, and a few years ago I broke my leg and tore up my ankle and had a bunch of surgeries. My level of function varies, but sometimes I can't get my trash bins down to the street on trash days. Perishable kitchen garbage gets priority for obvious reasons, but then there's no room for throwing away other clutter. Stuff I know I want to throw away, but for which I don't have trash can space.

Two potential solutions occur to me -- hiring a trash removal company to bring a truck, or renting a dumpster. The latter appeals more because I'd be able to work more slowly over time, and add more stuff once the obvious trash is out and I can see better, and not actually have to interact with people seeing the layers of junk I'm getting rid of.

Basically, I'm wondering if anyone has experience with either of those, or other advice for me on this issue! This seems like the best place.

Also, related -- with items people might be able to use, is there any way of donating where I just dump a bunch of boxes on the establishment's doorstep and run away without having to talk to anyone or explain myself? üòÖ",declutter,1738347653.0
"Company that accepts donated old photos, is it legit","First of all thanks to this sub, I know I'm not alone, I'm clearing out my deceased parents' memories. They were by no means hoarders, in that their house is uncluttered and spotless, yet in the closets are boxes and boxes of paper memories. News clippings, cards, brochures from Fraternity dances, Red Cross Cards from 1948 to 2015. Expired licenses,  draft cards, letters about Honor Society induction,  programs. It's just a lot!
Not only that,  my mother was a champion runner and scrapbooked EVERY SINGLE 5K RACE SHE RAN FROM AGE 45 TO AGE 77. Every race number and her time and the race flier. There are 16 books.  There are many news articles about her breaking State Age Group records.  I've made one scrapbook from all of those articles. My dad was no slouch either he compeyed in Masters swimming and also coached for 50 years- he saved logs of 
handwritten swim times for his swim teams from every team he ever coached from 1952 to 2012. We donatedo 350 sports trophies and plaques! If I could I'll show you a photo of part of it. 

I came upon this website that accepts donations of old photos and paper memorabilia. I read the most recent locked thread on this,  about throwing out old photos where you don't know who the people are, and see no mention of it.  I guess I have hoarding tendencies cause it's been killing me to toss old stuff.  I understand they retain the rights to the photos. Is this company legit? Should I do it? I've already collected a box of stuff I'm downright giddy that I found somewhere to send it besides the landfill.

Friday 15: Socks and tights!,"This week, we're anticipating the February clothing challenge by tackling your sock drawer! This is your opportunity to practice the Seven F's of clothing decluttering in a low-stakes project. Go through your socks and keep only items that fit all seven F's. (If this leaves you with no socks, keep a few of the least-bad and schedule some shopping.)

1. **Fits now** or will in the future. Those socks you hate because they're tight in the calf? They need to go.
2. **Fixes** are not needed. Tights won't spontaneously unladder.
3. **Feels good** to wear. You are encouraged to be picky. Make your feet happy!
4. **Flatters** in cut and color. If it makes your feet or legs look weird, it can go!
5. **Functions** for situations that actually happen in your life. If you have a vast cache of thin, sheer dress socks that you used to wear to an office, but a life where you only wear jeans with athletic socks, it's time to cut back on the dressy socks. 
6. **Flexible** to combine with other items into multiple outfits. If you are intentionally collecting fancy socks, you can waive this criterion. However, for ordinary sock-wearing, your socks should be colors that go with things in your wardrobe.
7. **Favorites** if you have a large number of similar items. For socks, this is mostly about ditching the pairs that you actively avoid wearing because they just *annoy* you for some reason not covered in the first six F's.

You can pursue various trash-to-treasure projects for unwanted socks, but don't transfer your sock-drawer clutter to cleaning-rag clutter, craft-fabric clutter, or random-household-item clutter. It is probably simpler to donate unwanted socks in good condition and trash (or send to fabric recycling) damaged socks.

Decluttering Old Journals & Papers that are filled with Ideas and Stuff that Inspired Me.,"I have a lot of old journals, index cards, planners and torn sheets of paper on which I‚Äôve scribbled ideas for the future, things I am interested in or just random things that inspired me.

My Biggest Mental Barrier To Decluttering,"I‚Äôm almost embarrassed to admit this, but here goes.

I was watching a decluttering expert on YT recently, and she said: *‚ÄúNo one wants your shit.‚Äù* I felt very liberated by that.

And yet‚Ä¶ I still hesitate to get rid of things because I *think* I can get money for them. In my experience, if something doesn‚Äôt sell in the first week or two, it‚Äôs probably hopeless. (Exception: I once sold a super niche item after *years* of on-again off-again trying but that was a fluke.)

It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm hoarding junk‚ÄîI have no problem tossing dented kitchenware or giving used clothing away. But what about those barely worn Wilson tennis shoes that I paid $99 for? Surely *someone* would pay $25, right? And those pants from H&M with the tags still on?

Unintentional decluttering,"So I didn't set out today to declutter. Our current bathroom has little storage, and the new house will have room under each sink. I bought storage drawers to keep medicines, first aid, shampoo, etc in under the cabinets and they came in today, so I was putting them together, and labeling them for the move.

Then went through our current cabinet where we keep all that kinds of stuff to sort it out and put it in the correct bins.

Right before the pandemic, I had done a declutter and stocked up on medicines, and apparently we have been very healthy for the last 5 years, because I had almost a 1/3 of a trash can full of expired medications!  Now I have empty bins. :)

I will stock up on a few common medications I like to keep around, but I was totally surprised at how much medication we had that was over 2 years old!

Thrift took everything in my huge IKEA bag!!,"Hey guys! Yesterday I brought an extremely heavy blue ikea bag full to the brim of special occasion clothes and shoes that I knew I wouldn't wear again but was holding on to... wait for it... just in case (shudder). Many of the clothes were gifted to me but did not flatter me, plus I had already done the mandatory wear-to-an-event-and-make-sure-to-get-a-picture-in-it ordeal. The shoes were beautiful platforms but man did they HURT! I found myself not even wanting to try them on for the last time before making the decision to keep or not, so obviously that was a sign that it was time for them to go.

When I say the bag was heavy I mean HEAVY. 20-25 pounds for sure. Would have probably dislocated my shoulder carrying it in if I wasn't a gymrat and didn't know how to properly support carried weight lol. The thrift took about 2.5 hours to make their buying estimate (this is  important), plus there were more buyback hauls before me in line, so by the time I got the call to come review their offer, I had forgotten most of what was in that bag. Or, rather, I had already mentally parted with the items.  

So here's the biggest success of this story: I did not look through the pile of what they decided to take (everything, yay!) unlike every other time I had sold to them. In the 2.5 hours it took them to review my things, I accepted the fact that they were no longer going to be mine. I did not pick anything out that I thought I was being offered too little for to try to continue selling online on my own. I did not set any expectations on the amount I would get back from them and walked away happy as a clam with -25lbs of clothing and shoes and +$52 cash and some change!",declutter,1738257665.0
Bathroom decluttering help! - a mantra or rules to follow??,"I have a big cabinet in the bathroom full of medications/beauty products/the usual, and for some reason, I‚Äôm having the hardest time decluttering it. It‚Äôs really helpful to me to have ‚Äúrules‚Äù to follow to take out the decision making/attachment. 

Expired medications - toss, right? Can they just go straight in the trash?

Makeup - does it really expire? Should I just toss it all? Most are barely used. Can lipstick be kept if I sanitize it? Eyeshadow? Pressed powder? I don‚Äôt wear makeup daily (SAHM) but like to have options for special events. 

Skin care - toss it all if it‚Äôs outside the ‚Äúopen jar‚Äù recommendation? Or give it a try? A lot of these are things I wanted to try (got as gifts) but had too many at once. It‚Äôs hard to get rid of because they‚Äôre nice/expensive products that I really wanted to try! But many are at least 3 years old :(

Travel sized things - I travel maybe once a year. But when I do, I need it. Have they all just gone bad? Do you all just buy new travel sizes each time you travel?

Hair care - do these things expire? Hair sprays, volumizers, mousses, etc?

Clearly expirations help me ü§£ or I do I just toss them if I haven‚Äôt used them lately (but what if I need them later?! You know how it is).

Cleaned out my cupboards and can‚Äôt believe the stuff I found!,"We have 3 upper cabinets in our kitchen that we use for opened food, snacks, cereal, etc. it‚Äôs usually packed solid. 9 times out of 10 items are thrown in and the door slammed shut.

I ended up with a garbage bag full of trash, mainly opened snacks that went stale or no one really likes but don‚Äôt bother to trash it.  I found 3 opened and at least half gone big bottles of honey, a ten pound bag of sugar, which I knew I just bought, but found two 5 pound bags I had no clue we had.

For such a small space in my kitchen, it sure had a lot of stuff shoved in there and I‚Äôm glad I went through it.  It‚Äôs still crowed as hell in there, but I see more space and hopefully can save some money on snacks while I eat up my raisins!

My boyfriend and I are getting in fights about decluttering my stuff?,"My boyfriend (23) and I (22) have been together for 6 years, not living together, no plans to live together in the next year as we want to save up first. I have a history of keeping things people have given me because I feel bad getting rid of them, and bf has given me several gifts throughout the years. A lot of them are fandom related items, for shows and hobbies I‚Äôm just not into anymore. I also have a lot of stress built up from just overall having way too much stuff. 

Now bf and I almost never get into fights, more or less serious talks or light bickering. One day, I was getting rid of a bunch of clothing and bringing it to a local consignment shop, and I asked him for a ride. He of course said yes as he loves this shop, and off we went. As I opened the trunk to get the boxes of clothes and shoes I was bringing, he asked to look through them. Not seeing the harm I said sure, I assumed he was looking for something his sister might like, and her and I have given each other clothes before. He pulls out a pair of anime themed shoes out of the box and says ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not getting rid of these.‚Äù And confused, I asked him why? He got me those shoes one year for Christmas, and I hadn‚Äôt worn them in over a year since they just weren‚Äôt my style anymore. He very sternly told me that he spent a lot of money on them, and that he didn‚Äôt care that I didn‚Äôt wear them but that he still wanted me to keep them anyways. This went back and forth for about 10 minutes, nearly developing into a screaming match. It ended with him saying that if I‚Äôm not going to keep them, he will until I ‚Äúultimately want them again.‚Äù 

6 months later, I‚Äôm still stuck with these damn shoes, and now I‚Äôm worried about giving away more things he‚Äôs given me, in fear of starting an argument. It almost feels like he is hoarding my stuff, and it‚Äôs very much stopping me from moving forward. Now to be clear I don‚Äôt want to get rid of everything he has gotten me, there are gifts I‚Äôve gotten from him that I still adore. However I‚Äôve outgrown many of said things, as we were in our late teens when we started dating, and now we are both adults. Do you guys have any thoughts on this? I would love some insight.

Inspirational quote I saw,"I saw this this weekend and thought wow that's inspirational. Need to share.

""When you are decluttering, and can't let go of an item, ask yourself.

Am I holding onto this for the life I thought I'd have, or the life I am creating.""

Makes it easier to let go if we are saving it because we thought we'd be thinner, or we thought we'd be a seamstress, or we thought we'd be a musician.  But if we realize, we are happy the weight we are or we'll buy nice clothes if we do lose weight, or we frankly hated sewing, or would rather watch a concert than be in one, then we no longer need that item for the life we are creating.

Holding onto mistakes,"Recently I thought about all the posts and comments with some variation of ‚Äúwhat if I need it, I could use it, but I spent money on it‚Äù and had a personal realization. 

If I bought a bag of spinach because I wanted it for a recipe and then it went bad in the fridge, I would not hold onto it forever because I ‚Äúcould have‚Äù used it or meant to or spent money on it. 

I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs $3 wasted and toss it, or add to my compost bin to recycle it. I don‚Äôt worry about giving bad spinach to someone else or feel tons of guilt about what could have been (a chickpea, sweet potato and spinach curry I was too tired to make).

That feels easy. So why would I hold onto the make up item I hated and don‚Äôt use or the piece of clothing that didn‚Äôt fit right or the terrible notebook?

This came up because about 2 years ago I bought a $4 dresser at an online auction and its condition was a lot worse than expected. It‚Äôs been in my garage so I could strip off the veneer and‚Ä¶ do something with it. But I‚Äôve come around to accepting that I don‚Äôt want to invest time in this $4 junky dresser. I could just toss it. 

So I‚Äôm offering that thought for anyone who struggles to let go. If you wouldn‚Äôt hang onto bad food just because you paid money for it, why are you holding onto ______ when it‚Äôs not serving your needs?


ETA: it‚Äôs not about the *physical* condition of the spinach y‚Äôall. It‚Äôs the process of acknowledging that I had good intentions, spent the money and the time for using that thing has passed. It may be easier to see in wilty, slimy lettuce but the process of letting go is very similar. ",declutter,1738164016.0
How do you guys motivate when you want to get a pile of stuff done but you feel either stuck in making decisions or you just don‚Äôt want to do it?,"I feel like self-discipline with decluttering comes more easily to some people than others.

How to approach family who desperately need to (time sensitively) declutter.,"Hey all. First post here, sorry if this isn't the right place. Delete it if I've screwed up, with apologies. I'll jump to it:

Late-60s family member married a lovely lady a couple years back of about the same age.  He has acquired many things over decades with raising children and then primarily raising his grandchildren, so for many years his house has largely been considered ""full of stuff"". No hoarding, Just lots of, y'know, stuff. Livable but almost no extra space.

Cut to the wife's house which is the same, only her clutter is also extremely unorganized. (There was no rush to sell her place after the wedding, so they slept on it until this year.)  I'd call her place not-quite hoarding, the house is still technically livable, but the stuff-level is very stress inducing.

They are in the process of ""merging"" the two houses. I'm stressed even thinking about it. Beyond the fact that it's mathematically impossible to put the stuff from one into the other, never mind the fact that 3 people will live there (her son is on the spectrum). I don't think they understand the gravity of the situation about how much stuff there really is and how unhealthy it's going to be turning the house into a no-space storage facility.

I'm just a nobody freelancer family member so I have no weight to pull and I'm a giant nobody.  I want to help, but I have almost nothing to offer. This situation is going to get extremely messy as they could probably lose at least a couple tons of stuff and they wouldn't notice. There's no way a stager would do anything with the house except look at it and say ""call me when this place is empty."" I have no idea how to approach this situation as I know the wife ""doesn't want anyone going through my stuff"" and ""I'll need to go through it myself before I get rid of anything.""

Key realization: buying new foods to try is a major clutter source,"I created a good organizational system for my pantry, with containers for each family member and then for categories of food.

Well, the containers are doing their job in the sense of ""to control or restrain"" because it helped me realize that I would buy a new ingredient or a cool-looking treat for the first time, and then not really like it, and it would just sit in there, getting buried under other grocery experiments because I'd think ""I might eat/use those,"" when I'm really not going to.

So, I'm doing two things to help keep things uncluttered:

Store original packaging for expensive electronics or just throw out?,"I have been moving from place to place always keeping the original packaging from my iMac and my speakers. The styrofoam and fit allows to safely transport these things. This is why I have been so hesitant in throwing away the original packaging. In my new place now there is little storage space in the appartment due to living under the roof. There is a cellar but this cellar is rather humid and I‚Äôm sure the boxes would break there. 
Am I being delusional for thinking I should keep these boxes? And is there any way I could store them in my cellar? Unfortunately there are no plastic boxes with the size I would need ",declutter,1738060043.0

"New to this sub, new-ish to decluttering, learning a lot.","My partner and I have clutter. We're newly 60, so we've both have had many years to accumulate stuff. 

My partner likes stuff. When we blended our stuff just over a decade ago, I promised to not throw out his stuff. This means that I manage my stuff. Although, two years ago I told him that if he brings stuff home, he has two options: 1) remove something in the house to accommodate the new stuff. Or 2) store it in the shop (his domain).

In the past month-ish, I have been going through my stuff. WOW! I filled up the entire area of the back of my Outback. This was clothes and shoes only. I have worn my Blundstone boots exclusively for years unless I'm going hiking or on the river. I still have shoes on my shoe rack that I need to re-evaluate. I know I have too many coats/jackets/vests. Like the Prana vest I got on clearance, and it looks really cute, but when I sit I can't breathe....lol. (and, just because I'm removing my stuff doesn't give him license to fill up the areas, because they are my areas).

Yesterday I brought a box to the entryway and started to actually look at the stuff in my spaces and put stuff in the box.

This morning I concentrated on one shelf in the pantry. I found open boxes of cereal from 2017 and 2020. I didn't taste them, I just decided to toss them. I realized that the shelf isn't a good spot for food, but a great spot for seldom used appliances. I might ask my neighbor if she wants the open cereal for her squirrels. But, squirrels don't like expired nuts, not sure what they think about expired cereal.

We still have more to purge, but we are getting toward the end.  4 bags to goodwill over the weekend, another 10 items on marketplace.

Thanks for the dumpster advice!,"Someone on here suggested when we got a dumpster to go up a size, even if we thought we didn't need it!  THanks for that advice.  We are hoping to finally move in about a month, but its later than we planned, so we decided to go ahead and get the dumpster in while we are waiting to move and start decluttering. Hubby is on vacation, so it seemed like the perfect time.  

He filled it about 15% full today!  Attic is empty.  Pool furniture that was no good gone!  Got rid of a lot of old mattresses, and tomorrow he starts on the garage.  I am so excited to see things going that we have had for a while, because it doesn't fit in our weekly can and we didn't have a way to the dump.

I started packing the kitchen and it was nice not to have to figure out how to get rid of stuff that we no longer needed and wasn't really good enough to donate.

Once we are done this time next week with the dumpster, our premove declutter will be done!  We will be taking a few things to use until they can be replaced with something nicer, but I'd say all in all, over the last 5 years, we have gotten rid of about 35-40 percent of our stuff and downsizing to a 20% smaller house. 

Of course, you are never finished decluttering as long as you buy new stuff, but I do feel like we are as close to being done as a person can get.

And if you are in doubt, and have the money, get the dumpster. It's amazing how easy it is to let go of stuff when you only have a week to fill it up! And go up a size from what you think you'll need because its amazing the stuff that you find once you start tossing big items.

"I finally donated all the stuff in my ""But I can sell this for good money"" pile!","One of the things I've been hung up on is holding onto things I know I don't want or need anymore, but that I hung onto because I thought I'd get around to selling them on Poshmark, eBay, locally on FB marketplace, or wherever. It's mostly brand-name clothes (not super high-end designer, but brands that have a good reputation for quality and get decent prices on re-sale markets) or ones still with the tags on, and a few tools that were project-specific, like a post-hold digger. 

But you know what? They've been sitting around for over a year (or two, in the case of the post-hold digger), and if I haven't sold them by now, I'm not going to. So - they're all donated! Gone from house. I didn't even play the ""I'll give myself until X date, and if it's still here, then I'll donate"" mental game with myself. I've had plenty of time to sell them, and I didn't, and I don't know why today was the day, but I was just DONE with knowing that stuff was still in my house.

How I sorted the last 50 years of sentimental papers in a month,"I've been carrying around 50 years of mine and other peoples sentimental papers and they were getting out of control and I needed to do something.

I had around 6 copy paper boxes full of papers of various types and in no real order though some boxes were filled decades ago.

My goal was to go through everything and try to get everything to fit within 2 copy paper boxes volume and either get rid of everything else or put the ""keep but less important things"" in a separate box that could be thrown away / sorted more deeply in the future.

It took me about a month and here's what I did:

I went around the house / attic and pulled out anything that could have sentimental papers / unsorted photos / kids artwork / anything that was shoved in a box ""for later"". I also had a bunch if stuff I inherited from other people.

I got a bunch of empty boxes and put them in my office. Each box represented a specific ""ERA"" of my life

Baby/elementary school

High School

College

First job / First 5-10 years of adulthood

Everything since then til now

Letters

I also pulled out these things to be kept separate

Cards (different than letters since I expect to decimate this box really deeply)

Photos to be processed in a similar way and to be scanned

Really important photos - to be hand scanned and put someplace safe

Kids Art

I then processed each box and placed the contents in the above boxes, filed it in the file cabinet, pulled aside for someone else or threw it away,

I left everything in boxes for a couple weeks as I went through the house a couple times, finding a couple more boxes or folders here and there.

I then went to the store and found plastic boxes that fit my stuff perfectly (each era gets a box 14x14x3) which also helped give me a feeling for how much to keep/throw away.

I still have to process my piles of photos in a similar way to send them off to scanning, but I was able to shrink my sentimental papers down significantly, get them in a semblance of order, and reduce the clutter around my house significantly!

Lots of recycling has gone out the door, plus the old boxes they were in are gone was well making a lot of space in the attic and closets.

It was definitely a bittersweet experience going through everything so be prepared for that but it felt so good to get done and get it all in order. I could imagine doing a second cycle through at some point to further reduce stuff but feel even if I don't I'm not leaving a pile of crap to my kids.",declutter,1737992606.0

What creative solutions have you come up with that helped you get rid of clutter?,"I had to clear out a whole 3bedroom house in a weekend as it sold. I posted on Facebook pictures of EVERYTHING in there that I would have sold anyways - bedroom sets, dining tables etc etc.  

I asked for someone with a truck and helpers to come and take it for free. Caveats - they had to take it on a certain day and do it without my help. 

I had dozens (maybe hundreds?) of takers. I chose a guy whose response was very specific ‚ÄòI have a truck and 3 family members, we will come on Thursday. Here is my cell‚Äô. (Not just that stupid ‚Äòis this available?‚Äô Message). 

They came and took everything - coming multiple times. They removed everything they wanted as well as everything they didn‚Äôt want. 

It was a family that had just come to Canada and had nothing. They were SO THRILLED I was giving them this stuff (the look on their faces was so worth it!). 

I lived several hours from this house and my alternatives were to rent a dumpster or try to sell everything cheap on Facebook. The dumpster would have cost me money and selling everything would have been slow and painful. This solution was a win win (even though of course I had the voice in my head the whole time telling me I could have sold this stuff for money).

Decluttering clothes while pregnant,"Help! I‚Äôve made so much progress in my decluttering journey in the last 2-3 years, but the one thing I keep neglecting is my clothing situation. 

I‚Äôve always struggled with my weight. 4 years ago I was in the best shape of my adult life. 3 years ago I got pregnant and in the last year and a half I‚Äôve been heavier than I‚Äôve ever been. I‚Äôm one of those unlucky folks who can‚Äôt lose any weight while nursing. Now I‚Äôm pregnant again, so of course it will be even longer before I fit back into old clothes. 

The trouble is, I have no idea how to assess what old clothes will fit, and therefore no idea what to get rid of or keep. I‚Äôve got clothes ranging from small to x-large.

I don‚Äôt love the idea of saving things ‚Äújust in case‚Äù they fit again, or as motivation to fit into them. I‚Äôm trying to have a healthier relationship with my body than to pressure myself to be back to the jeans and crop tops I confidently wore in my mid 20s. 

However, it‚Äôs unrealistic of me to get rid of anything that doesn‚Äôt fit right now. I‚Äôm 21 weeks pregnant so all that would leave me is my maternity clothes and xl lounge clothes.

Mental clutter and money,"Okay, here's a bit of an odd one. If this isn‚Äôt the right group, feel free to point me elsewhere, but I do think this ties into decluttering‚Äîspecifically, mental clutter.

I‚Äôve always been pretty good at decluttering physical stuff. In fact, I currently live out of a suitcase, which forces me to think about ""clutter"" in a broader sense. It‚Äôs not just about physical belongings; it‚Äôs about the mental space things take up too.

So, here‚Äôs my question: how do I let go of the *need* to chase small amounts of money or handle petty tasks that aren‚Äôt worth the mental load?

For example, XfinityMobile overcharged me for a service I canceled. I spent time contacting them, got a partial credit, but it‚Äôs not the full amount. Now I‚Äôd have to call again to get the rest. The refund I‚Äôd be chasing is about $25, I earn more than that an hour but well, ""free money."" Logically, I know it‚Äôs not worth my time‚Äîbut it‚Äôs still on my to-do list and occupying my headspace.

What‚Äôs odd is I don‚Äôt sweat losing money in other scenarios. If a meal I ordered doesn‚Äôt taste good, I let it go without a second thought. But when it‚Äôs something like this‚Äîa phone carrier overcharge‚ÄîI can‚Äôt seem to let it go.

I‚Äôve made progress with mental decluttering in other areas (e.g., no longer obsessively cross-checking expenses with receipts thanks to budgeting apps), but this particular habit sticks. It feels like this is more about the principle than the money, and I‚Äôd love advice on how to shift my mindset.

Husband argued with me about some of it but I said, no, it had to go because having it in the house was depressing and it wasn't just cluttering up the house, it was cluttering my mind and think about what the negativity was doing to me. He stopped arguing. 

Lots more to do but slowly, slowly . . .

I have also discovered, as suggested by another poster, that not involving my husband in my decluttering sessions is the *only* way to go. No arguments, no alluding to our friends Maybe and Justin, it just gets launched into the bin. He can't miss it as he doesn't know it's gone üòÅ And if he does miss it then I'll deny everything üòÅ",declutter,1737811307.0
What do you do with  plaques?,I‚Äôm on my decluttering journey and I‚Äôm currently working on my office at the moment. I found a plaque with my name on it from a former place of employment. I really don‚Äôt want it anymore. Any ideas on how it could be repurposed? ,declutter,1737803830.0
Old photos are disposable,"As I pondered what to do with a stack of photos of other people‚Äôs children, it dawned on me that these photos are no different than when we send photos by text now. They were intended to show how the children were growing, NOT to keep forever. The parents already have the originals, and probably saved some for their kids to have after they were grown.

We don‚Äôt save everyone else‚Äôs texted photos, so why should we save baby pictures of our friends‚Äô kids from 30 years ago?",declutter,1737773668.0
"Small, tiny 5 minute win!","I know I‚Äôm early for the clothes category challenge, but I‚Äôve had this nice large PC tower box in my living room that I‚Äôve been putting stuff for my yard sale in, but it wasn‚Äôt quite full, and I was wanting to just get it taped up and out of the house, because it‚Äôs big and taking up space, but I also couldn‚Äôt put anything heavy in it, due to size and bulk, so I did a quick flip through my closet because clothes are kind of light, right? 

Found 3 identical almost new tank tops that I‚Äôve held onto for awhile now because they weren‚Äôt cheap, despite the fact that they fit too loose and show my bra, lmao, as well as the straight fact that I just don‚Äôt wear tanks anymore like I used to. Easy decision to chuck into the box. 

Then I found a Harry Potter hoodie that I‚Äôve also had for a long time, because I loved the Hedwig art on it, but it‚Äôs always one of the last I pick to wear, and I already have a crazy amount of hoodies anyway, and like for real does one girl actually need 20 hoodies?! Ok, I don‚Äôt think I have that many, but I have a lot, lol. So into the box it went.

Final things were 3 graphic tees. I still am rather fond of them as far as the graphics on em, but I just got a bunch of new tees for Christmas, and again, how many dang shirts does one need? I can only wear one at a time after all üòÖ Plus, they weren‚Äôt ones I had regularly been reaching for while getting dressed, so they were just chilling in the closet for the most part.

Friday 15: Medicine cabinet!,"Open your medicine cabinet! It's time to remove expired and no-longer-relevant items. Let's talk about what you're going to keep (from common categories -- you may be storing some of these elsewhere):

* **Medications** that are unexpired and appropriate for conditions you experience. [Here is a guide for safe disposal](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/special-features/dont-be-tempted-use-expired-medicines).
* **Skincare and haircare items** that are unexpired and that you actually use and like. 
* **Make-up** that is unexpired and that you actually use. 
* **Gadgets and things** (toothbrush, razor, hair clips, hair brush, nail clippers, etc.) that are clean, in good repair, and actually used.

Whenever expiration dates come up, there will be people who insist they don't matter at all. If you need to take this position, do the research to determine if the items you're keeping are actually safe when expired. Also remember: if it's expired, either you don't like it that much, or you stockpiled too many.

If you find that items for elaborate skincare, haircare, or make-up routines expire unused over and over, it may be time to simplify your expectations for yourself.

700 items in 7 days challenge,"On 31 Dec I posted about how I wanted to finish out 2024 strong by finishing my 2024-item declutter chart. It was a fun challenge to get rid of 400 random items with time pressure, and I even finished. Second old chart with 1000 items left. This included house items,digital photos and emails, and paper recycling (Post here https://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/1hqawqm/400_items_to_go_today/) 

Since the great start to the new year, it's been a busy few weeks (plus a round of the flu) and the clutter has crept back in. Old post on the bookshelf. Dried up playdough hiding in a corner. To-donate sneakers that are lingering in a box instead of going in a donate bag. And sleeping bags and hiking shoes that need stored away.

With 7 days left to go in January, I'm picking up a new challenge: decluttering 700 things before February. If anyone else wants to jump in, welcome!


Update: 

Welp, we all got the flu consecutively and inhad a work deadline so am barely at 100 items (a mix of physical items and virtual photos + emails). That still leaves 600 items to clear out in 4 days. 

Ideas: Backup and then delete more of the ridiculous amount of digital photos on my phone (more than 25G). Do a closet purge for me and the kids. Clean out the craft and games cupboard. 

It's annoying that I've gotten rid of so much over the last years, and yet there's still so much clogging up the house. (Which admittedly, has limited storage.) Do I honestly have too many hoodies (cold climate) or do I just need a better organization system? Do we have too many art supplies, or do they need a better (toddler-proof) box?

Also I make a lot of excuses for how it would be a shame to declutter perfectly good things. Sigh. More progress later.

Update #2: Things are moving along better! Deleted 175+ photos (my poor phone is much happier). Tackled the spice drawer earlier, so now on to the higher kitchen cupboards and laundry room. In the bedrooms pulled out a pile of outgrown clothes and brand-new diapers to donate. I remember finding a bag of new diapers at a thrift store when I was a young mom on a budget... I hope these make someone happy! I also have a box of cloth diapers that I may pull down tomorrow and add to the growing pile of donation bags. Total number as of today: 455. Two days left to get it up to 700.

Update #3: Picking up speed! Got up to 650 so far. That included cleaning out kids' clothes, a craft box, and a folder of old papers from 2021 (why?). I also accepted the hard truth that, as much as I want to tailor thrifted clothes into cool new outfits, it's just not a priority these days. So into the donation bags with an armful of ""this will make someone else happy"" clothes from my sewing collection.

I also sorted out our winter wear box, because we don't actually need 5-7 pairs of gloves and 3+ hats per person. One of the organizations our church supports is in Albania, and so monthly someone drives a truck of donations over there. It snows here maybe twice a year, briefly, and their weather can get significantly colder. I'm hoping some little Albanian boy gets really excited at the dinosaur sweater, striped hat, and snow gloves my kids have grown out of!

Update #4: 700 and more! This included a bag of play dishes that always get scattered around, a bunch of outgrown goodies, and worn out socks (recycled not donated :P) Phone screenshots from 2023, window clings that were beautiful but annoying. The drinking tube attachment, that I never use,  to my running backpack, which I enjoy using. There is no law that says we have to keep all parts of an item üòÖ

I also went through my clothes while on the decluttering high and was able to say goodbye to several pieces I was keeping because I loved the idea of them. Green cargo pants (too-thin fabric), plaid shorts (fashionable but didn't fit well), a messenger hat (trendy but looked like a mushroom when worn). Gloves that were supposed to be screen-touch-sensitive but that were mostly annoying. Colorful sweaters that were warm and pretty, but always got pushed to the back of the closet, because I have others I like more. 

One of my favorite things about these purge challenges is it changes the way I look at my home. Instead of seeing items defensively (""Oh no, I'm sure I'll need it!) the outlook changes to seeing things offensively (""Oh yes, what else can I find that I don't need!"") 

It's also extremely satisfying to see the garbage bags full of donations and recycling build up in the hall. One wild decluttering day at a time.",declutter,1737712535.0

Professional Declutter Anxiety,"Tomorrow I am having a professional team help deep clean my house and help with clutter. They have turned homes a million times worse than mine nice.

I made a some headway on it today and cleaned before the cleaning tomorrow. But I'm so anxious about it, basically a vibrating bundle of nerves. Most of it is probably due to shame.

"Clothes declutter, 8 bags done","After yesterday‚Äôs initial declutter I have tackled my jeans/trousers and long sleeve tops/jumpers, 8 bags in total to donate counting my ones from yesterday as well.
It was a bit daunting, and I wasn‚Äôt feeling well as I have a bad cold today, but the more I was trying on the more ruthless I was, the more I was getting annoyed at trying on clothes that badly fit the more I wanted to get rid of them.
Now I can finally put all my clothes in their spaces.
I still need to declutter further, and I will continue tomorrow, I wanted to continue today but I don‚Äôt want to push myself too far considering I‚Äôm not feeling well and this was a good 1 and a half hour at least of trying clothes on.
Seeing all these bags was really a wake up call, all these bags of clothes that didn‚Äôt fit me were occupying space that I needed for clothes that do fit me.. I really need to stay on top of what I have.
I am buying new clothes recently on Vinted and that‚Äôs what pushed me to do a serious declutter, I was wondering what was keeping my clothes from fitting in their designated spaces, Why do I seem to have so many clothes yet only wear the same ones that I keep out of my wardrobe? 
I am trying to be mindful and only keeping clothes that fit me and make me happy, i don‚Äôt want to fall into a pattern of overbuying as usual so I‚Äôm trying to limit the categories of things in getting, i don‚Äôt need 10 pairs of jeans when i hate wearing them in the first place.
It is jarring to see all of these bags but this is not stuff i have acquired overnight, and keeping all these ill fitting clothes was only making me feel worse, this is a lesson to me to not buy things ‚Äújust in case‚Äù if i already have others I‚Äôm using in the meantime.

Struggling with the difference between clutter and cozy,"Hi! Local Child of a hoarder here (fantastic sub reddit btw).

A rant -- feeling limited due to a new minor injury,"I'm typing with one hand since my other which is injured needs to rest. I've been in a cranky mood today and I hope it's okay to vent it out.

I was so happy for xmas when my friends listened and gave me consumables. However they did not repeat that for my bday, ugh... they gave the usual thoughtful Amazon gifts, most of which I didn't want, with gift receipts. So this meant I had to make time after work to try to return these items.

This was the first time I got a gift receipt for an unopened item that Amazon just automatically marked as one item that could not be returned. I was so annoyed at that since why allow a gift receipt for something that can't be returned and get my hopes up temporarily that at least I could send it back until I pulled it up from the order number? I was able to at least select to return 2 of the other items. Their order numbers were half cut off the gift receipt so I had to guess a bit before they pulled up.

I drove to UPS. since it's closest to my home for drop off. After waiting in a long line, it was finally my turn. They had trouble scanning the QR code and said it just wouldn't register. First time I ever had this issue so I asked them what to do and they said to contact Amazon Customer Service. I went home, looked up how to troubleshoot the problem myself since it's impossible to figure out how to contact Amazon through a gift that I did not order myself, then nervously cancelled my return and then resubmitted the return which required giving my reasons for each item again. This generated a new QR code. Drove back to UPS. The line was longer this time. After waiting, same shitty issue.

This time, from my phone, I cancelled my return, reselected the items, gave my return reasons, then selected Staples. It's a longer drive but at least a short line. Thank God the new QR code worked here. It was extra annoying to keep hauling the items while my one hand was injured, too.

All the f\*ing gas, mileage, and time for this BS return probably isn't worth it though. Last time, Amazon didn't even credit my account with a gift card credit for the gift receipt and it was like pulling teeth to get the link to a customer service rep for the gift return. I saved the gift order number paper on my desk in the meantime just in case, so I can't declutter that now.

Back home, I  still have other responsibilities, which include routine cleaning and I'm struggling with using just one hand to get it all done... but it's been two weeks since my minor injury so I've delayed my routine cleaning long enough and things are starting to get gross. This includes trying to troubleshoot a toilet leak issue that is not caused by the flapper -- I already tried changing the flapper since that's the easiest solution, ugh. I also picked up a window re-screen from my local hardware store and had to put that back on the window and found something out of place while I was there resting on top of the window sill that I don't recall leaving there before that I don't know where exactly should go... it's weird since I don't leave things randomly in my home and I live alone, ugh. Cleaning out my Dyson wasn't easy with one hand either, and I'm annoyed more and more on the limits of bagless vacuums.

I'm not old, but now I'm understanding better why those folks that are older or disabled can feel so restricted in getting basic stuff done and why clutter can more easily accumulate for them. And now I get why some of my older relatives complain so much :p",declutter,1737619287.0

Decluttering my clothes and smalls,"Today after months of stalling I‚Äôve tackled my clothes again finally, I have already started with some categories last year but today I did a general sort out as I‚Äôve started buying more clothes that suit me colour and fit wise and that I‚Äôm more comfortable in most important of all (compared to my early 20s crop top mania).
I started with my skirts and dresses, been avoiding them for a long time but my thoughts were ‚Äúif it‚Äôs not my size it‚Äôs going away‚Äù and that helped me get a lot out.
Then my tops, I was dreading this, but dry rot saved me from hard choices, and what wasn‚Äôt affected I looked at and thought ‚Äúwould I feel comfortable wearing this now? Is it too short/small?‚Äù And that helped me be more real with myself, I am making more space for clothing I like after all.
Then I went through the even worse sock pile, for some reason I have heaps of small ankle socks that are all used to some degree, so I picked the newer looking ones and I‚Äôm parting with the obviously faded, discolored or pilled ones.
Sure I might become a caterpillar and need those socks but realistically it‚Äôs so overwhelming to have so many to have to sort out, so I‚Äôm keeping what I have space for and the rest is going.
I also have a lot of tights, I will only keep a couple of pairs and get rid of the ones that look too small, I can always re-buy them if needed and at least I can be sure they‚Äôre my size.

Decluttering is half the battle,"My goal was to have 3 rounds of decluttering in 2025, and I am currently in the process of doing round 2. 

I have gotten rid of quite a bit of stuff. 

But I realized that declutterring is only half of it. The other stuff is being mindful of what you bring into the home. 


So here are some tips. 

1. Use your local library instead of buying new books. You can also get video games at the library. 

2. Repair. Bite the repair cost.  I had 4 winter coats 3 of which had broken zippers. 
I bit the bullet, and I brought them to a tailor. It cost me $210 to get the zippers replaced. I found 2 people on my local ""buy nothing group"" who needed winter coats and I gave 2 of them away. I now have 2 winter coats one for colder days and one for slightly less cold days. 

I also got my luggage repaired. It needed a zipper. It cost me $65. So I didn't have to buy a new one, or keep my old one hanging around, feeling too guilty to throw it out. 

I know that sounds like a lot of money, and it is, but I probably saved that on not buying new books. I also didn't have to buy new luggage, or a new coat. 

If you have Birkenstocks, you can change the straps. You don't have to get new sandles.

3. Buy for your size:

Do not buy sizes you think you will eventually fit into when you lose weight. All that will happen will be that you will lose weight l, and you will want to buy new clothes. OR you will not lose weight, and you will have clothes hanging around. 

If you are that certain you will lose the weight and not have clothes for a particular season, learn some basic sewing skills and tailor your clothes down. Believe you will feel good. Or take a few pieces to your tailor to do it. 

4. Abstain from compulse purchases:

Do you need that necklace for that outfit? Or do you have one that will do the trick? Do you need a new outfit for that wedding? Or will the outfit you wore it to the last wedding do the trick? 

5. Take care of your things: polish that silver, treat that stain before washing, wash your shower curtain and liners, clean and maintain your items, get rid of the tea stains in your mugs, put antivirus on your computers, sharpen your knives and scissors, tune your piano. This way you can use what you have. 

6. Repurpose: you don't need a seperate item for every use. Do you need a mandolin? Or will a knife do the trick? Does your shower liner need to be thrown away? But another cloth one, and use the polyester cloth one as a liner. It will last way longer. Do you need to buy a cup for your toothbrushes or will an old mug do the trick? Do you need to buy a spray bottle from the dollar store, or will your old fantastic spray bottle do the trick? Do you need a new bathmat because yours is worn out? Or will an old towel do the trick? Do you need seperate dog poop bags? Or will an old bread bag, or fruit, or vegetable bag, do the trick? (It's amazing how many we accumulate.) 

7 give consumable gifts: finishing salts, honey, maple syrup, tea, coffee, chocolate, soaps, alcohol, hot chocolate bombs, scratch and wins, soup mix etc. 

Or gift a service: landscapping, maid, personal chef, professional organizer. 

Or an experience: plays, concerts, symphonies, movie theater outings, out to dinner, dinner theater tickets, gun range, laser tag, escape room, hot air balloon ride etc. 

Or classes: cooking classes, gun safety classes, flying lessons, baking classes, language lessons, instrument lessons, dancing lessons etc

You don't want to be part of someone else's clutter problem. 

8. Do you have someone who brings you random gifts or things because they are considerate and thoughtful? 

Tell them while you appreciate the thought and gesture, that you are trying to declutter. Tell them that the next time they want to bring you some gift that maybe they can call and ask you first to see if you want or need it. Unless it's a gift that the 2 of you can enjoy doing together like maybe some wine and cheese. 

Every bag you bring in, is a bag you will have to bring out sometime, either while moving etc. 

9. Start being ""low waste."" I buy cleaner tablets, laundry detergent in powder bulk, I use solid soap bars,(or liquid soap tablets) powder to  gel to dish soap(and I reuse my dispensers)  solid stain remover bars instead of sprays, shampoo, and conditioner bars, dr Bronner's for body wash etc. Buy replacements heads for your razors, or buy a straight razor etc. 

You will have way less clutter under your sink and in your laundry room. You won't have a bunch of empty plastic containers waiting for recycling. 

10. Use what you have. 

Use what you have, instead of going to buy new stuff.

Beginning My Declutter Journey-Thoughts on Hiring a Professional Company?,"I have decided to begin my declutter journey! Its excited but overwhelming. I plan on taking it slowly. I wanted to get some advice on maybe hiring a professional company? I know its expensive...... but do you think its worth it? the rates I am seeing at a local company are $1,200.00 for 6 hours of help.... 

for me this would be a one time cost and then maybe just take over from there by myself... I cannot afford to do this twice.... 

I am someone who tends to get overwhelmed and give up easily creating a vicious cycle. I also grew up in and out of foster care and facilities so at times its hard for me to give up things because I am scared I will regret parting with it. so overtime, obviously things pile up and I don't ever end up using or needing them....

Anyways if anyone has ever paid for help with decluttering I would love to know your experience?

Need help deciding what to do with my CD collection,"**TL;DR: never thought of parting with my CD collection; idea of doing so was triggered when I realized I dislike the look of my CD rack in my new home. Unsure if I should get rid of the whole collection, part of it, just the rack, or none of the above.**


I have a pretty large CD collection. I'm a bit nostalgic about the medium itself tbh. I know it's much easier to listen to digital music nowadays, but I still have my old stereo with CD player, which I do use occasionally (not as often as I used to back in the day, obviously). 
Most of them, I admit, are from an era in my life I've moved on from - obscure subgenres, rare finds I was proud of 20 years ago, ""genre classics"" I just *need* to have in my collection - and I've been keeping them because they're part of my collection, not because I really listen to them now. (I was a total music nerd back then.) There are some treasured favourites, but most aren't. 

I recently moved and still have all the CDs in boxes. In my old apartment I had them in a large wall mounted CD rack which held almost all of them, and a few extras were on a small floating shelf (mostly because they have special packaging too thick for the rack).
Today when an acquaintance was over to help mount some shelves, I expressed that I'm not sure where to mount my CD rack as I can't figure out a space on my wall that would look good. Said acquaintance then confirmed that the rack isn't very stylish, that it would make the wall look cluttered, and proceeded to suggest I keep them in a drawer (and get rid of the rack.) When I told them there were too many CDs to fit in a drawer, they were baffled about how many I have, and proceeded to give some friendly suggestions which I feel won't really work for me either. 

I didn't come to a conclusion so they're still in boxes for now. And now I'm starting to doubt if I should even keep my collection at all. 

Here's my dilemma: 

- I do want to achieve an uncluttered look and lifestyle. I don't have any collections or sentimental items on display, the CD collection was my only exception. 

- I used to like that they were displayed on a wall instead of occupying space elsewhere (though I admit I hated the dust on them, but at least they're easy to wipe). 

- I'm not sure why I no longer like the look of that particular CD rack; it's in perfect condition and holds a large collection so wouldn't it be stupid to get rid of it? Why create a new task for myself, buying another storage for my CDs? 

- Should I get rid of some? If so, which ones? ""I hardly listen to it"" won't work as a criterion since I hardly listen to *any* of them. Might as well get rid of all and just digitalise. 

- Or maybe keep only a few favourites and, actually, put them in a drawer. But where would I draw the line? 

- And will I miss some of them for their decorative aspect (cool cover)? Will I miss the music itself? Will I miss owning ""rarities""? 

I have no idea how to tackle this and am so confused about what I want. I'm really bad at decision making in general (I have ADHD), and at decluttering specifically. Any thoughts about this will be appreciated!! 

Sorry about the wall of text (and I realize it's a total first world problem, lol). Thanks for reading!

Should I throw away my grandmother's china in order to get a new set of enamel tableware?,"I have an opportunity to buy a nice set of enamel tableware second hand.

The price is great, we have a new baby and are planning more children and I'm tempted because it doesn't collect weird smells and flavour like plastic/silicone, it's really compact and lightweight. And aesthetic. It's a nice full set with a lot of plates and we host a lot. 


However, my current set is china from my grandma. It's gorgeous but clunky and the main issue is I dont keep a kosher kitchen, but all my family do, so I can't give them to anyone else. I know that no one else is interested in sentimental old china. Also I still feel sentimental about it, and I love using it daily for that reason. 

Help me to decide this one! ",declutter,1737535564.0
Finally got to hard areas as working mok w 2 little kids.  Seeking a little high five.,"Edit: Mom. 

Big organizing day: fam w 2 little kids. May I share since you get it?

Cross posted. 

I finally got to some tough areas of the house for me today.  

The 2 motivations:
1) seeing a mom friends house that was so relaxing and curated and decluttered. 

2) I had one goal: maximize a pile of  donations from around the house. Worked better than ""I want to do my bath and closet"".

My husband is not the type to appreciate tidying. So I'm here.

26 hours over the last 2-3 days (lesson learnt, smaller bites better for my Gen X back. Ouch.)

----
The big wins:

2 little ones 3 and 7 home that last 3 hours. They agreed to let a box of toys go into the garage to fit their new Xmas presents. 

And after a tour -instead of their usual tears -they agreed to how I organized ! (They got ice cream and art time w me for not complaining.)

The master closet has been my Achilles heel. It's the only place big enough to stash clothes, subdries, bags we didn't get organized before  some visitors (smoke affected extended family from LA fires).

1 garage done. I did half before Xmas and today finally got holiday decor down, boxed and up high.

3 dressers done 

-----
Finally did:
-13 Master bath drawers
-clothes donated, hung or folded
-1 dresser finished
-11 bins of sundries sorted (lotions, hair, tooth care, makeup etc)

Lesson:  wish I pushed harder or paid  to organize after we moved in 2 years ago. We got used to suboptimal locations.

-----

Whole house led to:

10 grocery bags to donate

-a full outdoor trash bin and 1/2 full recycling 

-3 dressers done, 10 toy bins, 12 built in drawers organized. 8 plastic bins of subdries done. 

-and Christmas decor inside finally down and boxed. My kids wanted to keep the tree up!


------

Kids:

Did their 8 kallax bins of toys/books/crafts organized by category. Goal: good enough. Fewer categories. I have 4 left. 

Lesson: KonMari is too much but I kept what worked (smaller bins in bins, donate serviceable things I don't like/don't spark joy.)

-their desk, bookshelf and nightstand drawers organized. 

-finished 1/2 their closet sorting toys, clothes and more seeking donations

----------

What helped:

I usually have a mountain of laundry organizing day. This time I did the many loads beforehand. Then I folded it all. So today it just had to be sorted by person and finally put into dresser drawers organized hung. 

2.5 hours of 2 cleaning people today after a month. And then one stayed 2 more hours to help w my closet. I can't declutter if the house is dirty. 

-accountability:  I just couldn't get to this closet for a whole year without someone present/cleaning near. I keep getting stuck when a bin/bag had mixed categories.

When in the kids' room over last few weeks I did small bits like separating few clothes we wear less. Then finally I was ruthless today. 

-simplify: 

I always before today go too slow. I have  ideas of specific people with younger kids to give things.  I previously thought  ""sell, give my friend, donate to goodwill, list for buy nothing, keep in garage, closet or dresser."" That's ridiculous. Just did donate/keep/toss.

Thanks for reading. I try to organize an area here or there quarterly, but it's the first time I got so many areas to a place of satisfaction.

Advice, tips, thumbs up welcomed.

"Chances are, everything is fine","Hello, r/declutter!

I don't frequent this sub very often, so I apologize if this post has issues in some way. I just wanted to share something, as I have a history of hoarding and am working on that all the time :) 

A few years ago, while I was living on my own, my parents gifted me their old TV. They had also bought a new label maker, and peppered the TV and remote in little hearts and a message for me. It was great, I loved it. Over time, I started to want a newer, bigger TV, but I felt guilt about wanting to get rid of a cute gift from my parents. ""How would they feel if I got rid of it?"" I would ask myself. 

I end up having to move back in with them, and we put the TV in storage. I'm moving back out soon, and we're going through it and my mom goes, ""Who's is this?"" It's my TV. ""Who gave it to you?"" You did!? ""Oh, I totally forgot. Neat. Do you want to keep it?"" I'm getting rid of it and buying the bigger TV for my new place. 

So the point of my story is to let other people who struggle to let go of things because of sentimentality, that the person who gave you the item probably gave it you, for you to do whatever you want with it. If its time has come and it has to go, that's okay!! Nobody is mad at you and you're doing great. :] ",declutter,1737500672.0
Family doesn‚Äôt allow me to get rid of all their junk,"I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I live with my mom, and my uncle moved in with us a few years ago. 

My uncle has never cared about cleanliness‚Äîwe helped him move out of his old place and it looked like one of those hoarding homes. But he doesn‚Äôt hoard, he just is extremely lazy. He doesn‚Äôt clean up after himself, the few times he‚Äôs done the dishes they‚Äôre still dirty and I have to rewash them, he‚Äôll let used tissue paper pile up in his bedroom till you can‚Äôt see the floor, etc. 

My mom has more of the hoarder mentality, but the house doesn‚Äôt look like a full on hoarder home. It just looks cluttered and embarrassing. She gets sick a lot (vertigo and has been smoking cigarettes her whole life), and she‚Äôs very inactive and overweight and gets tired easily. She wants the house to be clean but doesn‚Äôt (can‚Äôt?) put in the effort to organize all her shit, and she gets mad if I try to throw any of it out. 

My mom and uncle have 5 other siblings. 7 total. I understand why my uncle buys shit in bulk and why my mom is afraid to get rid of things in case we need them, but we can‚Äôt even find the things we need amidst all the junk, so it‚Äôs pointless. 

Is there anything I can do? Any way to motivate my mom? I have no hope for my uncle, who seems to genuinely just not care. But I know my mom cares and wishes it was better. She‚Äôs the type to say over and over how she should be doing this and eating better and doing whatever else, but then never actually does it.

My pantry is a little too well stocked - for the next 2 weeks I'm only buying perishables,"I try to keep a certain number of different types of ingredients, like 2 kinds of pasta and 5 kinds of frozen meat. I rarely buy exactly the same ingredient twice in a row. That gives me enough food to cook creatively but not so much that it's unmanageable. 

Well, I just had my yearly shopping run to Trader Joe's and a Mexican grocery store. I finally found a good deal on a few ingredients I've been meaning to try. My neighbor loaded me up on root vegetables. My pantry has gone from stocked to cluttered.

For the next 2 weeks I'm only letting myself buy perishable foods like veggies and dairy. Everything else comes from storage. After that I'll re-assess and maybe change a few habits.

Food I've already made to use up staples:

* A ""clear out the fridge"" salad with frozen parsley and long-lasting veggies like carrot, cabbage and radish.

* Protein bars with nuts, peanut butter, chocolate chips, cinnamon and maple syrup.

* Pickled mustard seeds because I have like a pound of whole mustard seeds. 

Food I plan to cook next:

* Instead of buying yet another spice mix from Trader Joe's, I took pictures and will try to make a few copycat mixes. I have a lot of whole spices.

* Grain bowls, tacos, pasta salads, barley soups, anything with meat and a lot of grains. I have like 6 bags of grains to chip away at.

* Some of the 5 chubs of chorizo to put in said grain bowls and tacos.

"Trust me, you are worth it","I don't know who of you need to hear this, but here we go: you are worth having nice stuff. You don't need to finish using a product that you don't like. You don't have to wear an ugly sweater till it falls apart. Stop telling yourself ""but I paid money"" or ""It's still good enough"". Yes you paid money, but so what? The money is gone and it won't come back by using or just keeping stuff you don't like. You don't need to punish yourself for buying or being gifted something you don't like. Just stop it and throw it away. You are worth it to have things you truly like and enjoy. 


Let me tell you about my latest success. I have bad teeth genetically, so I should take extra care of them. For whatever reason we have a ton of mouthwash and I'm the only one using it. The products we have hurt my mouth and I do not like the taste at all. So I had the result of barely using it (not good for my teeth) and if, it felt like torture (not good for my mental health). I finally had enough. I went to the store, got me a bottle of kids friendly mouthwash (it colors teeth pink that aren't brushed correctly and tastes like yummy 1990s bubblegum :D). Back home I took all bottles of mouthwash and poured them out, except for my new one of course. 


With that little action I now created more space. Got rid of stuff that no one uses anyways. And I now have a mouthwash that I'm looking forward to using every day, which is also good for my teeth. My inner self still screams about the ""wasted money"" sometimes, but was it a waste to throw away stuff I don't really use? No. And it helps so much to just tell myself ""I am worth it to have things I enjoy"". 


Now it's your turn. Get rid of stuff you feel pressured in using or keeping just because ""money was spent on it"". Get yourself something you really like and use instead. YOU ARE WORTH IT! ",declutter,1737454551.0
basement full of dead peoples stuff with no organization. how do i tackle without becoming overwhelmed?,"First, the house came pre- cluttered. Our landlords father in law lived here, his children took what they wanted, and left the rest of his mess here.

((Thanks for the messages.))

((I did say I hate existing, but my psychologist and doctors that I mentioned are well aware that I hate existing.. so don't worry about it.))

If you need some miserable context:

Chronic pain and fatigue are killing me. Doctor's don't help much and I'm so sad I've just been laying in bed all day crying and taking sleeping pills to pretend I don't exist. I got through some stuff at some point.. but sometimes it just gets worse all over again. I hate that I have to eat every day. I hate that I have to exist. I am overwhelmed even when I do nothing. Like many of you, cleaning other places is fine. And even thinking about cleaning my own stuff feels like hell. I also live in a small studio apartment and don't have much room. But I'm trying not to just shove stuff on shelves and in closets and in buckets and piles and drawers in the space I do have. But sometimes I don't know how else to organize small things.

I grew up in a hoarder house, but I also grew up with a narcissistic abuser who would steal my things for herself, throw away anything important to me on purpose, throw away my clothes and makeup so that I have to ""look ugly in front of everyone"" when she was mad at me, ""lose"" all of my belongings (only mine) when we moved, *tell me to put all of my favorite and most important and loved possessions/papers/trinkets/memories in a small box because she was throwing away everything else.. and then throw away that special box right before the trash came*.. essentially I had everything I loved or cared about ripped away from me and also things that made me feel comfortable or good about myself. And now I am scared to lose those things. She also never had as live in a functional household with schedules or regular activities like dishes and laundry and stuff. We snuck around to clean our stuff when she wasn't around, ran to do chores when she yelled at us to, and hid in our rooms from her otherwise. When guests visited she would have us clean our disgusting house for days before they came so we could pretend to be clean.

And it does not help that I have ADHD (bad) and maybe autism according to my psychologist but whatever. I feel like the pills are just messing with me, but also like I hardly function without them and never really did. I don't know. But my executive skills or whatever it's called (organization and timing and chores and stuff) are so bad and I basically can hardly function as a human being.

Then there's the chronic illness, which I won't get into, but I have a genetic condition and then small fiber neuropathy for some reason. And all of it feels so bad that it makes me think some real bad thoughts. 

And since I look relatively normal and dress relatively normal and wear a little makeup and don't smell like a sewer rat, people just think I'm okay. Even if I tell them everything. They just say it's fine. Or ""I'm sure it's not that bad"".

I am sad and stressed and embarrassed and anxious. Scared I can't have a life or my own family or a relationship at all. Scared of my landlord coming in. Scared that I can't be a functional person and it's too late for me.. I can't have people over. Not even my family. My dad glanced in my apartment and then told my brother he thought I was a hoarder and my brother called me all concerned..

I've been telling them I think I have a hoarding problem for years.. I'm glad they finally were able to come to that conclusion though. But me.. who lives here every day.. and exists in my mind.. and see's this place.. can't figure out those clues. Not a good source..

I could keep going. I'm sure some of you get it... right??

So, if you read all that.. 2 sentences. Tell me to destroy this stuff. I can't get rid of everything but tell me to get rid of.. something?! Or what to do or.. maybe I just need a friend. I don't know.

If you need more than 2 sentences, have at it.",declutter,1737413056.0

I'd rather have something like a really large throw to snuggle up in on the couch. Would a quilt or blanket be better for that?

Win!  Kids are more open to decluttering after a shopping trip to the thrift store,"After many trips to drop off donations at various local thrift stores, my kids (6 and 8) asked to see what they're like inside.  I historically haven't brought them to the thrift store because they just looooove getting \*stuff\* just for the sake of it, so I figured it would be a disaster.  But I decided to give it a try, and set expectations ahead of time on what we would bring home.  

Not surprising, they both found something they wanted (I did get them one thing each).  More surprising is when we got home and I was helping them clean their rooms, they were both MUCH more open to getting rid of toys and books they hadn't used in a while.  Normally it's ""but I love that"" or ""I use that all the time"" even if it's something they probably didn't even remember they owned, but after this trip I heard a lot more ""yeah, I can let another kid enjoy that"" or ""I think I'm done with that.""  

I've always told them when decluttering that another kid would be really happy with the toy they no longer care about, so I guess my kids getting a turn at being that theoretical kid must have made it more real to them?  ",declutter,1737381723.0

Making headway and starting to embrace this process....,"I had to move due to health issues. I am unpacking my belongings from a move in 2023.  I have really started to gain momentum and earn the progress of decluttering.  This feels good.  I am looking at it as a maturing process. I want to get rid of the mental clutter in my mind. Peace, calmness, and relief is what I am focusing on and striving for....  Unfortunately, it has been a process to get to this point. I was not prepared emotionally for the vast range of emotions to feel.  I backed off a bit to process my wide range of emotions and start again.

Now, I know why on ""Hoarders"" they don't want to release the excessive amount of belongings.  Starting this process is incredibly hard yet doable.  I am encouraging the lurkers to get at it. Lol.  Anyone can do this. Sure, certain parts of it absolutely do suck.  It is nothing we can't overcome. I am feeling more positive about it, since I worked through a lot of my overwhelm and anxiety about releasing 90% of it.

I think my intentions are also to be kinder to mother earth without overconsumption anymore.  I use to have a horrid shopping addiction to fill some sort of void inside myself. I realize I don't need that anymore to feel whole.

I watched a video about our US trash dumps.  It was disgusting to see how we all contribute to it.

I am disturbed about the amount of brainwashing to buy the commercials are responsible for...every holiday is about decorating.  They already have items out for Valentine's Day and St. Patty's Day, just non-stop consumerism in a capitalistic society.

It is very strange, when I was in my shopping compulsion, I was too into the shopping cycle, or close to it to see the reality of it all.  Wow. What a wake-up call!

The biggest change I have made is not buying something every day,  Now that seems so unnecessary.

There‚Äôs just stuff everywhere ‚Äì closets, counters, and even spaces that should feel cozy have turned into storage zones. It‚Äôs overwhelming, and I don‚Äôt know where to start, but I know I need to.

I want my house to feel like a sanctuary again, a place where my family and I can relax and feel at peace. The thought of decluttering is both exciting and daunting. I‚Äôm ready to let go of things that no longer serve us, but I worry about getting stuck or not knowing what to do with everything.

If you‚Äôve been through this, I‚Äôd love to hear:

1. What are some practical tips for starting small but staying consistent?


2. How do you decide what to keep and what to let go of?


3. Any advice for avoiding burnout or guilt when parting with sentimental items?

Declutter vs reorganize/churn?,"I have 2 small children and have bought very few designated ‚Äútoy storage‚Äù items.

Carry on decluttering or upsize?,"I have lived in my small 430sq ft appartment for two years. When I moved in, I did a LOT of decluttering and took dozens of bags to charity stores. My partner moved in a year ago I did another round of decluttering to make space for his things. He also decluttered a lot of his things. I am now at a place where I only own things that I love & use regularly. The same goes for our shared things such as kitchen/bathroom things. However, our space feels cramped & cluttered. Do I try to do another round of decluttering, try reorgansing the space, or accept that the space is just too small for us?

Way too many clothes but I actually like everything ,"Hi all. I did a fairly decent purge last year of all the stuff that was old, dingy, didn't fit right, or didn't really fit my life style, but I still have way too many clothes. It's to the point that it affects my ability/motivation to keep up on laundry because I don't have room to put everything away. The problem I'm running into now is that I actually like everything I have, so when I try to get rid of stuff I don't know what to get rid of. Sure there's stuff I reach for more often, so those items are a no brainer to keep, but how do you part with the other stuff when I like it and it fits well? Also, I've found that when I get really cut throat about getting rid of stuff, inevitably I end up regretting a a handful of pieces and wishing I still had them later on, which I'm finding is making it more difficult to get rid of stuff now.",declutter,1737326160.0

"""Where can I donate books?"" Psychiatric hospitals!!!!","I've seen a lot of ""what do I do with books"" posts lately, and wanted to share an unexpected answer - your local psych wards. 

Being on the ward was BORING. My longest stay was 3 weeks, and by the end of it I was honestly a little stir crazy. 90% of the time, outside of any groups or whatever, everyone is sitting around in the dayroom. At the adult ward I went to, the entire 5 shelf bookcase was full of stuff published probably no later than 1990. I was born in 1999. I basically begged my mom to bring me a stack of my own to read. 

If you have fiction that you aren't sure what to do with, consider calling up your local psych hospitals and see if they want newer books for their patients. They'll likely be more receptive to paperbacks than hardback (a softer book is a safer book), and they won't be allowed to have certain themes, but I promise you the adults and teenagers that are hospitalized are bored as hell the majority of that stay.

Hitting a wall when it comes to wardrobe. ,"My husband and I are both very similar in our attachment to items. From our upbringings and other issues from our past, we both have WAY too much stuff.

On a different post on this page someone talked about the 2025 challenge of getting rid of two thousand and twenty five items in this calendar year. I‚Äôm not sure if it was becoming new parents or what but my decluttering has actually gone super well, better than it ever has in my life. Physically having something to mark and check off has definitely helped. And I find that the space is getting more clean and straightforward is so motivating to do more.

Struggling to get rid of sentimental items:-(.,"Hello all! I have recently been browsing this community  &  decided I would give asking for advice a go.

I am 19 years old and I have been on a slow,  but steady declutter journey for the past 5 years. I have gotten rid of so many things! Yet there‚Äôs one category of item that no matter how hard I try to tackle, I have a wave of anxiety and sadness at the thought of letting them go: sentimental items! 

A lot of these items are miscellaneous, and I have a hard time finding proper places for them, some are paper, but a very large majority of them are toys from my childhood. I have decluttered 85% of the toys from my childhood, and left ones that hold a lot of meaning to me, however, as time goes on and I look at them in my closet, I feel like Im stuck. It‚Äôs weird, I cant really explain it well, Ive talked to my therapist about it and we both agree this anxiety / uneasy feeling of getting rid of them stems from childhood trauma stuff with my PTSD.   
One tactic I‚Äôve done is put things Im not ready to get rid of quite yet into a box under my bed, it has limited room, and whatever doesn‚Äôt fit gets tossed or I make room by getting rid of something from the box. Even at this, I feel stuck with these items, Ive tried the picture taking method, but it just made me sad to look back on them. With my toys, Im really struggling, I have very limited space in my room because of how small it is, and me entering adulthood, I feel really embarrassed still holding onto them. 

  
I think another set back- and probably why I am the way I am, is my parents are both VERY sentimental people, and when I first started decluttering, I got yelled at for throwing things away they haven‚Äôt thought of or saw in years, yet when they did, suddenly they needed to keep it. They aren‚Äôt hoarders at all, its just sentimental items that they have difficulty with (I eventually got them to let me throw things away after explaining why I need to do it for my mental health sake, and now my mom is very supportive!!) letting go of.

  
I have tried to watch youtube videos to help with sentimental clutter, but they did not relate to me or made me feel any better about getting rid of my toys. I‚Äôll always keep a few, but I have so many still that I just feel very stuck and embarrassed. I know people say it‚Äôs because ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not ready / it will come in time‚Äù my issue is, I FEEL ready, but I don‚Äôt know how to take the final step. I decluttered old Batman toys I had as a kid, and I have felt a bit better, but some days I miss them, majority of the time I don‚Äôt‚Äîis that contradictor? Yeah, probably, but I don‚Äôt quite know how to word what Im feeling. 

  
Does anyone with mental health issues also struggle with sentimental clutter? What helped you get rid of them without feeling guilty or upset? I have turned to this as a last resort because I feel very alone in this issue, and I am very embarrassed about it. Like I said, Ive watched videos, but none of them really hit home for me enough to motivate me to get rid of my sentimental clutter. If anyone has any advice or suggestion, hell, even just explaining your journey, please let me know. I genuinely feel so stuck with the sentimental clutter, and while Im working on it in therapy, I feel like I need more advice from others who experience these struggles.

  
Thank you, whoever reads this, and I hope each of you here reach your decluttering goals!! Reading through this form gave me new ideas and hope that I can get rid of more things in the future.",declutter,1737238163.0
Paper clutter is my nemesis and I know it's an inherited trait. ,"I have always found paper clutter to be my worst nemesis. I'm miles ahead of where I used to be, but there's always a two inch stack of paper that needs to be sorted/filed/shredded in my office. I try to go through it a minimum of twice a month. 

My parents house had always been ""full"" but never cluttered. It seemed like everything fit. We learned how cluttered it was after my dad passed and cleared out a number of things my mom didn't want to keep. 

But paper remained. My mom's filing system was to pay a bill, put it back in the envelope,  write the check date and payment date on the envelope.  At the end of the month, the stack was rubber banded together and tossed into a tub. Rinse and repeat. 

Then it finally happened.  She couldn't find something she needed. Thankfully she found it quickly, but it was stressful for a minute. 

We have spent the last several Saturdays going through the tubs, shredding what she doesn't need to keep. Taking things out of the envelopes and getting it all sorted into file folders.  The 8 years of paperwork she needed to keep fit in one bankers box. 

She couldn't be more excited knowing how easy it will be to keep track of everything going forward, but man... does it tell you your genes run deep, knowing it took me into my early 30s to get a handle on paper clutter and she is in her early 80s to get it sorted. ",declutter,1737234748.0

Change of perspective that helped me be more ruthless with decluttering,"I have been on a decluttering journey for four or five years. Decluttered every room of the house plus the garage. Up to now I must have decluttered hundreds of items. However, I still wasn‚Äôt happy with how some of the rooms looked.

So this is what I did this week. I imagined my best friend who hasn‚Äôt been at my place for several months comes over. What would her first impression be? Would she see any clutter? I started with the bedroom/office, because I spend the most time there.

The change of perspective worked really well. I noticed clutter that I wouldn‚Äôt even have identified as clutter before. Ashamed to say, but in this room alone I counted 18 cluttered spots. A few examples. On one wall there were outdated notes and to do lists. Went straight into the trash. A Disney comic book collection that I owned for years but never had time to read and wasn‚Äôt particularly interested in anymore. Why is that even here? Listed on Ebay and sold the next day. A large piece of wood attached to the desk that a router and cables were fixed to two decades ago. No longer needed. Went straight into the trash. A broken laptop and printer. Took them to the recycling center. Some reusable shopping bags hanging on the side of the desk. Took them to the basement where shopping bags are stored. Several rolls of wrapping paper in a corner. Why do I have to look at them every day when I use wrapping paper maybe 10 times a year? Took them to the basement.

Really happy with the result. Bedroom/office looks great. Probably the best it has ever been.

The only downside is that when I thought my decluttering journey is almost finished, I realized I will have to go through every room again with the friend perspective in mind. So more work ahead.

Hope someone will find this helpful.",declutter,1737226830.0

Help decluttering with sentimental family,"Anyone have any suggestions for motivating massive decluttering action while living with a very sentimental spouse and kids?
We're on a bit of a unique situation - family of four, kids now teens/young adults, who lived abroad for about 5 years as expats starting when the kids were preteens. While we did a but of purging before we moved our stuff into storage when we moved abroad, it was a pretty chaotic period, so a lot of old kid toys, books, clothes + my spouse's ''I'll organise it one day' stash just went into storage.
Now we're back in our home country, it feels like we're drowning in all the various stuff we collected in our travels plus what the lids/spouse see  as a treasure trove of memories from childhood. (Plus my in-laws just passed over the past year so we're trying to squeeze in childhood memories from my spouse)
I'm the only one in the family that feels stress from having so much stuff. My spouse and the kids seem to relish being surrounded by 'stuff' and tie a lot of memories to physical objects. Opening a box of old plastic toys has the three of them reminiscing about how they got that happy meal toy on a visit with gramma, or how they played with that little plastic figure with a friend when they were  5... every box opened is a multi day process, where every little item is categorised and days are spent making sure all donations (we can't throw anything out) are in good repair (Adding to the 'to be repaired' pile or the 'when we find the missing piece'  piles.) 
I've reacted by being overly aggressive with my own relatively meagre 'stuff' -eg.  I got rid of about 80-90% of my books just to have the calm of some empty shelf space and now spouse's stuff has taken over the empty space.
Does anyone have any suggestions on how to proceed?",declutter,1737213231.0
Decluttering is now saving me money.,"I needed to get rid of a lot of stuff I owned. I had until the middle of 2025 to accomplish this so I started off taking my time with it (begun September 2024), getting rid of a few things here and there, nothing extreme. Something happened where I technically have the same deadline but decluttering became my main focus, I didn't want to pace myself, I just needed space and to know I had exactly what I needed, a couple of things I genuinely want and love, nothing more and nothing less 

(Not to say being ruthless is healthy, if there's no rush then I think pacing yourself through the process is probably best).

Anyway, I am just about done with decluttering, and I can't explain how much better I feel mentally, I'm no longer overwhelmed with stuff. I treat each item I kept with more care (not sure why) and majority of my items have been given a new life elsewhere (sold and donated to charity). 

Now something I didn't think much about is through decluttering and feeling a massive relief and knowing what I have kept serves a purpose, I no longer wish to bring anything in without thinking about why I want it, what use it would be, the space it would take and most importantly if I'm going to actually use it enough to justify adding it to my things. For example a notepad/notebook, I have gotten into math teasers, I have a pile of printer paper and a small lined notebook with a good amount of fresh paper inside which I have been using to show my working for those math teasers. I got the urge to buy a squared notepad to use instead of all the paper I have... (I put the paper through the shredder when I'm done with it)... Long story short it was likely just a boredom want and I didn't end up buying it. Something so simple and cheap, doesn't take up much room either but if you do this with each item then it soon adds up.

Ofc I'm only human so I'm sure I'll cave and buy something spontaneously and likely regret it but I'm impressed with this intentional buying mindset which I wasn't expecting just by decluttering.",declutter,1737191373.0

Valentines Day, Christmas, birthdays, etc. Now we have two kids, and all the holidays that come along with that also result in heartfelt cards from him and ‚Äúfrom‚Äù the kids.

The advice for decluttering cards is always to keep the heartfelt ones or the ones with meaningful messages.‚Ä¶but they all have meaningful messages!!! It‚Äôs extremely difficult to just throw away what amounts to handwritten love letters from my family.  

What do I do? Surely the solution is not to stop giving and receiving heartfelt cards. But I don‚Äôt want all this paper hanging around!

How to declutter around a hoarder?,"I'm so frustrated right now. I started decluttering my book closet, and found clingfilm wrapped copies Friend of Farthing Wood magazines. They were clingfilm wrapped after an attempt more than 5 years ago to sell them on eBay when we realised they were too heavy to post, so back in the cupboard they went. I read KC Davis' book on tidying recently and told myself ""if I'm not going to sell or donate these, it's okay to throw them in the trash"". So I carried them out to my car on a run to the local tip to throw out with some large items. Except my mum saw it in the car and asked what it was. I told her it was the Farthing Wood magazines, and she looked all sad and misty-eyed and asked ""But why?""

That set me on a spiral because I just got mad at her for asking, because it didn't *need* explaining, and yet I tried to justify it, pointing out I got them about 30 years ago, how we're doing nothing with them. They aren't worth anything (I checked and a set about the same size as mine is listed for like ¬£35). She said ""Well it's up to you, you do what you need to"" but I could tell from her tone she didn't mean it, and she was upset that I was considering it. So I'm back from the tip, the damn magazines are still in my car, and now I'm feeling guilt for even considering doing it, but also resent the idea of putting them back in my room. 

I share the house with her but anything from my childhood is pretty much a no-go area. The loft is full of vacuum packed bags of my artwork and writing from the ages of 5-11, as well as old teddy bears. I think it comes from her still being regretful and upset about my grandparents apparently throwing away all her old toys and things from her childhood, because she's upset that she doesn't have anything, and of a family member who threw out old family photos because they weren't of his direct relations. Anything I try and point out I don't want cluttering my area she tells me to put in her closet, which doesn't solve the problem, just moves it until she passes away and I have to throw it away anyway. I'm trying to improve our living situation because it's so stressful and overwhelming having so much stuff, but the cupboards are just full of things she says she needs or that we'll use, so there's no room to put anything new that she buys.",declutter,1737136710.0

And then I grab a trash bag and start focusing mainly on trash. Food trash, empty water bottles or cans, old papers, dry markers, and empty boxes are common in my room. 

Just by getting up and getting started throwing away easy stuff it surprised me how simple it was to switch to active decluttering. Throwing away trash didn‚Äôt feel like I was making a sacrifice for stuff that I might potentially maybe need later (pro tip I decided it wasn‚Äôt worth it to keep a lot of those things). I have thrown out 6 trash bags of trash and 5 bags of donations in 2 days just by getting started by picking up trash. My room still feels like a disaster but I know that I‚Äôve began letting stuff go and that feels so good. The room is only 13x12 but I‚Äôm surprised that I used to live with this amount of stuff and I didn‚Äôt consciously feel claustrophobic. ",declutter,1737079382.0
Little Act of Decluttering: 2,"Today I went through the 2 massive (120cm x 75cm or 47x30 inches!) boxes of gift wrap, bags, greetings cards, ribbons etc and condensed down to one! 

I threw out (recycled where possible) battered bags and paper scraps and compiled a big bag to give away to a crafty neighbour.

I accepted a few things to help this:
1) I am not crafty, so pretty string and ribbons for tying packages is pointless
2) Stepkids are grown up so ‚Äúemergency party cards‚Äù are not needed
3) I usually buy gift bags specific to gifts at the time, so the stash I had was easily halved. I clearly never give wine at Christmas as I had 12 festive bottle gift bags‚Ä¶!
4) I‚Äôm always late with cards and tend to use t‚Äôinternet to send these as postage is quicker (plus I can add a ‚Äúsorry it‚Äôs late gift..oops)

Repository for all of the fams' stuff,"Couple of edits: the family heirlooms are 90% paper records, military history, tons of photographs to scan that is a work in progress. There's really nothing to display per se.

Also, FIL was actually StepFIL and hubs hated him. He was a miserable human being so there's no love or sentiment in his stuff.

I am an only child and my hubs is the oldest, which seems to mean that we are the repository for all of the STUFF from BOTH SIDES of the family. 

Both of us are really into genealogy so we have all of that. Fine, we both agreed to that and neither of us wanted actual family heirlooms falling into the hands of the dingalings in the families. But it takes up (2) 8' x 6' shelving units in our basement. 

My mom is about 1/2 way to hoarder and 3/4 to narcissist so for years she cleaned her house into mine. I finally put my foot down about a decade ago so I at least stopped the flow. Recently I've been working thru how I inherited her need to attach sentimental value to material things and was able to purge a garage space full of furniture and clothing off to charity.

My FIL and MIL passed away 3 years and 1 year ago, respectively. FIL was a hoarder. We have at least 8 of the largest size industrial storage totes full of their crap that does NOT include the above mentioned genealogy items. 

My husband was a very successful bicycle racer when he was in college and has the 2 bikes he used. I should add college for both of us was almost 30 years ago. He claims they were very expensive (I do not doubt this) and that he can now sell them (this is preposterous but pointing that out leads to an argument). 

Regardless, he's made zero effort towards that or sorting thru the contents of the massive totes. Just now, I gently mentioned that I needed for him to schedule a date with the basement to do his part. As usual, that was met with grumbling and excuses. 

This has all been emotionally exhausting for me. I am so proud of the work I've done to break the cycle of keeping *things* but I feel unappreciated and a littled duped that I did my part and I'm still going to be banging my shins on the godforsaken pedals of the 2 relic race bikes indefinitely.

Buy nothing: block after first flake? ,"My rate of getting flaked on whenever I try to give stuff away on Buy Nothing is like 60%. Soo frustrating. Yesterday I had a no show and blocked them. Today I asked someone if they could pick it up today, then they waited until nighttime to actually see how far it was then said they couldn't come today and asked if they could come tomorrow instead. I said ok but when do you think you'll be able to pick it up - it's been hours since they saw that, no response. So I just blocked them too, I would rather just toss this stuff than waste more of my time. I picked them on the condition they could pick up today in the first place. (And I stated what I'm close to but they needed to give me the address since they couldn't be bothered to just look it up. They said they didn't go to that landmark so they didn't know where it was - so lazy.)

I feel like I have to be more ruthless. Too many damn flakes! One flake and you're blocked.. or is that too mean?

Coming from this is similar experiences with many incredibly rude people on Facebook marketplace. I have a pretty low opinion of the general Facebook public at this point after hundreds of bad experiences. 

On both buy nothing and marketplace, almost no one bothers to actually read the description, like c'mon.

Starting from the bottom... Help ,"Hi all.. I'm a person with a lot of stuff. A neuro divergent trait of mine is discovering a new hobby/enjoyment, and absolutely going to town on it and accumulating loads of stuff related to it. As such I share a two bed flat with my fiance that is absolutely full to the brim of stuff.. a hobby graveyard of sorts.

Now a lot of the things I've accumulated, I love. For instance most of my crafts, my dolls, my Japanese art books. Some stuff, not so much. I have so many soft toys of various brands that I bought on impulse when I was younger that now just fill me with regret. 

I'm currently on annual leave from work and we have been trying to sort some of the stuff out. I did my bedroom today and I was so upset and overwhelmed by everything it almost made me want to give up on everything.

Additionally, I am regularly plagued by the fear of having to move out. How on earth would I ever ever get on top of all this stuff? 

I have considered selling but that also seems extremely overwhelming.

Does anyone have success stories from a similar starting point as me? I feel like I'll *never* get on top of this mess, and that I'll forever live in a cluttered flat, or have to move out and have a complete mental breakdown as a consequence.

Advice for Drastic Downsizing/Decluttering and Mental Exhaustion from Decision Making?,"I'd considered myself a minimalist in ""maintenance mode"" for many years, but I'm really struggling (for more than a year now) to declutter after drastically downsizing due to economic hardship. My three children and I are currently living in a tiny basement apartment (about 500 sq ft). I imagine how freeing it would be to just throw everything out, but when I try to take action, it is so time consuming and mentally/emotionally exhausting to try and get rid of anything. Financial insecurity is definitely a hurdle. I feel like if I get rid of something, I will not be able to replace it if needed.

Some examples:   
\- I don't regularly use all my pots/pans/kitchen items, but what about the one time a year I do?  
Maybe it would help to consider what I've used in the past year or envision what would happen if I didn't have this item? I saw a great recent post about leaning on community, but that's not really a good solution for me currently.

\- My 8 and 10 year old sons have more clothes than they need, but they are also very rough on their clothes. I'm often mending clothes due to holes. Or washing out stains/mud/etc. I'm afraid of them not having enough if I get rid of extras. Maybe it would help to decide how many of each item we actually need? I'd love to get rid of some of the sweatshirts/jackets.

\- Blankets! We have too many blankets, until the cold nights when my entire family goes through multiple sets of bedding and blankets due to the stomach flu (has happened more than once).

I think my biggest areas of opportunity are clothes, toys, games, school supplies, kids' arts and crafts items. I've already gone through these categories multiple times, and have made progress, but I still feel like more needs to be done.",declutter,1736886919.0

‚ÄúOne bag per day‚Äù rule,"I have so many house projects on my list, but I always seem to get stuck in a loop of ‚Äúbefore I can do this, I need to do that, and before I can do that, I need to do *that,*‚Äù etc etc. 

One of the projects that I really really want/need is turning an extra bedroom into a dressing room for myself. My house was built in 1950 and the closets are insanely small, and my morning routine is always so complicated by the fact that I don‚Äôt have a good space to get ready in. I also want to have laundry hookups installed so that I can do laundry upstairs in the room where the clothes belong instead of going up and down to the basement.

"Started yesterday, made a microscopic dent in Mess","Quick background. twice in the past 15-20 years-had professionals come in to clean my house. Between jan of 24 and now it devolved into the worst it's ever been. Not only clutter but filth.  I know how it happened-depression very bad over past year, perhaps some COVID effects on depression and stamina. I can't use my kitchen or my refrigerator, have kind of been backed into a spot in my den where I sleep, and eat. Take out every day for dinner-horrible. I also think there are some health issues impacting my ability to function-probably have sleep apnea-tired all the time. and the depression. For those of you who don't get it the analogy I use is that it's like you are telling me that I need to jump from one side of the Grand Canyon to the other. I literally feel physically paralyzed with fear and panic.

The last time I had the clutter people in, I think Jan of 24? this is stupid, but they took a bunch of stuff that was in my foyer, shoes-some very dirty on bottom,  purses, bags with stuff, and tossed them in the bottom of my tiny coat closet at end of day. I wanted to tell them we had to go through that  b4 they left, but at that point just wanted them to be gone. (It's not that they didn't do a good job-somehow scrubbed my kitchen to a shine, but it's just emotionally exhausting), staring at that pile got me so stressed out (this isn't an excuse just a description of how I felt) that I became paralyzed staring at it every day. And down I went. Had COVID again in May. Afterward, started leaving fast food bags and containers all over the place-why? My garbage can needed a cleaning! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I have every type of cleaning thing-great vacuum, steam mop, small steam cleaner, all kinds of disinfecting cleaners, mops etc, hoping would inspire but paralyzed.

OK that's the background. Yesterday I was determined to start-I am petrified that something will happen in my house that requires emergency maintenance, OR i GET SICK, and how will I let anyone IN. I started in living room put on TV-something suspenseful, put on a mask and gloves and got the garbage bags. Started with garbage on surfaces and anything else to be thrown out-but didn't do any putting away-moved downward to all the crap on the floor. (Seriously, I don't know who I am anymore.) Panicky that it took more than I imagined, and got significantly less done in an hour that I thought I would- but kept trying to push that to back of mind.  Also tossed stuff that I would ordinarily put away or think about giving away but I overthink everything so into garbage it went. Included dirty dishes because can't use kitchen.  

Worked for an hour and a half then made self stop. Filled a giant contractor bag that I started putting in garbage early summer(!) plus three standard kitchen bags. Took one to a can on a street corner (big plastic bin. Later while upstairs (One bedroom townhome about 1550 sq ft.) I gathered recycling from unwrapping/wrapping gifts -tissue paper, delivery boxes etc.   Washed clothes that were on floor and in a basket from early last year. FYI clean clothes draped all over.

I am so humiliated and overthink so much that just putting out the garbage stresses me out. In a townhome complex garbage day cans are out in front of our homes-I stress over neighbors wondering what the F- I have so much garbage/recycling for-and some are very nosy. Have had the same garbage men for a while--stress over what THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT MY GARBAGE! So I try to toss some at my mom's house some at work, even this stresses me out.

Anyway, just needed to share and looking for any advice. I have not provided too many details on the filthy part of this because just can't handle sharing that right now. I have to say, I find this ""group"" in Reddit much less judgemental than some other online options, maybe better moderated, and more people willing to be supportive.

Decluttering as someone who is low income ‚Äî getting over the ‚Äúbut what if I actually need this‚Äù trap,"**TLDR: If you are having trouble getting rid of things** **because you are also low income and worry that you**
**wont be able to replace it if you do need it in the** **future, I‚Äôve found success in relying on community** **for those ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios.**


I have a modest salary, and every month I have to carefully budget to make ends meet. With my career trajectory, I have spent all of my 20s and will spend most of my 30s making minimum wage in a HCOL area. 

A large part of my clutter is due to inability to let things go because of the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenario. If something comes up, I realize I likely will not be able to afford to purchase the item again. For example vegetable peelers. I have one that works fairly well and a second one that is kinda awful that I got for free 5 years ago‚Ä¶ but what if the good one breaks? Better to have a bad vegetable peeler than no vegetable peeler, right? And anytime I see something for free that seems like it could be useful?? You bet I picked that up and stored it away for a rainy day. Same with sleeping bags. I love to camp, and have one sleeping bag I love, and 3 sleeping bags that I got for free that I nestle in each other when I winter camp because I can‚Äôt afford a 4 season bag yet. Do I actually nestle when I winter camp? No I borrow my friend‚Äôs bag. But what if???

My perspective changed during my last move and an apartment flood. I had to rent a storage unit, which I certainly couldn‚Äôt afford, to house all this stuff that it turns out I really didn‚Äôt need or miss that much. And the items I did miss? I had absolutely no way of getting to given that my storage locker was filled floor to ceiling with unlabeled boxes. When I cooked in my temporary housing, I didn‚Äôt have a vegetable peeler, or a garlic press, or a mixing bowl, or really anything to cook with. I was lamenting this during lunch and do you know what a coworker said? ‚ÄúI meal prep so I don‚Äôt really use my kitchen stuff during the week. Let me know what you need and I‚Äôll bring it in tomorrow.‚Äù

This coworker, who I‚Äôm close with, but certainly not besties with, let me borrow their one vegetable peeler, one garlic press, one bowl, special pan, etc. I used it for a few days, cleaned it, and brought it back. And so I continued for the weeks that I was living in temporary housing. 

This whole experience made me realize it really is okay to rely on community in the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios. 1000% it‚Äôs okay to keep everything you need on the daily and maybe a backup, but all of those ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios? For the I-can‚Äôt-afford-another-if-it-turns-out-I-needed-this scenarios? It‚Äôs okay to rely on community to help you out. 

I‚Äôm slowly in the process of decluttering about 50% of my possessions. It feels good to find loving homes for my items on buy nothing groups. With the mental clarity that comes with empty drawers, free hangers, etc I am much more able to invest in my community. I actively seek out ways to help others with my possessions, and I feel confident knowing this energy will come back around if I‚Äôm in need again. Currently I have friends borrowing some of my Tupperwares as well as my volleyball. 

I also feel that asking for and giving help is a wonderful way to feel more connected to people and our communities. I really feel that corporations are the only ones that benefit from this hyper-independent ‚Äúyou must have every item you could possibly need‚Äù mentality. 

Also my modest income still allows me to buy 2 or 3 ‚Äúbuy it for life‚Äù items a year. Borrowing items I need in a pinch vs buying cheap frees up money so I can intentionally spend on things that I believe will have the greatest impact on my day to day life. ",declutter,1736794093.0

Helping my mom declutter in February.,"As long as I remember my mother has difficulties with throwing away stuff. I wouldn‚Äôt call her a hoarder but the stuff that was in the house rarely left the house. After my grandmother (her mother) died she took over a lot of the stuff from her to ‚Äòsave it‚Äôs (her brother just wanted to throw everything away). Since three years now she has the house for herself after me and my siblings moved out. 

In conversations I‚Äôve had with her last year she admits more and more that she wished that she would succeed in decluttering the house completely because she is realising that this isn‚Äôt a nice house to live in and she feels shame about all the stuff in the house. 

Last Christmas my two siblings and I gifted to her that I would come to her house an entire week (I live quite far) to help her clean everything together with my two siblings. 

But I know if I don‚Äôt have a proper strategy we most definitely will not succeed in helping her.

Things I already thought of are making an appointment with the local second hand warehouse to pick up a lot of stuff (so she will know the stuff will not be burned or destroyed and that will help with letting go certain things) and renting a large container in front of the house for al the stuff that‚Äôs already broken.

The advice I‚Äôm looking for are ways to let her have the feeling that she ‚Äòsaw‚Äô everything and that she has the feeling that she can co-decide what happens with which stuff but that we still can move forward and don‚Äôt waste too much time.

I try to ensure everything in our house has a home. But besides going to the ""one in, one out rule"", is decluttering a lifetime commitment?

It's not because my home is small. In fact, it's 3 residences taking up over 5K sqft., with 2.5K sqft carriage house, and a full basement that had 2 illegal apartments in it. I could store and keep as much as I like.

It's not because I didn't have much. I've had plenty. It's simply that I've learned over the years that very little is worth moving. There is ""stuff"" every where you go. It's not expensive if you know where to look. It's easier than at any point in history to acquire ""stuff.""

So the items I moved were those things that really mattered to me. The most sentimental.

I went looking for memento from college to take a picture and share with a friend. Because I didn't find it initially, I opened an old box marked ""childhood dolls and photos."" To be clear, I thought I had already opened and stored ""childhood dolls."" I have them stored in an armoire, and get them out occasionally for visiting children to play with. I also had a box of unsorted pictures from my grandmother's albums and ones I had taken with my camera as a little girl. Imagine my surprise when I found MORE handmade dolls (HomeEc projects that I don't have sentimental attachment to), and a lot of rubbish photos to trash. In all, I found 2 small handmade items to store with the rest in the armoire, and reduced the photos to a small box that held only the pictures and moments I felt sentimental about. The dolls are lovely and worth donating. The rest went into the trash. 

Even with the 7 linear feet of items I moved, I have decluttered 2 boxes of sentimental items; I've decluttered bags of clothing (new climate, new time of life, wardrobe updates, etc.); I still haven't filled the rolling stainless steel tool chest; I've donated one of the 3 dish sets I brought; And I'm still holding onto a sideboard I plan to turn into a sink basin in a room up next to renovate.

This box had clearly not been opened in over 25 years. I recognized the label and know it was a labeling style I used early in my first marriage. I think it's made at least 7 moves since it was last taped up. I am pretty good about going through things, but I only do what I have time and energy to do. So it has taken me this long to get to it.

It was an absolute delight to see all of these items. I had a great time going through the box. My partner urged me to NOT declutter anything (his family are hoarders with the property and inclination to go far past what most people are capable of). 

And yet, I know if I kept those items, the chances are it might be another 25 years or more before I saw them again. At that point I'd be quite advanced in years. My kids would only care about the few photos and handmade items I kept. I would be keeping things I'd never see, look at, or remember. Keeping them for someone else to have to trash in a distant future. I felt such peace enjoying them one more time, and then moving them on. The memories, the people are what I love, and the love is in my heart. NOT in stuff I don't see or use.",declutter,1736723001.0
Declutter win: pared down my mementos/photos from two large bins to one shoebox sized basket.,"I got a new bed frame and this forced me to tackle the demons lurking under my bed: boxes of mementos and a whole bunch of random stuff and Chernobyl sized dust bunnies. I'd been avoiding it for the longest time but the bed purchase sort of forced my hand.

I had two of those long boxes designed to fit under beds full of stuff and went through all of it and got rid of duplicate photos and photos of people that aren't a part of my life, exes and on and on. I have one shoebox sized box full of stuff now. 

My new bed has a higher clearance under it so I am going to be able to store seasonal stuff like my Christmas tree/decorations/wrapping paper under there now and after decluttering, it's going to feel like I have SO MUCH SPACE.

Y'all, I have a small condo, 930 sq ft with my two kids. And I think by the time I am decluttering I will actually have *unused space*.

I need help decluttering collections ,"I'm thinking of moving out soon, and I own a lot of different collections. Items I own include figurines, plushies, nail polish, manga, video games etc. A lot of these items are in piles in the house as I don't have enough space for them.

The problem is that I love all my stuff and am having trouble decluttering. I own so many figures that I'm finding it hard to keep up with dusting them and it stresses me out. Most are still in their boxes (The boxes themselves take up a lot of space too).

I also own a lot of clothes as my weight fluctuates. The clothes that don't currently fit me are in bins outside of my room. I'm afraid of getting rid of them if I ever get to that weight again. I was unwell at the time of owning them, and am wondering if I should rid of them solely based on that (that weight wasn't good for me).

(I‚Äôm new-) how to avoid just ‚Äòshuffling deck chairs on the titanic‚Äô?,"So the bookshelf in our living room has been a stashing place for like 5 years. This week my husband rescued a box of books- almost 100 year old dictionary and reference texts that he finds interesting. I sort of rather not fill our house with that ‚Äòjust to have‚Äô but I can empathize so fine. That led to him spending an hour and a half tearing up the living room bookshelf to make space to get them off the floor. A few things were pitched like old receipts. 

Many things I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do with like hard copy souvenir photos from the beach last summer that maybe one day we will frame and put up on the wall. So I just carried that to a guest bedroom shelf for now. The biggest issue is that when we moved in, my husband wanted to repaint the built in shelves in the office because the knots were showing. So all my many fantasy novels etc are in piles on the guest room floor. It felt bad shuffling books from the living room bookshelf to the guest room floor. I have no idea when he will get to that.

I was in the hospital for a few weeks for a manic episode and now my house feels impossible to maneuver around.

"I have accepted the need to declutter clothes due to an upcoming move, and could really use more motivational tips after some initial progress!","Background: I'm an avid thrifter who needs tall sizing, and I've spent a decade finding pieces that fit my body that couldn't easily be purchased new. I have 3 generously sized closets, a dresser, 4 bins of underbed storage, and 4 other large bins totally filled with clothes and shoes.


Now that I know I will be moving in 2 months to a place with much less storage, I've been trying to ruthlessly pare down to moderate success. Using some of the mindsets I've read here, this is the approximate progress I've made:


* 75 long sleeve shirts to 50
* 40 pairs of shoes to 25 
* 70 t-shirts to 55 
* 40 pairs of pants to 30 
* 40 dresses to 25 
* 35 skirts to 20
* 20 shorts to 10 
* 60 coats/jackets to 40
* 30 sweaters to 20
* An uncounted number of scarves, belts, bras, handbags, swimwear.


Now, this is still clearly way more than a single person needs, but I'm getting to the point where it's getting really tough to let go of anything else. 


Can you please tell me I'm doing okay so far, and help motivate me/suggest tips to keep going? My mom recently said that I shouldn't declutter too much since it'd likely be anxiety-driven about moving to a smaller space and I've worked so hard to find all these things, and hearing that really slowed me down!

I am now up to 3 full laundry bags, and also have a large duffel bag full of other things to donate.

Don‚Äôt Worry About Documenting; Just Do It,"Story time! My New Year‚Äôs resolution was decluttering. My goal was to declutter an item a day, so I‚Äôd at the least have gotten 365 things out of my house. I set a daily habit on Hello Habit (an app) to ‚Äúdeclutter‚Äù at 9 AM. I set the rule that I could put as many items as I wanted in my donation area on any day, not limited to one item. I also like data, so I started a spreadsheet to show what I was donating; I was curious what my biggest category would be, or if I had any trends I could identify.

On January 8, I gave up on tracking. Each morning, I‚Äôd look for something to give away, or trash, and that would take about 30 seconds. Then I would immediately see something in the same drawer, and put that aside, too. And then I‚Äôd realize, you know, I am uncomfortable in this itchy sweater, so it should be donated, too. I don‚Äôt have ADHD or anything, but I‚Äôd just catch the bug every time and realize I didn‚Äôt want to stop decluttering to update my spreadsheet.

What was I going to do with this data, anyway? I‚Äôd make one post here showing my findings, and then I‚Äôd forget about it. My time is better spent just continuing to declutter, post to my Buy Nothing group, and find better homes for the things I just don‚Äôt use. Before I stopped tracking, I had given away 45 items in just a week. My neighbors are benefiting from my huge clean-out, and I‚Äôm not slowing down.",declutter,1736556930.0

Decluttering/Organizing Paperwork?,"Someone made a post about vet bills and it was such a good question.

Small collections may help you declutter further,"Does anyone else really appreciate curated, small collections? I find it a bummer when someone shows off massive collections as I feel it's no longer about having things that bring you happiness, it's about showing off how much money you spent. It also just doesn't look as nice. I love seeing peoples small, curated collections of whatever thing they're into, each piece selected for a specific reason. But when I see massive ""hauls"" or collections online it just starts to look like...stuff. 

Just a thought I have as I've been very anti clutter for years and have recently started carefully, thoughtfully letting myself collect a couple things (physical movies and a certain small doll that starts with fadudu which also go with my existing weird creature collection). But I'm being sure to be mindful to only buy the ones that I will truly appreciate and enjoy AND have a designated place for. 

My tip I'm sharing today as, I've been big on decluttering for a while, is to allow yourself a few things that you keep not because it has a function but because it brings you joy to see it. Then you will realize the clutter around it is distracting from the things you want to highlight, thus encouraging you to pair down and/or avoid buying things you don't truly love or need.

Decluttering Disappointment,"How do you deal emotionally with decluttering items you know you need to replace?

At the start of December, my family and I went through our kitchen, and basically did a whole clean out of everything to figure out what we didn‚Äôt/couldn‚Äôt use anymore. 

Some of it was legitimately good progress, like the cooking pans that have bits flaking off, the wooden utensils, a cutlery set we don‚Äôt use, etc. 

But one part in particular was a hard blow. We had a whole cupboard full of reusable water bottles, that has had to go in the trash, because they all grew mold. We‚Äôre talking 20+ bottles btw. Now matter what we did, we just couldn‚Äôt get rid of it (dishwasher, hand scrubbing, vinegar soaks, bleach, google hacks), so in the bin they went. Some of them were well over ten years old, so they didn‚Äôt owe us anything, but now we‚Äôre looking to essentially replace them all, and it just feels like such a waste.

Logically, I know, that interacting with mold is bad, so they HAD to go, but replacing them is going to be frustrating, and I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to get over that resentment and disappointment.

Friday 15: T-shirts!,"This week, it's time to tackle the T-shirt monster! T-shirts tend to breed because (a) they're useful garments and (b) they're the go-to memorabilia for every band, 10k, high school musical, and other event. Thanks to u/Live_Butterscotch928 for suggesting this one.

Pull out all your T-shirts! The first step is a simple sort into:

1. Wear shirt: these are any T-shirts that you regularly wear, or that are similar to ones you regularly wear but got lost in the back of a drawer. Graphic T-shirts that you regularly wear belong in this stack.
2. Memento shirts: these are T-shirts you don't intend to wear (or could wear but never do), but you still feel sentimental attachments.
3. Why shirts: these are any T-shirts where you have no idea why you still own them. These are going straight to fabric recycling, donations, or trash, depending on condition!

Now, the first two categories get different treatments.

For **Wear Shirts**, the goal is to keep enough shirts for your regular laundry routine plus a couple days and maybe a few unusual occasions. Every shirt should fit, be in good repair, be a flattering color, go with your other clothes, and not annoy you when you're wearing it. If there are 50 shirts that meet these criteria, keep the *best* ones. (If you are hard to fit, a deeper bench is justified. You may want to store back-up shirts separately.) Remember, Wear Shirts include graphic tees that you actually wear! 

Your **Memento Shirts** are not going back in the drawer with Wear Shirts. Here's where we face the hard question of whether the shirts are actually acting as mementos. If they're stuck in a drawer or a box somewhere, where you're never looking at them, then they're not really eliciting fond memories. Pick an approach that makes the memories present in your life. You can frame the best graphics. Everyone always suggests a T-shirt quilt or pillow. You can put photos in your album. You can choose the best three T-shirts and keep them in the Wear Shirt drawer so they make you smile when you open it. 

In the comments, share your favorite stories that a graphic T-shirt reminds you of!",declutter,1736515941.0
Declutter guilt / personalized items,"I just moved and after moving I realized how much unnecessary stuff I have. Especially clothes bc I find myself wearing the same things.

I'm finally doing a big paper declutter and it's such a relief,"I'm finally doing the paper declutter I started and abandoned several years ago. I was working through the Marie Kondo method and got rid of a lot of books and clothes etc but found the paper decluttering to be endless and overwhelming.

I had a health scare last year that reminded me how short life is and to just get on with things I need and want to do. The paper clutter was making me feel overwhelmed, confused, anxious and depressed because it was lots of paper from old courses, unfinished projects, old bills etc. Stuff I'd not looked at in several years and didn't need but the process of going through it all always felt like a 'some other day' job when other things felt more important.

I have managed to work through lots of it in the past two weeks, I just have a few more drawers to go through. My recycling bin is already full and I've had to empty the shredder already. Our council gives us a small paper recycling bin and a big 'tins and bottles' recycling bin, I have fed back to them during their recent consultation that a big paper recycling bin would be much more helpful since the paper recycling bin gets full quickly of things like cereal boxes and envelopes etc. I think the small paper recycling bin was actually one reason I'd been delaying getting rid of all the paper (I can't drive at the moment due to an injury so I can't drive to the local recycling centre).",declutter,1736515355.0

So, is there any reason I might need to keep the bills for my living cats?  Half the bills are for cats who crossed the Rainbow Bridge at least 3 1/2 years ago and obviously they can go, but the bills for my living cats do detail the treatments they received, and that seems like it might be useful information.

Clearing out wardrobe - feeling wasteful!,"I've committed to a no buy 2025 for clothes! I'm really excited to commit to it. Now I begin to declutter what I already have, however I find it really hard to clear out without feeling wasteful.

It's all the boring pieces, not the special/interesting pieces.

I have things that I don't use often (ie. so many plain colour t-shirts and long sleeve tees, scarves, pajamas) but I feel like I shouldn't get rid of. For example, I mostly wear black and white tees (useful for casual wear, office wear etc) but I have so many different coloured tees that I just don't wear, but then also feels wasteful to get rid of. Same with pajamas - so many old PJs that are still good in rotation but I don't need so many sleep singlets. Long sleeve tees - I live somewhere that's cold for 6 months of the year and have so many long sleeve tees, good for layers, but I only ever really wear the same 3-4 on rotation. But then it feels wasteful to get rid of perfectly good things! Like I feel like I should keep them for when the ones I wear all the time wear out. But realistically I should just get rid of them and then in a few years when I need to replace something, I can just replace whatever I need to.

Having a good place to donate makes it a lot easier to let go,"I've been going through my sewing room in preparation of a big project that I've been putting off for at least a year (maybe two) - so maybe more procrastination than anything.  BUT we have a free community Craft Closet in our town and I donated a bunch of do-dads last weekend.  

Yesterday, I was talking to my neighbor who was telling me about the Craft Closet (in case I didn't know) and how she got a bunch of really nice ribbon and a whole jar of safety pins.  That was me!  That was my ribbon!  And those were my safety pins!  

So I just went back through my sewing drawers and pulled out even more things to donate - if she thought that stuff was good, she'll probably love what I thought were ""keepers.""  I'm going to send her a text to take whatever she wants and then I'll donate the rest.

It's so easy to collect ""could be handy,"" ""maybe someday"" hobby stuff - some of it is super-cool, let's base a whole project around it - but some of it (maybe most of it) is pretty pedestrian (or was just on sale/clearance).

Every year I haul them out and don't put them on the tree, but keep them in the decoration bin. I just put them away year after year because I don't like them. Eleven months of the year they are stuck in a closet and I don't think of them. I don't want to see them next year, and I am so happy that I don't have to. I am tired of taking up space storing a bunch of crap.",declutter,1736383643.0

Do you think the way you were raised impacted your desire to declutter?,"I enjoy cleaning and organizing my space and do not hesitate to throw away /give away/ recycle most of the things (more difficult with clothes and accessories). Every time I realize that I have an expired hand cream I'd instantly throw it away

And I think this desire to clean, declutter and organize came from the fact that I grew up in the opposite conditions. My mom would keep everything, even empty shampoo bottles, broken matches, creams that are years old etc. I have always been annoyed by it, like its amazing if your stuff can get a second life and make someone else happy or you can recycle it for the planet's good. But some things are just...trash?

It'd never turn into drastic piles but she'd have ""slashes"" all over the flat.

When I was moving to another country I couldn't bring a lot of stuff with me, but I also didn't want it to collect dust at my mom's place. So I had one of the biggest declutters of my life, when I got rid of 3 bags of different things. She wasn't happy, but I knew it was for good.

Update on my clothes n clutter situation,"https://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/s/JiOvyDFWoz copied my other post! 

But I‚Äôve officially conquered my scary cluttered room. I‚Äôve got 5 boxes of stuff to donate and three bags and I had two bags earlier this week as well. Every time I‚Äôve cleaned out in the past 6 months (about 5 times) I‚Äôve had 2 garbage bags full of stuff to donate. It‚Äôs been insane. Idk how I have so much stuff. I am looking into renting a storage unit for some larger stuff I plan to keep as I genuinely don‚Äôt have room for them bc I live with family still but they‚Äôre pieces I love. 


I also want to say whoever commented the tip that when you buy something donate 1-3 (?) objects similar well that has helped so much. I got a pair of brand new winter boots I‚Äôve been searching for forever for at a thrift store and donated 4 pairs of shoes when I got home üòä. I‚Äôm really seeing my purchasing and items I own in a different way. I like having a wardrobe full of my own staple pieces that I love and adore. It‚Äôs ok to have a few new things to try styling but if it doesn‚Äôt work no reason to keep it when someone else could use it. 


Thank yall so much for your tips!!! It really helped :). ",declutter,1736365455.0
Kids Stuffies What to Do?,"So, my 8 year old daughter has a ton of stuffies. For the most part she can remember where and who she got them from. She has 6 or 7 on the bed, three under the bed trays full, a small hanging bang on the back of her bedroom door, and a big basket of them.

We don‚Äôt try to buy her anymore, and we‚Äôve communicated to relatives to not buy anymore for holidays etc.

I have tried to work with her to get rid of some but she gets super upset.

I don‚Äôt want her to be a hoarder later in life, but I don‚Äôt want to unnecessarily traumatize her now.

I figure she will stop wanting stuffies in the next few years anyways.

Anyone else dealing with this? I think if she knew some were going to children who needed them, she would be good to go. But there aren‚Äôt many places who will take used stuffies.",declutter,1736364857.0

Sad that I‚Äôve lost sentimental items in clutter,"Little over a year ago, I moved into my current place. I didn‚Äôt realize how much clutter I‚Äôd built up till I had to move. It was a rushed move so when my friends, partner, and I were packing up my things, everyone just threw everything randomly into boxes. It was so overwhelming when we moved all of my boxes into my current apartment because nothing was separated or labeled.

Now that I‚Äôm moving again, I‚Äôm actually taking the time to declutter. However, as I‚Äôm finally unpacking all of my clutter to downsize and move into a new place, I‚Äôm finding that I may have lost some very sentimental belongings, and I‚Äôm struggling to push through the sadness and guilt.

Overwhelmed with shorts collection ,"I have a massive collection of shorts that I've accumulated since 2022. I would estimate somewhere between 100-150 pairs in my closet and under my bed.

I live in a warmer climate where I am outside a lot and go to the gym at least four days a week. So naturally I wear shorts for most occasions. However, my problem is that whenever I purchase a type of pair, I get it in multiple colors to match with different tops. I have all kinds of fits and inseams depending on how I want to look at the moment.

I now have no room in my closet because of this habit. This has been an unhealthy obsession of mine that I am now addressing and eager to fix. But I'm currently going through my collection feeling overwhelmed and defeated. 

Any tips and advice would be much appreciated.",declutter,1736318070.0
I'm ashamed and overwhelmed by my clutter,"As a young adult I was an unintentional minimalist. I moved frequently and had very little disposable income, so everything I owned fit into a few suitcases. I remember feeling like the king of the world when I finally bought myself a bed and a sofa to go in my first solo apartment. Having my own furniture in my own space was such a big deal. No more rented bunks or shared rooms. Financial stability was so liberating! I went a little crazy buying and collecting all the things I couldn't have before, and there was no one to tell me not to.

Fast forward a decade and I now feel paralyzed by all the things that once brought me so much joy to acquire. I feel like there is stuff everywhere just gathering dust. I have stacks of books that don't fit on shelves, clothes without drawers or hangers, half finished projects, gadgets, and knick knacks in every room. I don't know if it's actually as bad as I've built up in my head, but I look at all this STUFF and just see money that was once so hard to come by and I could have used more wisely. Getting rid of anything feels like throwing that money away, but I can't keep it all!  
  
I used to love hosting and now I avoid having people over because I feel like I need to hide all the clutter. This includes my lovely partner of several years, who has never even seen my bedroom because it's hiding my mess. I always find excuses for us to stay at her home instead. I very much see myself spending my life with her, and we're seriously talking about buying a home together. But I know in order to do this I'm going to have to tackle the issue of the clutter. I've started picking away at it, trying to sell or donate things here and there, but it's been a very slow process and I keep getting overwhelmed and frustrated. Any advice on how to tackle this once and for all?",declutter,1736317373.0
I'm a pack rat but my husband is a full-blown hoarder. I feel stuck even finding a starting point to declutter. Help!,"(First time post on Reddit, I think ever. On mobile, hopefully the formatting doesn't come through as a wall of text.) 

I've always been a bit of a pack rat (and ADHD), but I had gotten a lot of support from family and friends, and I had found some success at keeping a tidy home and getting rid of stuff like clothes I was no longer wearing. My stuff fit in my space and generally looked nice and orderly (although it wasn't perfect). I still had stashes of things I didn't really need, things like a tote box of things I haven't even looked at in 20 years, or a pile of small cardboard boxes for ""just in case I needed to mail something."" 

Then I got married. Seven years later, my husband doesn't even like it when I throw out clothes that have gotten holes in them, because they hold sentimental value for him. There are issues of trauma from his past that make it painful for him to let go of things. So I feel like I have to sneak throwing away even my own clothes that wouldn't even be good enough to donate. He saves stuff like used jars and Ziploc bags and other stuff that I had put into the trash. His house before I married him was so stuffed that he said you had to turn sideways to get through the small path through the living room to get between the front door and the kitchen. I thought love would help him and he would not do this again. Famous last words. 

We have accumulated so much stuff in seven years, and I don't even know exactly how it happened. We used to be able to fit two cars in our garage. Now it is filled side to side, front to back, stacked higher than my head. Our wheelbarrow sat outside in the elements all summer because we couldn't find a spot for it in the garage. 

We built a 12 x 20 foot storage shed in the back yard to hold boxes of stuff, and now it's filled front to back, stacked higher than my head, and there's not even aisles to walk in to get to the stuff in the back. 

All the closets and cabinets and drawers in the house are full to overflowing. We have nice stuff that is *who knows where* so we don't even get to enjoy the use of it on those occasions that we would be presumably ""saving it for"" if we were debating whether to get rid of it. 

I'm afraid the house is next on the list of becoming a full-blown hoarder house. I'm holding that at bay, or at least I'm trying... But I was trying to hold it at bay with the garage, too, and I lost that battle. 

This past weekend I tried to just take on a small thing - the top of my dresser - and I got the surface cleared off and the mirror washed. That felt really good, but it's already stacked again with piles of excess clothes that didn't have anywhere else to go. 

Two years ago, I was in tears on Christmas Day because I felt so hopeless over how bad everything had gotten. A year ago, I was so angry about it, I told my husband I felt like burning it all down, and he promised me he would work on it, but nothing ever happened. Feels like I'm going through the stages of grief here, LOL! 

I feel stuck and lost and completely inadequate to know how to tackle this. But the clutter is taking a toll on my mental health and I really want to fix this. Help! Has anyone been in a similar situation? 

Any tips or advice? Is this possible or is it a lost cause? Any ideas on how to make progress and not constantly get discouraged by setbacks? ",declutter,1736306955.0
Dealing with Overflow of Husband's Stuff,"I wouldn't say I'm a super-clean person, but clutter definitely gets to me. I get anxious when items accumulate and I feel satisfaction in getting rid of things I don't use. My husband is generally clean and organized, but he has a lot of hobbies, and he doesn't like getting rid of things. I love that he has so many different passions (he's not a pick-it-up-and-put-it-down-2-months-later dude‚Äîhe commits) but it feels like items related to his interests leak all over the house. 

What I find most frustrating is the kitchen. I do the majority of the cooking, but our counter space and table are frequently covered in items related to his projects. This makes me not want to start making a meal or use these spaces. We both have offices, and my thinking is: our stuff stays in our offices. (I don't care at all what his office looks like.) Some of my frustration certainly comes from feeling like he has free reign of the house while I compress my own belongings into a small space.   
  
I guess my question is: is it fair of me to ask that he contain his hobby-centric tools/vessels/etc. to his office? I get insecure that I'm unfairly trying to maintain my individual level of tidiness, while of course we both live in this home. I wouldn't mind him using the kitchen and other parts of the home for certain projects if the paraphernalia were just put away after. ",declutter,1736306467.0

"I tell myself ""you are not losing things, you are gaining time, mental capacity and space""","I kept repeating these things to myself, and it really helped me cut down on the stuff I owned. I still want to keep going, but its nice to see progress :)

every single thing you own has to be taken care of, just like a pet. 

you already bought it. it is already in your house. do not think about how much it was or how unique it is. if it is not serving you, then you are serving it.

more stuff means more time and energy organizing. is having this stuff worth the amount of sunk time and energy? TIME IS LITERALLY PRICELESS, SO HAVE SOME PERSPECTIVE

do you want 10 cute sweaters that are all pilling because you cant take care of them all, or 2 really nice sweaters you can upkeep?

do you want to waste time deciding which lotion/skincare product to use every single day?

do you want to take care of mounds of stuff or have time to rest/have fun/work on yourself?

less stuff = faster clean up

less stuff = more time saved

less stuff = room for possibilities

I need more motivation! please share your thoughts

Help me come to terms...,"I am part of a group where we give each other things for free. Someone needs a winter coat. I have had one sitting in my basement for 2.5 years. No longer fits me (I had a baby) and I have a new coat that does fit me. I have been meaning to put it in donation so I was going to let it go anyway. But now that I can give it away I am having a tough time because it cost $300 (plus tax) and also, I loved the coat! And a part of me is hoping I will lose weight (I am trying to) and then it will fit me. The usual reasons for not letting go of a piece of clothing.

Can you help me come to terms with passing it on? Clearly someone needs a coat (it felt like -4 F last night) and I am not getting any use of it. Still, I doubt I would ever be able to get myself as nice a coat in future (no longer dropping $300 on a piece of clothing), and what if I do lose weight???

Get rid of clothes and random stuff????,"I'm 21 and I've always been a collector of random things. Not even collections of stuff, just random stuff.

I have a bunch of shirts that are sentimental or cool to me but I dont NEED all of it. 

Right now I'm trying to work on my closet and clothes. 

I have too many clothes but the thing is that I actually do wear all of them. Part of it might be because I'm really bad at doing laundry regularly so I probably have a bit of extra clothes. 

Right now I'm living at school for the semester and after that I need to store all my stuff in a small space so that I can go overseas for an internship. 

I like making outfits and dressing cool and interesting but half the time in the winter at least I just end up wearing a sweater. But then ofc I have like 10 sweaters?!

I like wearing nice stuff to class but then I work in a coffee shop and don't want to stain my stuff so I change into less nice stuff. But then on other days I work in housekeeping cleaning bathrooms so I need to change into not nice stuff.
